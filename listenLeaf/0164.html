    <p>,

(93) It's therefore possible to eat a simple diet consisting of just a few different kinds of properly designed meals, as long as they include all the necessary macro and micronutrients. However, the general recommendation is to eat a varied diet, for the same reason people are told to buy index funds when investing--namely, a lack of knowledge.
By eating a wide, random selection of what is sold in the market, it's believed that all needs will be covered.</p>
    
    <p> In a similar vein, much can be done to alleviate the effects of diabetes by avoiding all high-glycemic food. However, again people are told to eat the normal varied diet because it's believed to be easier to teach them to inject insulin before each meal than it is to restrict their diet and internalize an admittedly long list of glycemic indices. And given the one-size-fits-all approach,
the institutions are probably correct. Knowledgeable individuals may make better personal choices, however.</p>

(94) I hate to sound like a Luddite, but from the perspective of financial and consumer independence, nearly everything was done better in the "old days." Many modern innovations are only an improvement insofar as one is a shareholder of the company producing them (See Foundations of economics and finance).
(95) Take care of cast iron pans and they will last a lifetime--that is, your lifetime.
(96) Someone who is used to walking will clock just under 4mph on a sustained basis.</p>
    
    <p> Sedentary people or hikers who are not used to fast walking barely reach 2mph.
(97) This is not compensating for the likelihood that the cyclist is likely healthier than a sedentary driver and is thus inherently expected to live better and longer.
(98) These pertain to US traffic regulations and generally don't hold in Europe.
(99) If we have, unknownst to me, reached the point of personal bathroom assistants, I don't want to know about it.</p>

(101) Although I must admit that practically all TV shows show people living a high-consumption lifestyle, and while they may have all sorts of interpersonal problems, they never seem to have any money problems.</p>

(102) Libertarians (believing in low economic control, low social control) have a similar problem when dealing with left-wing (believing in high economic control, low social control) people or right-wing (believing in low economic control, high social control) people. With either group there is something to agree with, but there is also something to disagree with. A preference for agreement or truth comes down to personality type.
(103) They are finite on time scales shorter than geologic time scales.</p>

(104) In a capitalistic society, this option is not open to all, but neither is working (100% employment).
(105) If you haven't started making money yet, seriously consider getting into a field with guaranteed income potential. About the worst thing anyone can do financially is to spend four years piling up student loans for a degree with a low starting salary. Here it's not so much the starting salary which is the problem as it's the debt.</p>
