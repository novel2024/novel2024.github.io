    <p> But we’re also apt to treat it with high-handed imperiousness, expecting it to do our bidding as if it were a docile servant. Pay attention to this, we tell it; remember that; buckle down now and get the job done. Alas, we often find that the brain is an unreliable and even impertinent attendant: fickle in its focus, porous in its memory, and inconstant in its efforts. The problem lies in our attempt to command it.</p>
    
    <p> We’ll elicit improved performance from the brain when we approach it with the aim not of issuing orders but of creating situations that draw out the desired result.
Instead of dictating to a student the information she needs to learn, for example, have her explain it in front of a group of her peers; the gestures she makes will generate a deeper level of understanding. Instead of handing an employee a manual packed with guidelines, create spaces and occasions where stories—full of the tacit knowledge manuals can’t convey—will be shared among his co-workers. Instead of instructing a team to cooperate and work together, plan an event (a shared meal, a group hike, karaoke!) where synchronized movement and mutual physiological arousal are bound to take place.</p>
    
    <p> The art of creating intelligence-extending situations is one that every parent, teacher, and manager needs to master.
The final principle of extension doubles back on itself with a self-referential observation. What kind of creatures are we? The kind who extend, eagerly and energetically, when given the chance. Consider: research from neuroscience and cognitive psychology indicates that when we begin using a tool, our “body schema”—our sense of the body’s shape, size, and position—rapidly expands to encompass it, as if the tool we’re grasping in our hand has effectively become an extension of our arm.</p>
    
    <p> Something similar occurs in the case of mental extensions.
As long as extensions are available—and especially when they are reliably,
persistently available—we humans will incorporate them into our thinking.
Accordingly, the ninth principle: whenever possible, we should manage our thinking by embedding extensions in our everyday environments.
Think of the cues of belonging and identity, for example, that bolster our motivation and improve our performance when displayed in our study and work spaces.</p>
    
    <p> Recall the transactive memory system we construct with a group of colleagues over time, in which the burden of attending to and remembering information is distributed across group members. Picture, even, the indoor plants and “green” walls and roofs that help restore our attention by providing regular glimpses of nature. Once securely embedded, such extensions can function as seamless adjuncts to our neural capacity, supporting and augmenting our ability to think intelligently.
It’s worth noting that this principle bears a bias toward stability: enduring cues of belonging and identity are hard to sustain in an office where “hot-desking,” or unassigned work space, is the norm; a transactive memory system is difficult to build in a work environment where turnover is high or team composition is constantly changing.</p>
    
    <p> In a dynamic and fast-changing society that celebrates novelty and flexibility, the maintenance and preservation of valued mental extensions also deserve our respect. We may not know how much they bolster our intelligence until they’re gone.
 THIS NESTED SET of principles, what we might call a “curriculum of the extended mind,” is not currently taught in any school or addressed in any workplace training. That ought to change; learning to extend the mind should be an element of everyone’s education.</p>
    
    <p> At present, to the degree that people know how to extend their minds, it’s something they’ve figured out on their own. Strikingly,
we now have evidence that individuals do differ in how fully they have developed their capacity to extend. Furthermore, scientists have found that this competence can be accurately and precisely measured, using a variation on conventional IQ tests (which, in their unaltered form, deliberately exclude all kinds of mental extensions: test takers are not permitted to use tools such as calculators or the Internet, nor are they allowed to move their bodies, rearrange their environments, or talk to their neighbors). Most intriguing, results from these studies show that skill at employing extensions, as assessed by a test,
corresponds to real-world performance: empirical evidence that individuals who can extend their minds more fully can solve problems more effectively in everyday life.</p>

In February 2019, a group of psychologists from the Netherlands—plus philosopher Andy Clark—published a study in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The researchers set out, they wrote, “to quantitatively assess a powerful, although understudied, feature of human intelligence: our ability to use external objects, props and aids to solve complex problems.” They started with a conventional test of intelligence, the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices; this IQ test, used millions of times all over the world since it was first introduced in 1938, presents users with a series of geometric puzzles, each of which is missing a piece. Test takers are asked to select, from a number of options provided, the piece that correctly completes each pattern.</p>
