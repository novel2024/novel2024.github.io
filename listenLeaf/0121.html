    <p> I do admit that coupons offer spectacular savings, but these savings are almost exclusively concentrated in preprocessed foods. For our purposes, we only really need to shop in the grain, meat, and produce sections. Not clipping coupons saves time organizing them as well as running around to different shops to use them.
A search will generally reveal one, or at most two stores nearby (see Transportation) that can supply all your needs.</p>
    
    <p> A systematic search may be in order: Travel all the streets of your city and visit all the stores, making a note of their prices and selection. Relying on junkmail or chain stores usually isn't the best solution. Put in some footwork! It's good exercise.
Set a strict food budget item: You'll notice that your total caloric intake will fall.</p>
    
    <p> You'll eat less processed food; likely none at all. As a result, your general health will improve and your long-term health expenses will decline, maybe to a point where you don't need to stay employed to be able to afford your required medical care.
Budget $80/person/month for food and only shop once a week, keeping track of food costs with a notebook or by paying in cash. As novices (see Gauging mastery) may find it challenging to spread the budget equitably over the entire month, dividing it into a weekly budget may be helpful.</p>
    
    <p>Building up a store of food, thus decoupling shopping from cooking, allows one to wait for sales and thus to spend money almost exclusively on sales. This only works with storable food groups. Here, a freezer is much better than a refrigerator, and if I could choose only one, I'd choose to have a freezer over a refrigerator, but I'd rather have neither. This may be surprising, especially considering that we tend to believe that everything needs to be refrigerated.</p>
    
    <p> However, see the next section for suggestions of what can be stored without the noise and electricity usage of a refrigerator or freezer. Storing also avoids having to engage in the proverbial scramble for milk, eggs, and bread whenever the weather forecast is unfavorable.
Optimizing utensils In general, simple meals are easier to cook. This means less need for unusual ingredients or utensils, less time spent preparing, and less time cleaning up.</p>
    
    <p> The simplest meal is the one-pot meal. You will find many ideas for one-pot meals in cookbooks focusing on slow cookers. These can be eaten directly out of the pot. Many cultures do this.</p>
    
    <p> A better choice than the slow cooker is the traditional slow cooking setup: the hay box.94 Instead of an actual hay box, put the pot under the blankets of the bed. This also heats up the bed. Alternatively, use an old sleeping bag, or a cardboard box inside a bigger cardboard box with newspaper shreddings in between.</p>
    
    <p> The ideal pot for this is a pressure cooker because it naturally seals, but take the rubber gasket off or use an old one when in slow-cooking mode to keep it from wearing out. Pressure cooking also radically cuts down on time and fuel use as well as making some dishes much easier. For instance, I have never burned any of my rice in a pressure cooker because the heat comes from the steam pressure rather than from the bottom, which it does in a conventional boil.
Specific diets also influence the choice of utensils.</p>
