 BUT: FRUITFUL PROXIMITY is one thing; continual distraction born of unenclosed,
unprotected spaces is another. Appealing though it may be to modern sensibilities, the coffeehouse was always a terrible model for a place in which complex, cognitively demanding work is to be carried out. That’s because the conditions created by the open-plan workspace are in direct conflict with the unalterable realities of human biology. The brain evolved to continually monitor its immediate environment—to be, in effect, distractible, lest nearby sounds or movements signal a danger to be avoided or an opportunity to be seized.</p>
    
    <p> And organizational environments are full of the kind of stimuli that distract us most.
First: humans are especially attuned to the presence of novelty, to whatever appears new and different. The pull of the novel on our attention is an efficient evolved strategy; it would be a waste of our time and energy to keep noticing the many things around us that don’t change from day to day. But our selective attraction to the fresh and new becomes a problem when we operate in environments that are hubs of constant activity and change.</p>
    
    <p> Psychologist Fabrice Parmentier, who researches the effects of acoustic distraction, reports that unexpected sounds “ineluctably break through attentional filters,” and end up distracting those who hear them—“regardless of the sound’s informational value.” Our attention, he notes, is subject to “involuntary capture” by any sudden or surprising noise.
Second: we are especially attuned to the sound of speech, especially when the words are distinct enough to make out. Any ambient noise can grab our attention, but intelligible speech is particularly distracting, because its semantic meaning is processed by our brains whether or not we want to be listening.</p>
    
    <p>
What’s more, the speech we can’t help overhearing is processed by the same brain regions we employ to carry out the kind of knowledge work done at the office, like analyzing data or writing a report. Involuntarily auditing speech, and trying to complete tasks involving words or other symbols, means drawing on the same limited resource, with the result that we have “less brain” to devote to each. In a 2014 study conducted by researchers from the University of Gävle in Sweden, participants were asked to write short essays under five different acoustic conditions. Background noise in the five conditions ranged from 0.</p>
    
    <p>08 to 0.71 on a measure called the Speech Transmission Index—that is, from completely unintelligible speech, to somewhat intelligible speech, to crystal- clear speech. The participants’ writing fluency, the investigators reported,
dropped “drastically” at Speech Transmission Index values above 0.23—levels that, they note, “would not be at all uncommon” in an open-plan office.</p>

Third: we are especially attuned to the nuances of social interactions, alert to what people say to one another, and to what we think they will say. In an effort to master our interpersonal world, we’re constantly making predictions about what will unfold in the social exchanges that go on around us. Our habit of projecting forward makes it especially hard for us to tune out one-sided conversations, such as those we hear when others near us are talking on the phone. Research by Lauren Emberson, an assistant professor of psychology at Princeton University, has found that we are more distracted, and our cognitive performance more impaired, when we overhear what she calls a “halfalogue” than when we catch both sides of an in-person dialogue.</p>
    
    <p> When we hear only half of a conversation, it’s more difficult to predict when the speaker will pause or resume talking, and what that person will say to their unheard-by-us conversational partner. In a study Emberson published in 2010, participants asked to complete verbal and motor tasks started to make mistakes just moments after they began hearing a halfalogue.
What about wearing headphones? That takes the problem and puts it directly into our ears. Like overheard speech, music with lyrics competes for mental resources with activities that also involve language, such as reading and writing.</p>
    
    <p>
Music has been found to impair performance on tasks that are difficult or complex, as well as those requiring creativity. And it’s not just the words.
Music, with its insistent beat and catchy riffs, is engineered to grab and hold our attention. Studies suggest that music with high intensity, fast tempos, and frequent variation is more distracting than more low-key, laid-back music.</p>
