    <p> Move on to fixing flats, cleaning, changing oil, and lubricating parts. Graduate to disassembling the drive train and engine.
A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new opportunities. Similarly, life advice like the above should not exclusively be for the purpose of saving money--although it'll come in handy later in Important financial ratios--but to build social cohesion and connections and learn and exercise skills that can later create opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>
This way, saving money won't be seen as consumer deprivation but as producer manifestation; you're now making something rather than buying it.
In my opinion, that makes you a more interesting person.
Another very common--and in my opinion very bad--piece of advice, at least for the purposes of attaining success as a Renaissance man is to pick and focus exclusively on one thing, say hair cutting. This may be fine if you need to make a career out of it, but if you only need to provide for yourself and possibly a few friends there's no need to specialize and develop all skills sufficient to be marketable; just focus on your own hair.</p>

However, without changing one's frame of mind from that of a consumer, solving daily problems by learning a bunch of new things and doing them yourself runs the risk of turning into a multitude of hobbies (see here), as supplies are ordered from stores, clubs are joined, or projects become overly ambitious, at least in terms of acquiring the tools and supplies. This could therefore easily end up strengthening the dependencies of this figure, first running out to stores to buy supplies and then running back to work to pay for them, leaving little time and room for the project,
which eventually moves out to the garage with the rest of the stuff.
Therefore, a requirement is to make each project self-supported. To understand what this means, divide the projects into three groups (and everything in between) Projects that cost money Projects with start-up costs and regular fixed costs (see Depreciation schedules).</p>
    
    <p> You need to buy equipment and pay subscription fees or replace equipment that wears out on a regular basis. Many sports fall under this category.
Projects that are "free" Projects with few start-up costs, no fixed costs, and no cash flow, but possibly network connections of learning skills or providing some value. These projects are free.</p>
    
    <p> This can include using things you already have, such as a computer and an Internet connection.
Projects that earn money Projects that are saving you money or--even better--making you money; not as in a hopeful future, but now. This could include learning how to cook, fixing computers, mowing people's lawns (for the exercise), babysitting, etc.
It's of primary importance that a project produces value, even if that value isn't money, and doesn't destroy value.</p>
    
    <p>
Money leaving your pocket is a big warning sign that your activities fall into the first category. These should be avoided as much as possible and replaced with or modified into activities that are "free" but provide the opportunity to learn, meet new people, and possibly earn money eventually.
It's often quite possible to find a direct, yet free, replacement for a cash- negative activity. For instance, rather than going to the movies, you can borrow the DVD from the library or a friend about six months later if you just change your perspective.</p>
    
    <p> Don't get too ambitious about making money right away. Serendipity plays a larger role in the long term. For example, I replaced my fascination with buying computer hardware (expensive money sink) with learning about the *nix operating system (free) and eventually ended up as the system administrator of the department I was working in simply because I was the one who knew the most when the previous admin left. Later I turned the knowledge of emacs and LaTeX from writing scientific articles into a freelancing job as a copy editor, which covered all my expenses working approximately 30 minutes a day on average.</p>
    
    <p>
Blogging was another activity that started as a constructive way of channeling my writing and eventually turned into this book, which I typeset myself using what I learned as a copy editor. My interest in economics grew out of my interest in geopolitics, and eventually turned into an interest in investing, that I combined with my savings, which came from my interest in not spending money by doing more things myself, and so I was able to devise a custom-made portfolio that suited my particular investing temperament.
Over time, this approach automatically develops several diversified streams of cash, as well as many more means to save money and keep that cash. Yet, cash flow is not the only measure of independence.</p>
