    <p>" It is a full-body movement, which strengthens practically the entire body from the neck to the knees.
The clean and push press works practically all the muscles in your body and it's a great power movement. If your desire is to be strong (but with less endurance), the ultimate exercise is the deadlift.
If done with dumbbells or kettlebells, these are relatively simple movements.</p>
    
    <p> If done with a barbell, you may want to get someone to show you. I prefer kettlebells. Do-it-yourselfers may realize the same benefits by filling a sturdy duffel bag with sandbags made out of duct taped Zip-loc bags.86 A high work capacity is physically equivalent to sustaining a high power output (keeping a light bulb lit on a rowing machine), which means being able to do a lot of work in a short time (stacking sacks of corn).</p>
    
    <p> Since this is very exhausting, training is done in intervals.
The optimal interval for strength and endurance is the Tabata interval,
which means 20 seconds of all-out exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest and repeating this sequence throughout the entire workout; that is, working roughly 2/3 of the time. Increasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes strength. Decreasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes endurance.</p>
    
    <p> Pure endurance aims for working 100% of the time.
To increase work capacity, a good progression is first to increase strength, then to increase volume, and then finally to increase power by shortening the rest intervals. It works like this:
1. Increase strength sufficiently to do a few reps.</p>
    
    <p> This is efficiently done by using this entire program at a lower strength requirement at first.
2. Build up the volume. Suppose the entire volume is 100 repetitions.</p>
    
    <p> In this case do 100 reps with enough rest in between to finish. You may take all day if you like--for example, doing 5 reps every hour all day until you reach 100. Once you can do this every other day without overtraining, move to the next step.
3.</p>
    
    <p> Unless you picked a completely unrealistic strength level, most people will start at this point. Now, 100 reps can be divided into 100 reps×1 set, 50×2, 33×3, 25×4, 20×5, 18×6, 14×7, 13×8, 11×9, 10×10, etc.
Doing 1 set should take exactly 1 minute, rest included (use a watch!).
Hence, 33×3 will take 33 minutes to complete.</p>
    
    <p> The program adjusts with power capacity--for example, once 18×6 can be completed in good form, move on to 14×7. Once you reach 7×14, say, rest periods will be very short and you will be close to being able to do the exercise continuously, for example, as a power-endurance exercise. At this point move to a higher strength level and start over.
This is a very generalized way of laying out a program and it can be used for any kind of exercise such as push-ups, squats, power cleans,
rowing, sprinting, etc.</p>
