    <p> Yet it’s just this range of voices that must be heard if the group mind is to exert its unique power. One solution, says Sunstein, is for leaders to silence themselves; the manager or administrator who adopts an “inquisitive and self- silencing” stance, he maintains, has the best chance of hearing more than his own views reflected back to him.
The second way in which group thinking differs from individual thinking is this: when thinking as part of a collective, we need to make our thought processes visible to others on our team. While we do leave “traces” for ourselves when engaging in private thought—underlining, jotting notes in margins,
moving papers from the “unread” pile to the “have gone through” pile—these traces must be far more specific and explicit if they are to be used productively by others.</p>
    
    <p> Philosopher Andy Clark, observing the progressive delegation of our mental operations to our devices, has noted that “the mind is just less and less in the head” these days. More than that, the mind must be less and less in the head,
and more and more emblazoned on the world, if we are to extend our minds with the minds of others.
Once again, verbal communication is key—but not of the unstructured type that too often conforms to and confirms our individual-oriented model of thinking. Rather, researchers recommend that we implement a specific sequence of actions in response to our teammates’ contributions: we should acknowledge,
repeat, rephrase, and elaborate on what other group members say.</p>
    
    <p> Studies show that engaging in this kind of communication elicits more complete and comprehensive information. It re-exposes the entire group to the information that was shared initially, improving group members’ understanding of and memory for that information. And it increases the accuracy of the information that is shared, a process that psychologists call “error pruning.” Although it may seem cumbersome or redundant, research suggests that this kind of enhanced communication is part of what makes expert teamwork so effective.</p>
    
    <p> A study of airplane pilots, for example, found that experienced aviators regularly repeated,
restated, and elaborated on what their fellow pilots said, while novice pilots failed to do so—and as a result, the less experienced pilots formed sparser and less accurate memories of their time in the air.
Another way to make our thinking visible to others is to collaborate on the creation of what Gary Olson and Judith Olson call “shared artifacts.” The Olsons, both professors of informatics at the University of California, Irvine,
have spent more than three decades studying how people think and work together. One major contributor to the success of group cognition, they have discovered, is the effective use of such artifacts, or tangible representations of the task to be completed—which are, ideally, large, complex, persistent, and revisable.</p>
    
    <p> Over the course of their long careers, the Olsons have often evaluated the effectiveness of workplace technology such as video-conferencing software and digital collaboration platforms. But the baseline against which they compare these tools—the working arrangement they regard as the best of all worlds—is decidedly analog: a group of people gathered together in a room that is dedicated to their current project, with plenty of space on the walls to tack up those shared artifacts (which may take the form of lists, graphs, charts, or sketches).
It matters above all that these artifacts are, in fact, shared. At one design meeting they observed, all the participants were handed individual copies of a system diagram.</p>
    
    <p> “As they discussed and agreed to things, they took notes on their own copy of the diagram, adding things and crossing things out,” the Olsons recounted in one of their academic articles. “We noted at the end of the meeting that different people had made different marks, implying different understandings of what they had agreed to.” Without the capacity to refer to a single shared artifact, the Olsons concluded, these co-workers “ended up not ‘singing from the same sheet of music.’ ” In addition to being shared, it’s beneficial for group artifacts to be large and complex.</p>
    
    <p> The Olsons have found that people often gesture at large artifacts,
enhancing their own thinking and that of the people who observe them;
meanwhile, a complex artifact (as opposed to a simple or schematic one) allows more of the group’s thinking to be explicitly represented for all to see, rather than remaining concealed inside individuals’ heads. Finally, shared artifacts are most effective when they are persistent—preserved, retained, and kept continuously visible—but also revisable, able to be changed as new information or insight emerges. Describing another team at work, the Olsons noted that this group’s artifacts “were often put up in the order in which they were produced.
People knew where to look for something because they knew when it was produced, and they could tell something about another person’s attention by seeing where that person was looking.</p>
    
    <p>” Lamenting the “inherent invisibility of much of today’s computing artifacts”—we can’t see what’s inside our colleague’s laptop, any more than we can see what’s inside her head—the Olsons report that the best materials with which to create these representations are simple ones: a felt-tip pen, used on large sheets of paper.
There’s a third way in which group thinking diverges from individual thinking: when engaged in the latter, we of course have access to the full depth of our own knowledge and skill. That’s not the case when we’re thinking collectively—and that’s a good thing. One of the great advantages of the group mind is its capacity to bring together many and varied areas of proficiency,
ultimately encompassing far more expertise than could ever be held in a single mind.</p>
