However, complexity also has a cost because maintaining increasing levels of complexity requires increasingly more effort. For instance, the human brain uses an enormous amount of energy relative to the size of the body it controls compared to other mammals. This implies that there is an optimal point of functionality where the efficiency--that is, the ratio of functionality to maintenance and storage cost--peaks. The purpose of education, living, interacting, and growing as a person should be to increase complexity--that is, to progress through the stages from copying to creating as described in Gauging mastery.</p>
    
    <p> Without this progression, the brain is overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of facts, stuff, relations, appointments,
etc. If information is simply accumulated (compiled), one should expect at some point to be forgetting practically as fast as new things are learned--it is just the brain's way of being efficient on its own.37 This is particularly true when the focus is on compiling facts instead of reducing facts to principles and synthesizing more general theories (see Gauging mastery).
The same principle holds when accumulating things without learning new and better ways to use them, or when building relationships without connecting them into a community.</p>
    
    <p> Similar arguments can be made for computing--that is, taking on more and more work, hobbies, and responsibilities. The maintenance costs simply grow larger and larger, and if no complexity is created, adding another fact, thing, or relation to the "collection" will eventually grow functionally by O(1)--that is, not at all,
due to the "one thing at a time"-constraint, whereas the maintenance costs will grow by O(N).
The main mistake when dealing with an overwhelming amount of data and stuff is to reduce it, rather than relating to it on a more abstract level.
It's always easier to cut away than it is to create, but it's not always the best solution.</p>
    
    <p>
While abstraction reduces the number of concepts (see Building blocks) to deal with, decoupling further reduces it by decreasing the number of relevant interactions or "degrees of freedom." It's very difficult to deal with more than a few degrees of freedom because the number of possible interactions has super exponential growth.38 Decoupling decreases the strength of the interaction between parts. Interaction may either be described as static, instant, or dynamic, depending on the characteristic (time and/or space) scales of the parts.</p>
    
    <p> Think of a static interaction as dealing with a wall--it stays put no matter how you push it. A dynamic interaction would be like pushing a person--the other person responds to your pushing, but you can't just extend your arm freely. An instant interaction would be like holding a ball in your hand--if the hand moves,
the ball moves. It's more difficult to come up with a good analogy for space,
but having a large room with plenty of storage to spare would correspond to the static situation--you could put your thing down anywhere in the room.</p>
    
    <p>
Having "a place for everything and each thing in its place" corresponds to the instant situation, while the dynamic situation would be a room that's almost full and where one would have to rearrange things to fit things in.
Other dimensions such as financial, physiological, intellectual, emotional,
etc. (see Human capital and necessary personal assets) are also relevant and obey the same guidelines.
In general, interactions are easiest to deal with if they're not dynamic.</p>
    
    <p>
For example, the "hurry up and wait" approach in many complex organizations is the attempt by one agent (your boss) to make the output of other agents (you) appear static in his world as he consequently deals with a world of static problems. This is the optimal solution for your boss as you can't be expected to solve problems instantly, and dynamic interaction would require far more interaction and planning from the management side.
Conversely, making this coupling dynamic, thus increasing the degree of freedom (to fail), is frequently a source of profit since "hurry up and wait" is an inefficient strategy when agents are only capable or allowed to do one thing because a complex system has not been developed. From this it immediately becomes clear why "hurry up and wait" management strategies tend to dominate complex organizations, whereas smaller organizations are more dynamic.</p>
    
    <p>
This coupling problem often comes up with workload management. For a creative person, workload management with external constraints is especially stressful. A manager executing simple procedures may more easily divide his day into 15-minute slots and do different things in each slot.39 A creative person and even a craftsman can't do so, as both need time to retool.</p>
