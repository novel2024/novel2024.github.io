    <p> The results confirmed his own experience: the backpackers’ responses were 50 percent more creative following extended exposure to nature. Strayer, who also studies the distracting effects of digital media, believes that an enforced separation from phones and computers played no small part in the hikers’ increased ability to think creatively. Our electronics are deliberately engineered to grab our attention and not let it go; our devices work against the diffuse mental processes that generate creativity, and escaping into nature is one of the only ways we can leave them behind.
There’s another way in which the digital respite we get in nature could enhance our creativity.</p>
    
    <p> The time we spend scrutinizing our small screens leads us to think small, even as it enlarges and aggrandizes our sense of self. Nature’s vastness—the unfathomable scale of the ocean, of the mountains, of the night sky—has the opposite effect. It makes us feel tiny, even as it opens wide our sense of the possible. It does all this through an emotion that we confront most commonly in nature: awe.</p>
    
    <p> Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, has led much of the recent research on awe;
he calls it an emotion “in the upper reaches of pleasure and on the boundary of fear.” One of the pleasurably fearsome things about awe is the radically new perspective it introduces. Our everyday experience does not prepare us to assimilate the gaping hugeness of the Grand Canyon or the crashing grandeur of Niagara Falls. We have no response at the ready; our usual frames of reference don’t fit, and we must work to accommodate the new information that is streaming in from the environment.</p>
    
    <p> Consider the physical behavior that accompanies awe: we stop, we pause, we stare with eyes wide and features slack, as if to let in more of the scene that has so astonished us. The experience of awe, Keltner and other researchers have found, prompts a predictable series of psychological changes. We become less reliant on preconceived notions and stereotypes. We become more curious and open-minded.</p>
    
    <p> And we become more willing to revise and update our mental “schemas”: the templates we use to understand ourselves and the world. The experience of awe has been called “a reset button” for the human brain. But we can’t generate a feeling of awe, and its associated processes, all on our own; we have to venture out into the world, and find something bigger than ourselves, in order to experience this kind of internal change.
Scientists who study awe have also found that it alters the way we regard other people.</p>
    
    <p> Brain scans of people who are experiencing awe find that the region of the brain that contributes to our sense of occupying and orienting ourselves in space becomes less active. This diminished activity would seem to underlie the feeling we have when awestruck that the boundaries between ourselves and others have become more permeable, that we are part of a larger,
connected whole. In behavioral terms, people act more prosocially and more altruistically following an experience of awe. They share and cooperate more in games after having watched a video of sublime scenes of nature; after having gazed up at a grove of old-growth trees, an experiment found, people were more likely to bend down and help pick up pens that a stranger (actually a confederate of the researcher) had dropped on the ground.</p>
    
    <p>
The “functional” account of awe—biologists’ and psychologists’ attempt at explaining why we feel this emotion—proposes that it spurs humans to put aside their individual interests in the service of a collective project. Members of the species who were inclined to feel awe, the story goes, were better able to band together to accomplish essential tasks. By extending ordinary thinking with awe at nature’s immensity, humankind may have ensured its own survival—a reminder to us, perhaps, to look away from our small screens long enough to confront the dangers that threaten our kind and our planet today.
 THE OCCASIONS FOR awe available to our forebears are the same ones that move us now: mountains, oceans, trees, sky.</p>
    
    <p> But there is one all-encompassing encounter with the natural world that, to date, has been experienced by only a handful of our contemporaries: the view of Earth from outer space, as glimpsed by astronauts. So emotionally overwhelming is this sight—and so consistent are the psychological consequences for the few who have seen it—that scientists have given it a name: “the overview effect.” “If somebody’d said before the flight, ‘Are you going to get carried away looking at the earth from the moon?’ I would have said, ‘No, no way,’ ” recalled Alan Shepard, an American astronaut who walked on the moon in 1971. “But yet when I first looked back at the earth,
standing on the moon, I cried.</p>
