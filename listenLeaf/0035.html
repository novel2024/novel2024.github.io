    <p>" For instance, Alfred Wegener, the discoverer of plate tectonics, the theory that explains the motion of land masses, allegedly was inspired by looking at the collision of pack floes while camping on the ice.
Until such a method is found, there's likely an upper limit to the level of complexity humans can handle. On the other hand, it's my opinion that adaptation/complexity is exactly what makes us human. Compared to other animals, there's always some other animal that is either faster, taller, bigger,
stronger, or better-looking.</p>
    
    <p> However, there are no animals that beat us in the decathlon of life, and this is why humans are at the top of the food chain.
Adapting to complex situations makes it possible to substantially increase the level of resources and the number of possible solutions. It's like having a toolbox instead of a hammer when it comes to problem-solving.
Economic classifications The two degrees of freedom in this figure describe four different types.</p>
    
    <p> I call these the salary man, the working man, the businessman, and the Renaissance man. In most cases a person will identify with aspects of all four, yet a person's behavioral habits from one type tend to dominate those of the other three, allowing us to classify any person as one of four types.
The totality of all people forms an ecosystem or a culture of four interdependent types of differently behaving and differently thinking kinds of humans. Each type of human tends to fill a different niche of society.</p>
    
    <p> In different periods, different types will dominate the culture. The nondominant types will be considered undesirable or unrealistic, whereas the dominant type will generally be considered the "right" way of doing things and, soon, "The way we have always done it." People of the dominant type effectively characterize the culture and will justify their actions saying, "Everybody likes to..</p>
    
    <p>." or "All normal people like to...</p>
    
    <p>" Those living differently will be questioned, "What would happen to the present institutions of society if everybody started behaving like you do?" For example, the alarmed economist questions what would happen to the economy if everybody stopped consuming and started living on a quarter of what they used to. The answer is simple: The economy would be different.
Some institutions would vanish and others would form (see Succession and the cycle of change and Breaking out).
The salary man Most salary men are specialized wage earners who earn money from one source only.</p>
    
    <p> Often, they have no control over the source of the money.
For instance, they can choose between having a full-time job or having no job at all. This scarcity creates competition for full-time jobs (see Job Competition) rather than a continuous and less competitive distribution of effort between all wage earners. The jobs which specialists are typically hired for comprise a fairly narrow set of tasks.</p>
    
    <p> Their job is to use certain resources and turn them into certain parts of a final product. Thus, salary men have little control beyond their well-defined job descriptions.
Salary men have options, but they do not create options. This linearization makes them predictable and subject to indirect control.</p>
