    <p> The study subjects who (unwittingly) acted out the metaphor “on the one hand . . . on the other hand” generated nearly 50 percent more potential uses for the building,
and independent judges rated their ideas as more varied and more creative.</p>
    
    <p>
Such experiments suggest we can activate a particular cognitive process by embodying the metaphor that has come to be associated with it. Simply moving the body through space is itself a loose kind of metaphor for creativity—for new angles and unexpected vistas, for fluid thinking and dynamic change. The activation of this metaphor may help account for the finding that people are more creative during and after walking than when they are sitting still.
Daniel Schwartz, dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education, often urges his doctoral students to walk with him as they brainstorm about their dissertations, rather than remaining seated in his office.</p>
    
    <p> In 2014 one of these students, Marily Oppezzo (now an instructor in medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center) decided to investigate empirically the effects of walking on creativity. In a series of experiments, Schwartz and Oppezzo administered several different tests of original thinking to groups of Stanford undergraduates, Stanford employees, and students from a nearby community college. Some students were asked to complete the tasks while taking a stroll through campus or while walking on a treadmill; others took the test while seated in a classroom.
For the first test, participants were asked to generate unexpected uses for ordinary objects, such as a brick or a paper clip.</p>
    
    <p> On average, students came up with four to six more uses for the items if they were walking rather than sitting down. Another test presented participants with an evocative image, such as “a light bulb blowing out,” and asked them to come up with an analogous image (like, for example, “a nuclear reactor melting down”). Ninety-five percent of students who walked were able to do so, compared to only 50 percent of those who remained immobile. “Walking opens up the free flow of ideas,” the authors conclude.</p>
    
    <p> Studies by other researchers have even suggested that following a meandering, free-form route—as opposed to a fixed and rigid one—may further enhance creative thought processes.
Although contemporary culture prescribes sitting still while thinking, a stroll through the history of literature and philosophy finds ample evidence of a counter-message. Remember Friedrich Nietzsche, from earlier in our journey.
“Only thoughts which come from walking have any value,” he maintained.</p>
    
    <p>
Søren Kierkegaard felt similarly. “I have walked myself into my best thoughts,” remarked the Danish philosopher. Walking is “gymnastics for the mind,” observed the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. “I am unable to reflect when I am not walking; the moment I stop, I think no more, and as soon as I am again in motion, my head resumes its workings,” averred the Swiss-born philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
    
    <p> The French philosopher and essayist Michel de Montaigne lamented that his thoughts often came to him when he was on the move, at moments when “I have nothing to jot them down on”; this was wont to happen “especially on my horse, the seat of my widest musings.” These great thinkers were clearly on to something. We ought to be finding ways to integrate movement into all our daily activities, to tap into the mobile intelligence of “the mind at three miles per hour,” as the contemporary writer Rebecca Solnit has called the mental state induced by walking. This could mean walking on a treadmill as we type at our computers, walking as we talk on the phone, walking as we conduct work meetings—even walking as we attend class.</p>
    
    <p>
Thinking while walking would seem to be a natural fit for the world of academe. A few years ago, philosophy professor Douglas Anderson of the University of North Texas got to wondering why he and his students stayed put in a lecture hall while the texts they studied so often extolled the merits of movement. He began teaching one of his courses, “Philosophy of Self- Cultivation,” while on the move: professor and students walk about the campus as they discuss the week’s assigned reading. Anderson says he has noticed a difference in his students as soon as they leave the room where the class initially assembles: their voices and expressions become more animated, they have more to say, their minds seem to work at a faster clip.</p>
