    <p> A whole lot of people are taken advantage of because they do not know the tactics employed by manipulators. If you do not know that manipulators have a thing known as the mirroring technique, you might think that you and your date simply have amazing chemistry when this is definitely not the case. A good thing about manipulators is that most of their techniques are already in the books and all you need to do is grab yourself a book and get to reading. This way, you will be able to stop any predator in his tracks before he gets too close to cause you any harm.</p>
    
    <p>
In the same breath, the free availability of information means that you can always look up someone so that you authenticate their identity before they get a chance to grab anything from you. Gone are the days when you had to hire a private investigator to carry out a background check on someone. In today’s world, it is possible to run a background check on someone on the Internet and have the results ready within minutes. This could either be a paid background check or a quick cursory check of their social media pages.</p>
    
    <p> Fortunately, almost the entire world is on social media nowadays,
and a majority of us love to overshare.
Simple Strategies You can Adopt to Protect Yourself Whether you consider yourself highly vulnerable or resistant to manipulation, it always helps to be safe rather than sorry. Luckily, it is possible to keep the narcissists, psychopaths, and high Machs at a safe distance in your life. How so?
Psychopaths are present in our workplaces, in business transactions, in our personal relationships and even in our families.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes, you just cannot avoid a psychopath by virtue of the nature of the relationship that exists between the two of you. For instance, it might be impossible to ignore or avoid your psychopathic boss because you need to do your job, get paid and advance in your career, or at least pay your bills. If your boss is a psychopath, you just have to deal with him somehow. You might, for instance, have to figure out a way of keeping your interactions to a bare minimum at most.</p>
    
    <p> However, if you ever have the choice to not deal with a psychopath, grab it and run. For instance, if you are starting to get to know a new person with the intention of dating them and start to realize some tendencies that match the psychopath criteria, run and do not look back.
You do not need to stick around something or someone that is not good for you.
Do not fall into the trap of thinking you can change a psychopath,
sociopath, or narcissist into being a better person.</p>
    
    <p> Not only is this not your job, but it is also virtually impossible. For starters, the things that make people dark and manipulative are so deeply embedded in their psyche that they cannot just be removed and replaced with sugar and spice at will.
Secondly, change is a personal choice that is made by an individual. A person that changes does so because they want to change and not because another person asked them to.</p>
    
    <p> Last but not least, if you are dealing with a psychopath and thinking that you can change them, you are essentially waging war against biology and genetics. Who do you think is going to win?
Pay attention to actions more than you do words. Predators are very good with their words because words are their most powerful tools. Instead of focusing on what a person says, look at what they do.</p>
    
    <p> Did they fulfill the promise they made to you about doing a particular thing? Do they treat everyone as well as they want to make it sound? A simple way to check whether a person’s actions match their words is by utilizing something that is referred to as the rule of threes.
Here’s how it works: if a person seems to tell a lie or makes a promise that they do not keep on one occasion, you may be dealing with a simple misunderstanding. If this happens a second time, there is likely to be a serious mistake that requires addressing. However, if there is a third occasion, then you are probably dealing with a liar.</p>
