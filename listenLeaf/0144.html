    <p> But in the US, many of these services are provided for by corporations to those who are salaried corporate employees--this is made possible through group negotiation power similar to trade unions at the employer level, and special tax breaks. Typically, a nonsalaried worker has to provide these benefits himself, and if he's self- employed, he'll also be paying full social security taxes, whereas employees only pay half (the employer pays the other half). It's therefore not easy to compare income between salaried and nonsalaried work. Furthermore, it's not easy to evaluate the value of such benefits.</p>
    
    <p> For example, there are people who work almost exclusively for the benefits part of the compensation because they need their benefits to pay for drug treatments.
Conversely, others get over-covered--for example, employees without children have no use for the free daycare services, yet it's part of their compensation package.
The upside of nonsalaried work is often a greater deal of control over one's time. This means that if the goal is to pursue some form of intermittent work (see Intermittent work) interspersed with longer periods of nonwork, nonsalaried work is superior.</p>
    
    <p> Some jobs are location- independent, such as anything that involves information, and some jobs--for example, contractors--are so ubiquitous that they are de facto location- independent. Conversely, some jobs, like accounting, law, and medicine, are regionally licensed and, say a dentist who is capable of treating people in country A will probably not legally be able to set up shop in country B.
Since nonsalaried work is compensated per effort, it may be possible to put in supreme amounts of effort and end up with a very high total compensation by working around the clock.106 This could significantly speed up the accumulation of savings.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, it may be difficult to find sufficient work or sufficient energy to put in that much effort, since measurable work is often directly taxing of physical or mental energy.
Making money work for you Until I was 25, it never occurred to me that money could work for me.
Certainly I was aware that money could be invested, and in return I'd get a fraction of it back each year in the form of interest or dividends. What hadn't occurred to me was that this money could reach a level equivalent to my expenses and that this money could then pay for things just as well as earned income does.</p>
    
    <p> I think many share this same mental block, because savings accounts are either very small, so the annual payout may pay for a night out on the town, or because savings are cordoned off in retirement accounts where the payouts go right back into savings. This prevents people from thinking about capital income, just as taking income taxes directly out of earnings before the paycheck is received prevents people from thinking about taxes, other than as an abstraction that's out of their control.
If you decide to make money work for you, over time you'll become very familiar with the tax law, how to get money out of retirement accounts while paying as little penalty as possible, and how to take care of the principal and keep the yield sustainable, to the point of being at least competent (see Gauging mastery). Again, individual plans will vary significantly, but the guiding principles will be quite similar.</p>
    
    <p> The rest of this chapter will therefore discuss overall principles which should hold for the next 100 years, rather than specific investment plans, which may change within a decade.
Important financial ratios Within the field of personal finance there is a lot of discussion about salaries, net worths, and what one's "number" (savings needed to retire) is.
However, when analyzing the financial status of different people, it makes more sense to look at ratios than absolute numbers to see how well someone is doing. This is no different than analyzing financial statements of different-sized companies by dividing by equity, earnings, assets, etc.</p>
    
    <p>Â or by gauging the strength of a person relative to his bodyweight rather than his absolute strength.
Emergency funds Let's divide the income stream from working into spending on wants,
spending on needs, and saving. For example, a typically recommended savings rate for the average consumer is 10%. The division between needs and wants depends on personal circumstances.</p>
    
    <p> Most need far less than they think, but let us assume that 60% is spent on needs and 30% is spent on wants. As a general rule, emergency funds only need to replace needs. With the numbers given above, it thus takes 6 months to build an emergency fund that will supply all needs for 1 month. If the emergency (lack of job income) lasts more than 1 month, one will be wiped out and start to default.</p>
