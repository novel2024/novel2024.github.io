    <p> Here the function of shared attention is not so much the expert instruction of a novice but rather the maintenance of a mutual store of information and impressions. We feel compelled to continuously monitor what our peers are paying attention to, and to direct our own attention to those same objects. (When the face of everyone on the street is turned skyward, we look up too.) In this way, our mental models of the world remain in sync with those of the people around us.</p>
    
    <p>
The common ground established by shared attention is especially crucial for teams working together to solve a problem. Studies of groups laboring on a shared task—from students programming a robot to surgeons performing an operation—show that the members of effective teams tend to synchronize their gaze, looking at the same areas at the same time. More of these “moments of joint attention” are associated with more successful outcomes. Research suggests that the ability to coordinate such moments can be acquired with practice.</p>
    
    <p> One study of physician teams performing surgery on a simulator found that the gaze of experienced surgeons overlapped at a rate of about 70 percent, while the gaze of novices overlapped only about 30 percent of the time. But effective collaborators aren’t always looking at the same place at the same time; rather,
they cycle between looking on their own, then looking together.
If attention is different when we experience it as a member of a group, so too is motivation. Common conceptualizations of motivation—such as “grit,” the notion popularized by University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth—are based on the assumption that engagement and persistence are individual matters, individually willed.</p>
    
    <p> What this understanding omits is that our willingness to persevere can be enhanced when our efforts are made on behalf of a group we care about. Membership in a group can be a potent source of motivation—if we feel a genuine sense of belonging to the group, and if our personal identity feels firmly tied to the group and its success. When these conditions are met, group membership acts as a form of intrinsic motivation: that is, our behavior becomes driven by factors internal to the task, such as the satisfaction we get from contributing to a collective effort, rather than by external rewards such as money or public recognition. And as psychologists have amply documented, intrinsic motivation is more powerful, more enduring,
and more easily maintained than the extrinsic sort; it leads us to experience the work as more enjoyable, and to perform it more capably.</p>
    
    <p>
Experiencing ourselves as part of a collective “we,” rather than as a singular “I,” changes the way we direct our focus and the way we allocate our energies— often in felicitous fashion. Yet so much in our every-man-for-himself society conspires against the creation of a robust sense of “we.” Our emphasis on individual achievement, and our neglect of group cohesion, means that we are failing to reap the rich benefits of shared attention and shared motivation. Even when groups do exist in name, they are often weak and dilute in their bonds.</p>
    
    <p>
Psychologists have found that groups differ widely on what they call “entitativity”—or, in a catchier formulation, their “groupiness.” Some portion of the time and effort we devote to cultivating our individual talents could more productively be spent on forming teams that are genuinely groupy.
In order to foster a sense of groupiness, there are a few deliberate steps we can take. First, people who need to think together should learn together—in person,
at the same time.</p>
    
    <p> The omnipresence of our digital devices can make it difficult to ensure that shared learning takes place, even among students gathered in a single classroom. Some years back, high school teacher Paul Barnwell realized that many of his students were physically present, but mentally absent, during class.
“They were pecking away at their smartphones under their desks, checking their Facebook feeds and texts,” recalls Barnwell, who teaches English at Fern Creek Traditional High School in Louisville, Kentucky.
Moreover, once he got their attention and directed them to engage in a group assignment, he discovered that his students didn’t know how to carry on an academic discussion.</p>
    
    <p> They were so used to the stutter-stop rhythm of asynchronous text exchanges that holding a substantive conversation in real time was an unfamiliar and unpracticed activity. (Notably, research has found that asynchronous communication—of the kind that is now common not only among teenagers but among adult professionals as well—reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of group work.) In a clever jujitsu move, Barnwell redirected his students’ use of technology: he asked them to record one another with their smartphones and then analyze their own and their partners’ conversational patterns. Before long, his students were holding lively class-wide conversations —thinking and acting more like a group, and reaping the cognitive benefits that only a group can generate.</p>
