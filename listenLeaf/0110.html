The process of dressing for form and function is well-known: layers.
The outer layer determines the form and contributes to the function. The rest of the layers are pure function. Layers allow for flexibility in activity level and inclement weather and they trap more air in cold climates--anyone feeling cold and wearing anything less than three layers, if not four, isn't trying hard enough.</p>
    
    <p>75 The inner layer should be sweat-transporting (quick drying). This typically means technical fibers like polypropylene or similar.
If you don't plan on sweating much or if evaporative cooling is actually desired, cotton is good. The midlayer should be sweat-absorbing and warming.</p>
    
    <p> The best material for this is wool; down if it is really cold and you can keep it dry; wool works fine wet. If you can't afford wool, you can also use fleece. Cotton will also do in a pinch. The outer layer should be water- and wind-proof.</p>
    
    <p> This combination provides the most comfortable combination. Waxed cotton is probably the most durable if you plan to keep your jacket for more than a decade, since it's easier to refurbish than using water-repellent chemicals on your technical jackets. Also consider that zippers do wear out and they are harder to replace than buttons, which anyone can replace. In sunny conditions, the clothes should be UV resistant (darker and tightly woven); in warm conditions, the clothes should be loose and allow air to pass and cool--don't ruin heat adaptation by switching on air conditioning; in cold conditions, the clothes should be tight, particularly at the sleeves and collar, much like the business suit mentioned earlier.</p>
    
    <p> Also consider that the radiative heating component is strong for dark colors and weak for light colors. Hence, darker winter jackets provide more heat but also greater volatility.
Instead of a growing collection of clothing, much of which is obsolete or not generally useful, what is needed is a strategy to increase the number of outfits while minimizing the number of individual items.
How to build a wardrobe To (re)build a wardrobe, take a piece of paper and list all your items of clothing, spreading the items out over the paper as in this figure: "Blue shirt with print," "Black jeans #1," "Black socks #1," "Red sweater," "Green sweater," etc.</p>
    
    <p> Now create one outfit by drawing lines, for example, "black jeans #1" to "black socks" to "blue shirt" forms a closed geometric shape (a triangle) and constitutes one outfit.
How to build a wardrobe (see text for details).
It will be easier to match colors, at least for a guy like me, if you just stick to black, navy, and grey. These colors go well with each other and almost everything else.</p>
    
    <p> Continue this exercise, but only connect things you'd be willing to wear or are in fact wearing regularly as per this list. At the end, you'll notice that some items connect to many other items. Those are the central pieces of your wardrobe. Other items, like that hideous sweater from Aunt Martha, are fairly unconnected.</p>
    
    <p> Yet other items have duplicates which serve the same function. The most efficient wardrobe is the one with the largest ratio of outfits to items of clothing.76 Add or remove items of clothing accordingly. You can use the methods in How to get rid of things to get rid of clothes.</p>
