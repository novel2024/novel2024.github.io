    <p> Now add on insurance (nobody is going to lend money on an uninsured house),
taxes, possible home association fees, and general maintenance, that's another 50% on top of the mortgage payments. This comprises a huge opportunity cost in foregone investment returns, which will be nonexistent.
Any retirement accounts will be cordoned off, and therefore, having no assets to speak of and no investment cash flow, the homeowner will be forced to pay for his house with wage income over the duration of the mortgage. Renting such a home is obviously not much wiser.</p>
    
    <p> Except during extreme bubbles (see Rent or own?), renting costs approximately the same as owning, since the owner passes along the costs.
Either buying or renting a home that is priced at several times your annual income is a huge financial mistake. No business, not any that lives long, would obtain long-term debt that exceeds 50% of their equity and spend it all on nonproductive overhead, yet homeowners consider debts exceeding their nonproductive equity by 400%, conservative.
Hence, a trophy house, or a trophy anything for that matter, is not very compatible with financial independence.</p>
    
    <p> Giving up the trophy house in exchange for financial independence can result in alienation from those who are heavily socialized to middle-class status symbols. However, there are significant subcultures in which you can easily find friends and partners who put less importance on curb appeal and one-hour commutes.
Therefore, there is a deliberate choice to make between financial independence and the standard house engineered to give the appearance of enhanced "socioeconomic status." You can have one or the other, but not both.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, living in something significantly more economically efficient, smaller and more conveniently located than what your peers are living in is key to financial independence.
For most people a home is basically only a place to sleep, eat, shower,
and keep stuff (see Things). Realize that you could choose between having an extra bedroom and having an extra $200 per month.68 It's quite possible that the marginal utility (see Building blocks and Sigmoids, logistic curves,
and the maximum power principle) of $200 is higher elsewhere in the budget.</p>
    
    <p>
To become financially independent of a $200/month expense requires investments between $60,000 and $80,000 (see Financial independence and investing). This is the so-called latt√© effect on a large scale, except that instead of a daily superfluous cup of luxury coffee, we are talking about a superfluous bed or bathroom that is rarely used. How many years will it take you to save this much more money?
I think that a good guideline per person for living arrangements is $200- 350/month/person or about 10-15% of your net salary. If anyone tries to convince you to spend more, they're trying to sell you into a lifetime of wage work (see this figure).</p>
    
    <p> In some places this buys more than in other places. As far as I'm concerned, the percentage is absolute. If I want to live in a "nicer place" it simply translates into a smaller place. For instance, in New York or San Francisco, this just about gets you a room in an apartment shared with 4 others.</p>
    
    <p> In other parts of the country, this figure will buy you an entire house.
When I started out in grad school, I was paying about $275/month for a small room with a sink. I shared the kitchen, toilets, and showers with 18 other people. This was close to the downtown area of one of the most expensive cities in the world.</p>
    
    <p> When I relocated for work, I moved into my very own apartment for $400/month. Then I moved into a house together with my future wife for $330/person/month. We then made the mistake of moving into a house at $700/person/month. That lasted a year with stagnating savings as a result.</p>
