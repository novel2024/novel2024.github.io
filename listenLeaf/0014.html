    <p> Giving up the current vision thus results in feelings of deprivation, and is, in a sense, a loss of faith and even identity. If,
however, you follow a different faith than "the Church of Shopping," then not partaking in the shopping ritual won't be a deprivation.
Dissatisfaction with the current situation may be high and the vision of an alternative may be high as well, but without a plan, this can only lead to frustration. There must be a strategy or at least a plan, and it must be practical.</p>
    
    <p> To get things done, it's much better to have a plan than to have passion, at least insofar as you act on it.
Finally, there is the issue of perceived cost. If the cost is too high,
change is not going to happen.
Changemongers thus have the following four variables to play with:
1.</p>
    
    <p> Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation.
2. Strengthen your vision of future situation.
3.</p>
    
    <p> Build a plan to get from the present to the future.
4. Lower the perceived cost of the plan.
Motivation depends on the individual too.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, I'm motivated by avoiding negative outcomes such as feeling bad. Others are motivated by striving for positive outcomes such as feeling good. I prefer to change instantly and radically. Others prefer to change slowly.</p>
    
    <p> I have written many of the suggestions in the following chapters in the spirit of changing away from something negative immediately. If you feel differently about change,
modify my approach to suit your personality accordingly.
The lock-in We have come to a point where spending money is one of the few recognizable signs of success. For instance, spending half an hour in a traffic jam getting from A to B in an expensive car is considered more successful than spending half an hour in a traffic jam getting from A to B in a cheap car.</p>
    
    <p> I'm not sure why that is. Even more puzzling, both of these is considered more successful than spending 25 minutes getting from A to B on a train or spending 20 minutes on a bicycle getting from A to B while passing cars in a traffic jam.
Similarly, it's considered more successful to sit on a couch in your home, if there is an additional unused couch in an additional unused room,
compared to a house with no unused couches or no unused rooms. In the real estate market, a house with a greater potential for unused rooms generally commands a higher price than a house with fewer but constantly used rooms.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps there is personal fulfillment to be had in cleaning and maintaining a larger home? Or perhaps the fulfillment comes from paying someone else to do it?
Many men spend as much time on manicured lawns as some women do on manicured nails. I'm not sure I completely understand the point of pouring drinking water on a lush green lawn--not to mention the sidewalks- -among the rolling brown hills where we live, when lawns are inedible and all the birds in the neighborhood seem to flock to our freely growing flowers, which don't need any watering. However, the homeowners association refers to naturally occurring vegetation as weeds; they think they know better than the birds.
Recently, much attention has been paid to great kitchens and great kitchen appliances, while less attention is paid to great cooking and great cooks, except those on TV.</p>
