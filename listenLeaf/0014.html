While many people will often use this term loosely in everyday conversation, the full extent of this manipulation method is something that can only be understood after acknowledging all facts about it.
  First things first: many manipulation methods, or social influence methods if you prefer, rely on particular approaches to achieve intended results. There is the approach of compliance where you make a subject do something without really caring about their underlying ideas or beliefs. Then there is the persuasion approach that seems to make someone do something by targeting their beliefs or attitudes.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, a manipulator might try to tell you that doing something will help you feel better or become more successful. In other words, they are trying to convince you to adopt a different attitude about yourself or your life. Lastly, there is an approach that is referred to as the propaganda method or education method if you like. This approach aims to get converts by showing them the error of their past ways and introducing them to better ways and beliefs.</p>
    
    <p> It’s similar to walking up to someone and showing them that everything they have ever believed in up until that point has been a lie, while making them think that you are the sole bearer of the ultimate truth. The reason why brainwashing is so powerful and difficult to undo is that it combines all three approaches. It is often near impossible to convince anyone that has been brainwashed that they are actually brainwashed.
In the modern world, brainwashing is a daily affair.</p>
    
    <p> The media is a particularly nasty culprit as far as brainwashing goes. Since time immemorial (or at least since the invention of the newspaper and television),
media houses have been in charge of disseminating information at their own discretion. The media decides which tone to set for various social, political,
and economic topics across the board. Television shows, TV personalities,
marketing departments, and glossy fashion magazines have time and again defined which beauty standards are acceptable and which ones are not.</p>
    
    <p> As a result, a great segment of society is left feeling as if they are not beautiful or worthy enough because the media said so.
Politicians and religious leaders are two other significant culprits as far as brainwashing goes. Many politicians are self-serving and would do anything to get ahead in the world of politics. They have mastered the art of brainwashing masses of people to get behind them because the greater the number of brainwashed supporters they have, the further they are likely to advance.</p>
    
    <p> Brainwashed supporters also do not ask for much accountability from their leaders. It is thanks to brainwashing that a whole lot of political leaders have managed to mobilize their followers to commit senseless crimes that a sane person of normal thought and conscience would not commit.
Religious leaders who brainwash their followers, on the other hand, are keen to surround themselves with people who can be easily controlled and who believe in the same things as the leaders themselves. Think about it--if you were a self-serving pseudo-religious leader yourself, you’d want to have a subservient congregation that did as it was told.</p>
    
    <p> The last thing you’d want is an outspoken crowd of people who question each and every sermon that you give. This is something that many questionable religious leaders have made a note of, much to the detriment of their followers. Perhaps some of the starkest reminders of effects of brainwashing in the religious spheres are the multiple mass suicides that have occurred, as congregants seek to reach for the afterlife at the instruction of their religious leaders.
One such example is the mass suicide of the followers of Heaven’s Gate religious group.</p>
    
    <p> Led by Marshall Applewhite, Heaven’s Gate group believed that their deaths would help them get on a spaceship that would take them to the other world. This belief was brought on by years of brainwashing by a man who believed himself to be Christ’s representative on Earth. Besides Heaven’s Gate, there have been numerous other incidences where groups of people have been convinced to take their lives because of one religious belief or another. Even when they are not convincing congregants to take their own lives, some religious leaders can brainwash their followers in other often harmful ways.</p>
