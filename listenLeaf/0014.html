    <p> “Don’t be so stupid, everyone knows what their heartbeat is!” “He had always been able to hear his heart, and she had never been able to hear hers,” Ainley observed in an interview, smiling at the memory. “They had been married for decades, but they had never talked of or even recognized this difference between them.” Though we may not notice such differences, they are real, and even visible to scientists using brain-scanning technology: the size and activity level of the brain’s interoceptive hub, the insula, vary among individuals and are correlated with their awareness of interoceptive sensations. How such differences arise in the first place is not yet known.</p>
    
    <p> All of us begin life with our interoceptive capacities already operating; interoceptive awareness continues to develop across childhood and adolescence. Differences in sensitivity to internal signals may be influenced by genetic factors, as well as by the environments in which we grow up, including the communications we receive from caregivers about how we should respond to our bodily prompts.
What we do know is that interoceptive awareness can be deliberately cultivated. A series of simple exercises can put us in touch with the messages emanating from within, giving us access to knowledge that we already possess but that is ordinarily excluded from consciousness—knowledge about ourselves,
about other people, and about the worlds through which we move.</p>
    
    <p> Once we establish contact with this informative internal source, we can make wise use of what it has to tell us: to make sounder decisions, for example; to respond more resiliently to challenges and setbacks; to savor more fully the intensity of our resiliently to challenges and setbacks; to savor more fully the intensity of our emotions while also managing them more skillfully; and to connect to others with more sensitivity and insight. The heart, and not the head, leads the way.
 TO UNDERSTAND HOW interoception can act as such a rich repository, it’s important to recognize that the world is full of far more information than our conscious minds can process. Fortunately, we are also able to collect and store the volumes of information we encounter on a non-conscious basis.</p>
    
    <p> As we proceed through each day, we are continuously apprehending and storing regularities in our experience, tagging them for future reference. Through this information-gathering and pattern-identifying process, we come to know things —but we’re typically not able to articulate the content of such knowledge or to ascertain just how we came to know it. This trove of data remains mostly under the surface of consciousness, and that’s usually a good thing. Its submerged status preserves our limited stores of attention and working memory for other uses.</p>
    
    <p>
A study led by cognitive scientist Pawel Lewicki demonstrates this process in microcosm. Participants in Lewicki’s experiment were directed to watch a computer screen on which a cross-shaped target would appear, then disappear,
then reappear in a new location; periodically they were asked to predict where the target would show up next. Over the course of several hours of exposure to the target’s movements, the participants’ predictions grew more and more accurate. They had figured out the pattern behind the target’s peregrinations.</p>
    
    <p> But they could not put this knowledge into words, even when the experimenters offered them money to do so. The subjects were not able to describe “anything even close to the real nature” of the pattern, Lewicki observes. The movements of the target operated according to a pattern too complex for the conscious mind to accommodate—but the capacious realm that lies below consciousness was more than roomy enough to contain it.
“Nonconscious information acquisition,” as Lewicki calls it, along with the ensuing application of such information, is happening in our lives all the time.</p>
    
    <p>
As we navigate a new situation, we’re scrolling through our mental archive of stored patterns from the past, checking for ones that apply to our current circumstances. We’re not aware that these searches are under way; as Lewicki observes, “The human cognitive system is not equipped to handle such tasks on the consciously controlled level.” He adds, “Our conscious thinking needs to rely on notes and flowcharts and lists of ‘if-then’ statements—or on computers —to do the same job which our non-consciously operating processing algorithms can do without external help, and instantly.” But—if our knowledge of these patterns is not conscious, how then can we make use of it? The answer is that, when a potentially relevant pattern is detected, it’s our interoceptive faculty that tips us off: with a shiver or a sigh, a quickening of the breath or a tensing of the muscles.</p>
    
    <p> The body is rung like a bell to alert us to this useful and otherwise inaccessible information. Though we typically think of the brain as telling the body what to do, just as much does the body guide the brain with an array of subtle nudges and prods. (One psychologist has called this guide our “somatic rudder.”) Researchers have even captured the body in mid-nudge, as it alerts its inhabitant to the appearance of a pattern that she may not have known she was looking for.</p>
