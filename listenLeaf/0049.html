We can do so by simply going outside. We don’t need to wait for perfect weather, or to find our way to some unspoiled wilderness; any form of nature,
under any conditions, will do. There is, however, an optimal attitudinal stance we can adopt: what researchers call “open monitoring,” or a curious, accepting,
nonjudgmental response to all we encounter. Dor Abrahamson, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests borrowing the technique of “soft gazing” from the traditional Chinese practice of meditative movement known as tai chi.</p>
    
    <p> When soft gazing was introduced at a workshop he organized on bringing mindfulness to education, Abrahamson reports that one participant immediately noticed how it departed from his usual mode. “There is hard looking-at,” the participant pointed out, “and there is the soft receiving of images.” The orientation we adopt when in nature is ideally one of such informal mindfulness. (For those intending to establish a more formal practice of meditation, research shows that doing so in nature makes the habit easier to implement and maintain.</p>
    
    <p>) When we seek psychological restoration outdoors, it’s best to leave our devices behind; research has found that using a smartphone while outside “substantially counteracts the attention enhancement effects” of being in nature.
One exception might be the use of an app like ReTUNE—an example of extended technology developed by University of Chicago psychologist Marc Berman and doctoral student Kathryn Schertz. (The name is an acronym that stands for Restoring Through Urban Nature Experience.) ReTUNE is like a conventional GPS system, but programmed with a different set of values: instead of providing its users with the speediest route, it offers them the path with the greatest number of trees, the largest proportion of flowers, the highest frequency of birdsong.</p>

Say a visitor to Chicago wants to walk from the university’s campus, in the city’s Hyde Park neighborhood, to Promontory Point, a peninsula that juts out into Lake Michigan. If she consulted Waze, the popular mapping app owned by Google, its recommended route would take a brisk twenty-eight minutes: three blocks north on South Blackstone Avenue, then a right on East 56th Street and a left onto South Shore Drive. It’s the most direct way to make the journey, but the experience would be one of glass and brick, concrete sidewalks and asphalt roads, honking cars and hurried commuters.
The same coordinates, entered into ReTUNE, would produce a markedly different suggested route: a stroll that begins in the Midway Plaisance, an urban oasis of green; then a ramble through Jackson Park, with its lush gardens and sparkling lagoons; emerging, finally, onto a path that runs alongside the shores of Lake Michigan, winding its way to Promontory Point.</p>
    
    <p> The trip would take a comparatively less efficient thirty-four minutes to complete, but our visitor would likely arrive at her destination clearer-headed and more relaxed.
There are values embedded in the technology we use, and as we scroll and tap we often unthinkingly adopt these priorities as our own. By extending technology with the thought-enhancing properties of nature, ReTUNE encourages us to question the elevation of efficiency above all other values,
including our own mental well-being. ReTUNE makes its own commitment clear: it’s not the speed of the journey, it’s what you see along the way.</p>
    
    <p>
 THE RETUNE APP assigns each potential route a “Restoration Score,” based on the presence of auditory and visual features that connote “naturalness.” Its co- inventor, Marc Berman, is one of a number of researchers working to answer the question: What makes nature natural? This investigation may seem befuddlingly circular—but if science could determine, at a granular level, precisely which features of nature work their effects on our bodies and brains, such information could be used to inform the design of buildings and landscapes that actively enhance their users’ mood, cognition, and health. Through close analysis of natural and man-made scenes, Berman and others have begun to compile a kind of taxonomy of naturalness.
Natural landscapes, they have found, feature less variation in hue than urban settings (that is, their colors range from green to yellow to brown to more green) and more “color saturation,” or pure, undiluted color.</p>
    
    <p> Natural environs also present the eye with fewer straight lines, and more curving shapes, than do urban ones. Finally, unlike man-made designs, in which edges tend to be spaced apart (think of a row of windows on the face of an office building), in natural vistas,
edges tend to cluster densely together (picture the overlapping edges of a tree’s many leaves). Applying these characteristics as a filter, Berman and his team have designed a computer model that can predict with 81 percent accuracy whether a given image depicts a scene that actual human beings have rated as highly natural. Other researchers have identified additional features that distinguish natural tableaux from their artificial counterparts: natural settings incorporate dynamic and diffuse light; gentle, often rhythmic movement; and muted sounds that repeat with variations, such as ocean waves or birdsong.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s not the case that nature is simpler or more elementary than man-made environments. Indeed, natural scenes tend to contain more visual information than do built ones—and this abundance of visual stimulation is a condition we humans crave. Roughly a third of the neurons in the brain’s cortex are dedicated to visual processing; it takes considerable visual novelty to satisfy our eyes’ voracious appetite. But balanced against this desire to explore is a desire to understand; we seek a sense of order as well as an impression of variety.</p>
