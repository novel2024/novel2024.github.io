    <p>31 Such a person is not just an employee, but an asset manager as well. This person would pay a steep price32 by outsourcing this to professionals without at least understanding the basics of money management himself. In fact, outsourcing is a financial decision that should not be made blindly.

Emotional Emotional awareness is necessary to align action and goals (see Contingency goal-setting) with personal values. Such authenticity is important to ensure long-term happiness, despite our culture making a virtue out of professionalism in which, for example, a pacifist works in the weapons industry or an environmentalist works for a company that sells bottled water. Having a firm relationship with one's personal values is also important in the short term. It allows one to make choices without being swayed by advertising and other manipulative methods.</p>
    
    <p> Our values are frequently manipulated. Choices will be made because they feel good or out of fear. In general, rich societies place a high value on luxuries (extreme wants) and safety, and most ideas can be sold if those values appear to be threatened.
One's values must be known accurately to determine the right lifestyle,
and they must be known precisely to make good choices that maximize personal utility (see Building blocks).</p>
    
    <p> Given a decision, an accurate understanding of values reveals whether the decision is good. Given two choices A and B, a precise evaluation makes it possible to choose between them. Without precision to determine the price, trading becomes inefficient.
In addition to internal emotional awareness, external emotional awareness is also important.</p>
    
    <p> Aligning action with values requires persistence, mental fortitude, an ability to handle stress, and a strong character. These attributes are all a consequence of agency--the supreme belief that you are in control of your own life, rather than the belief that your life is controlled by luck, destiny or powerful others.
Emotional goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to be able to appraise value in all matters to make sound decisions.
