    <p> The emergency fund is an attempt to hedge against all the liabilities in your life with a cash reserve. To establish the fund, spending must be reduced to divert money to savings as in this figure. Its size depends on a fair estimate of the current liabilities--that is,
money that needs to be spent until the lost wage can be replaced. Naturally,
this depends on duration, the likely reduced amount of spending, and the loss of the wage relative to other sources of income.</p>
    
    <p>
This shows how an emergency fund works. If wages are no longer forthcoming, the emergency fund can provide a temporary cash flow to continue spending.
The emergency fund is no different from normal savings used for presents, large purchases, etc. Savings are essentially delayed consumption.</p>
    
    <p>
The same goes for retirement savings, which are essentially a very big fund intended to last from retirement until death.
The cash flow when working more than one job. If each job can cover expenses, the diversification provides security. This may also be thought of as working one job and having multiple clients.</p>
    
    <p>
A person, particularly a nonsalaried working man, may have several sources of income, either in the form of multiple clients or serial contracts in which case the cash flow looks like this figure. Due to the unsteady nature of his income, the working man will likely rely on savings in between jobs. Since periods without work are a way of life, "emergency fund" is hardly the right term, but the principle is the same. Having more than one income stream provides more security due to diversification.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, a working man can go into debt as well, and a salary man can take on side jobs. The complete picture for many people will thus look more like this figure. This system is generally tightly coupled and complicated, but typically not complex. There are many books dedicated to decoupling by introducing buffers and simplifying the system, mostly by consolidating whatever serves the same function.</p>
    
    <p> For example, two bank accounts become one. Some subscribe to automating everything with automatic payments, etc. Others prefer to make each payment manually. I suppose this is like the difference between driving a manual and an automatic transmission.</p>
    
    <p> It really doesn't matter, and it's merely a question of personal preference, as long as you choose whatever you're comfortable with.
Personally, I prefer the manual option since it allows for more control,
which makes it easier to fix things when (not if) they go wrong.
More important, though, is the primary reason that so many complain that they're not "getting ahead," which is apparent from the figure. It's the loss of wage to waste and other people.</p>
    
    <p> This constitutes a lot of hard work for nothing, and it's the reason why so many, after decades of work, have so little to show for it.
A fairly common cash flow, albeit a bit simplified, since most people have multiple, different kinds of debts and savings, and ways of transferring the money between the accounts.
The previous chapters have mostly dealt with strategies for reducing this loss. It's perfectly possible to live well using those methods, and the strategies and tactics can either be used to simply prioritize resources--for example, spending on things that mean something to you, like vacations to the south pole, antique furniture, brand name educations, etc.</p>
