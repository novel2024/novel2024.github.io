    <p> For instance, he tortured animals. This is a typical warning sign that you might have a young psychopath on your hands. Kids who torture animals often go on to commit other heinous crimes later on. Many murderers and serial killers have a history of animal abuse in their past.</p>

What’s most notable about DeSalvo’s murders was that most of his victims were elderly and alone at the time of the attacks. While most people are capable of showing pity, mercy, and overall empathy on the elderly, DeSalvo was quite the opposite. He knew that this was a vulnerable group that could be easily subdued to fulfill his dark desires.
It is reported that DeSalvo had an extraordinary sex drive, which is another sign of a person that may be predisposed to psychopathic tendencies.</p>
    
    <p>
DeSalvo also liked to brag outrageously about his conquests, sexual and others. His tendency for exaggeration led some people to believe that he was not really the Boston Stranger even after he confessed to the killings.
Jeffrey Dahmer Jeffrey Dahmer was an American serial killer who was found guilty of the rape, murder, and dismemberment of seventeen boys between the period of 1978 to 1991. Dahmer’s crimes were too horrid that it is difficult to imagine that a human being actually committed them.</p>
    
    <p> Not only did he kill his victims, but he also performed necrophilia and cannibalism on their corpses.
Dahmer’s childhood was not any more eventful than the typical childhood of a kid growing up in America during his time. That being said, some sources intimate that Dahmer was ignored by his parents as an infant. A lack of attention and affection, and overall neglect can cause a kid to develop into a full-blown psychopath later on in his life.</p>
    
    <p> Dahmer’s mother had a myriad of issues that she had not worked through, and his father was unavailable most of the time. As a result, Dahmer was left to fend for himself and find ways to occupy his time.
Growing up, Dahmer was largely reserved. He, however, did have a reasonable number of friends that he could talk to and play with.</p>
    
    <p> His friends reported Dahmer having an interest in animals. That in itself would not be a problem if that’s all it was. Instead, the interest spiraled into something darker and sinister. As a child, Dahmer collected large insects and roadkill and went on to dismember this at his home or in the woods near his home.</p>
    
    <p>
This should have been his parents’ first sign that something was wrong, but reports have it that the parents were preoccupied with other matters that did not include nurturing their son.
Later on, as Dahmer’s fascination with animal carcasses and bones grew, he reached out to his father and asked to be taught how to bleach animal bones.
His father, happy that his otherwise reserved son was reaching out,
demonstrated the proper way to bleach bones. Dahmer would use this knowledge to clean the carcasses he continued to collect.</p>
    
    <p>
Dahmer was eighteen years old when he started targeting human victims.
His first victim was a young man by the name of Steven Hicks, who was a hitchhiker that he picked up and lured to his house on the pretext of enjoying some alcoholic drinks together. After this first murder, Dahmer dissected his victim’s body and buried it in a shallow grave in his yard. Then he continued to live his life as if nothing had happened--no guilt and no remorse.</p>
