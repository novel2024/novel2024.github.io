    <p> For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn't become a millionaire by winning $1 million.
He merely becomes a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who "deserves" $1 million. He keeps it by being the sort of person that does not risk it, or he loses it by engaging in risky business.</p>
    
    <p> In the latter case, he'll likely quickly reacquire the money by starting another business, though.
The statement that people end up where they deserve does not imply any moral judgment, nor does it imply any form of entitlement. In particular, it's not meant in the modern marketing sense, that people "deserve" anything they can imagine. Rather, it means that attitudes combined with actions lead to habits which, over time, tend to deliver certain deserved outcomes.</p>
    
    <p> The mathematical term for this property or statistical connection is ergodicity. In popular psychology, it's known by various other names such as positive thinking, synchronicity, and praying.
These concepts are often described as magical thinking because the new habitual actions which result from mentally focusing on a goal and the statistical connection with the actual outcome go unseen. This doesn't mean these methods don't work; they do, but not for the reasons their believers promote.</p>
    
    <p> However, understanding that they work due to the aggregate effect of many small but congruent actions, and using this understanding methodically, makes transitions more effective. As an aside, it's interesting to note that the popularity of these books and methods increase if they also make the untrue statement that you can have whatever you want merely by wishing for it to come true. This only holds during periods of prosperity, as "a rising tide lifts all boats." It is, therefore, not surprising that such books sell mainly during economic boom times.</p>
    
    <p> Yet while there is no physical connection between wishing for something and actually achieving it, there's no denying that by making something a priority and constantly thinking about it, you will influence your actions. There are two additional ingredients to this: First, you must pick the right actions; second, your vision must lead to a mission--that is, actions must be initiated. To give an example of the wrong way to go about it, imagine that your dream is to become a millionaire--a very common dream, to be sure. The wrong way to dream about the million dollars is obviously thinking about what you're going to spend the money on once you have it.</p>
    
    <p> If you dream like that for too long, soon you'll find yourself spending money you don't have yet,
rationalizing that it's okay, because you'll have it someday (many student loans are spent along this line of thinking). The right way is to realize that in order to become a millionaire, you must earn at least $1 million more than you spend. Your every thought should therefore be about how you can a) earn more money and b) spend less money. Since $1 million is a lot more than many people earn, the majority of your thoughts must revolve around how to earn more money rather than how to spend less.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, my dream was financial independence, which means that investment income safely covers expenses. Hence, I spent most of my time thinking about how I could a) lower my expenses and b) increase my investment income.
Hence, I didn't have a particular net worth in mind, nor did I think particularly hard about ways to make more money.
Agency Humans with an internal locus of control--the belief that they're in control and that they're the masters of their own destiny--possess agency.</p>
    
    <p>
Agency resists and reduces stress. Anyone who has been out in the world for a while and experienced a lot of different situations has a good idea of what is normal, and thus can describe a bad situation as what it is: simply a bad situation. Conversely, people with less agency and a belief that they are not in control of their destiny are more likely to be stressed and to suffer the associated health effects. Combined with self-confidence, agency is the attitude that any problem can be fixed, given enough resources in the form of time, effort, and determination.</p>
