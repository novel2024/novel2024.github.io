    <p> Gesture works to amplify the impact of speech: the sight of a speaker making gestures effectively captures listeners’ attention and directs it to the words being uttered.
(The sight of someone making motions that are not gestures—moving while carrying out a functional act, such as stirring a cup of coffee with a spoon—does not have the same attention-grabbing effect.) One of the brain regions roused to attention by the sight of gesture is the auditory cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing oral language. “Hand gestures appear to alert the auditory cortex that meaningful communication is occurring,” says Spencer Kelly, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Colgate University in New York.</p>
    
    <p>
When we make gestures as we explain a concept or tell a story, others better understand what we’re saying; our hand movements clarify, specify, and elaborate on our speech in ways that aid our audience’s comprehension. People are also more likely to remember what we’ve said when we deliver gestures along with our words. In one study, subjects who had watched a videotaped speech were 33 percent more likely to recall a point from the talk if it was accompanied by a gesture. This effect, detected immediately after the subjects viewed the recording, grew even more pronounced with the passage of time:
thirty minutes after watching the speech, subjects were more than 50 percent more likely to remember the gesture-accompanied points.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s just these benefits of observing gesture that should lead us to take a second step: seeking out educational resources, for ourselves and others, in which the instructor makes proficient use of physical movement. A number of studies have demonstrated that instructional videos that include gesture produce significantly more learning for the people who watch them: viewers direct their gaze more efficiently, pay more attention to essential information, and more readily transfer what they have learned to new situations. Videos that incorporate gesture seem to be especially helpful for those who begin with relatively little knowledge of the concept being covered; for all learners, the beneficial effect of gesture appears to be even stronger for video instruction than for live, in-person instruction.
Yet the most popular and widely viewed instructional videos available online largely fail to leverage the power of gesture, according to a team of psychologists from UCLA and California State University, Los Angeles.</p>
    
    <p> The researchers examined the top one hundred videos on YouTube devoted to explaining the concept of standard deviation, an important topic in the study of statistics. In 68 percent of these recordings, they report, the instructor’s hands were not even visible. In the remaining videos, instructors mostly used their hands to point or to make emphatic “beat” gestures. They employed symbolic gestures—the type of gesture that is especially helpful in conveying abstract concepts—in fewer than 10 percent of the videos reviewed.</p>
    
    <p>
The takeaway: When selecting instructional videos for ourselves or for our children or our students, we should look for those in which the teacher’s hands are visible and active. And if we ourselves are called upon to teach online—or even just to communicate via Zoom or another video-conferencing platform— we should make sure that others can see our moving hands. Research suggests that making these motions will improve our own performance: people who gesture as they teach on video, it’s been found, speak more fluently and articulately, make fewer mistakes, and present information in a more logical and intelligible fashion.
Enacting gestures has another, more indirect benefit: when others (children,
students, co-workers, employees) see us gesturing, they tend to make more hand motions themselves.</p>
    
    <p> But we need not wait for them to follow our example; we can explicitly encourage them to gesture. A simple request to “move your hands as you explain that” may be all it takes. For children in elementary school, for example, encouraging them to gesture as they work on math problems leads them to discover new problem-solving strategies—expressed first in their hand movements—and to learn more successfully the mathematical concept under study.
Another experiment, this one conducted with college students, found that those who were encouraged to gesture while solving spatial problems—such as rotating a mental object or visualizing the folding of a piece of paper—solved more of the problems correctly than students who were prohibited from gesturing, or even students who were allowed (but not encouraged) to move their hands.</p>
    
    <p> The gesturing students’ improved capacity for spatial thinking persisted into the solving of a second round of spatial problems during which they were not permitted to gesture. The spatial skills supported by their initial gestures had become “internalized,” the researchers suggest, and the internalized effects of gesturing on the students’ thinking carried over to a new and different set of spatial problems. Even adults, when asked to gesture more, respond by increasing their rate of gesture production (and consequently speak more fluently); when teachers are told about the importance of gesturing to student learning, and encouraged to make more gestures during instruction, their students make greater learning gains as a result.
Encouraging others to gesture may have surprisingly powerful effects—like helping to close achievement gaps.</p>
    
    <p> The disparity in spatial-thinking skills between males and females is the largest known cognitive gender difference. A study led by psychologists at the University of Chicago found that five-year-old boys were already better than girls the same age at solving spatial-thinking problems that involved mentally fitting shapes together to make a whole. Upon closer analysis, however, this disparity was revealed to be not a gender difference so much as a difference in the propensity to gesture: the more children gestured while executing the task, the better their performance—and boys tended to gesture far more than girls. While 27 percent of boys gestured on all eight problems, for example, only 3 percent of girls did; 23 percent of girls did not gesture at all, compared to only 6 percent of boys.</p>
