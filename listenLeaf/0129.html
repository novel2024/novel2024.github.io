    <p> Speaking of light crossings, a regular rider on a well-geared commuting or road bike (not a cruiser or a mountain bike) will easily be able to out-accelerate any car starting from a standstill when the green light changes--trucks in particular won't be able to catch up until at least after 100yards or so. A sedentary rider generally won't be able to do this. Doing so represents both a physiological challenge, a perceptive barrier, and to some extent a safety problem for beginners--get off the bike and use the crosswalk if in doubt.
Never ride across the crosswalk; it's illegal, dangerous, and annoying.</p>
    
    <p>
Riding an underpowered bike, or more accurately, riding a bike underpowered will decrease one's confidence as much as driving a significantly underpowered motorized vehicle.
If it's cold, move faster, or add a layer. Experienced people tend to start out underdressed, knowing exactly what their moving "comfort level" is.
Comfort can be achieved by moving faster or slower.</p>
    
    <p>
If it's warm, the problem becomes more difficult. It's very common to be "air-conditioned" to low heat tolerances. What happens is that air- conditioning makes sweat glands ineffective as they're never called into use.
This means that when moving outside in the hot air, more blood has to be directed away from the core and the muscles to cool the body.</p>
    
    <p> If the skin becomes flushed when exposed to warm temperatures, that is a sign of air- conditioned sweat glands that have been rendered ineffective. This leaves less blood for the muscles. In effect, living with air conditioning is like exercising after eating a big meal, in which case the blood would be around your stomach area. This effect can be dramatic.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, people who are used to training hard, but indoors in air conditioned buildings, run out of energy and oxygen very quickly if they have to repeat the feat outdoors in 30C (86F) or higher temperatures because their circulatory system simply isn't used to the extra load.
The best type of bicycle for commuting is probably a touring bike, as it goes fast, far, and carries a load. The ideal frame is steel. Steel is durable,
and unlike carbon, it doesn't fail catastrophically.</p>
    
    <p> If you're going to commute by bicycle, don't be afraid of spending a couple thousand or more on a bicycle. If you maintain it well, it will last you the rest of your life.
After all, most people spend more on their cars, which generally only last about a decade.
Services In a service economy, people pay other people to raise and teach their children, grow and cook their food, build and maintain their homes, make their clothes (you still get to pick your own unless you hire a personal stylist), etc.</p>
    
    <p>, mostly things that we could do ourselves.99 In return, we get to spend our time working at a job, doing the same thing most of the day. This arrangement follows from the economic law of comparative advantage,
which is supposed to make everybody better off economically. There are,
however, parts of life that are difficult to measure economically because there's no market for them.</p>
    
    <p> There is, for instance, no market that can price in the cost of happiness, yours and theirs, in not raising your own children.
Worse, this arrangement fixes an identical price for everybody. This is great for the accountant who gets paid $100 per hour, allowing him to purchase lots of services with only one hour's pay, and bad for the hairdresser who gets paid $10 per hour. It would make financial sense for the hairdresser to serve himself for any kind of service that has a higher hourly wage than what he is paid.</p>
