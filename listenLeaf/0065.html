 WHAT ARRANGEMENT of space could support this way of thinking and working?
A surprisingly apt model can be found in the one adopted by Jonas Salk and Louis Kahn: the monastery. In the popular imagination, monks are solitary,
hermit-like creatures—but historically they have lived within a communal setting that balanced time spent alone in study and contemplation with time spent with others in robust social interaction. Richard Irvine, an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge, explored this equilibrium in an ethnographic study he conducted at Downside Abbey, a Benedictine monastery in Somerset,
England, where the way of life has remained little changed for centuries.
In describing the abbey’s architecture, Irvine observes that the buildings reflect their inhabitants’ daily cycles of intense engagement and hushed withdrawal, accommodating communal spaces like the library, the refectory, the workshop, and the courtyard, as well as the monks’ solitary cells.</p>
    
    <p> The monastery even has its own version of the Infinite Corridor—in the form of the cloister, a long passageway that “serves as the key element of connection in the architecture of the monastery,” Irvine notes. “The cloister is a space of movement which facilitates frequent interpersonal encounter, as the monks pass through it regularly to reach the common areas of Abbey Church (where they attend six communal services a day) [and the] refectory (where they join together in silence to eat three meals a day).” Though organizational psychologists have only recently recognized its value,
the monks of Downside Abbey have been practicing intermittent collaboration for more than four hundred years. “While the monastery is the site of frequent interpersonal encounter, the importance of solitude is also structured into the timetable through the commitment to twice-daily private prayer, as well as the summum silentium (complete silence, sometimes referred to as ‘the great silence’) at the end of the day,” Irvine explains.</p>
    
    <p> This silence “restricts interaction and gives the monk opportunity to be alone.” (He notes that members of the community have available to them another way of ensuring intermittent interaction: they can pull up the hood of their vestment, “hence covering the ears and closing off part of the peripheral vision, thus [making them] less inclined to distraction from other people.”) The ancient arrangement of space in a monastery bears some resemblance to today’s “activity-based workspaces,” which nod to the human need for both social interaction and undisturbed solitude by providing dedicated areas for each:
a café-style meeting place, a soundproof study carrel with a door. Too often,
however, such offices still fail to provide their occupants with that most effective mental extension: a private space, persistent and therefore familiar, over which they have a sense of ownership and control.</p>
    
    <p> Such a space can generate benefits even beyond those we’ve already covered because they are so well positioned to meet two additional pressing human needs: the need to claim one’s own identity and the need to belong to a larger group. For this extension of mind by physical space, there can be no better model than the studiolo.
Recall the richly decorated walls of the study belonging to Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. They surrounded their occupant with visual reminders of who he was: an aesthete, a warrior, a scholar.</p>
    
    <p> There was the lute and the harp, the mace and the pair of spurs, the bound volume of Virgil. On display as well were symbols representing his membership in meaningful groups. Worked into the intricately inlaid paneling was the Montefeltro imprese —a kind of family crest—featuring an image of an ostrich holding an arrow in its beak; inscribed underneath the bird was a swaggering motto, rendered in German and first proclaimed by Federico’s grandfather: “Ich kann ein großes Eisen essen,” or “I can eat a big iron.” The walls also featured the emblem of the Order of the Garter, England’s highest chivalric order, awarded to Federico by King Edward IV.</p>
    
    <p>
Self-referential images and messages are not mere decorations—whether they’re built into the paneling of a duke’s splendidly outfitted retreat or tacked to the walls of an office worker’s cubicle. Research shows that in the presence of cues of identity and cues of affiliation, people perform better: they’re more motivated and more productive. The first of these are the tangible signs and signals we employ to support our self-conception: we’re the kind of person who likes cats, or rock climbing, or “Far Side” cartoons. We use our space to advertise our hobbies, to show off our awards and honors, to express an unexpected creative streak or a quirky sense of humor.</p>
    
    <p> Such displays may sometimes be aimed at informing other people of who we are (or who we’d like to be), but often they are intended for a more intimate audience: ourselves. For a study published in the Academy of Management Journal, researchers examined the workspaces of people holding a variety of jobs—from engineer to event planner, from creative director to real estate agent. The investigators found that about one-third of the personal tokens these professionals had incorporated into their workspaces were positioned so as to be visible only to their owners. Of the objects whose stated purpose for their owners was “reminding them of their goals and values,” 70 percent were placed out of sight of others.</p>
    
    <p>
Why would we need such reminders? While our sense of self may feel stable and solid, it is in fact quite fluid, dependent on external structure for its shape.
We can sense this truth when we travel to a foreign country. Everything around us is strange and unfamiliar, producing in us a dizzy sense of discombobulation.
This disorientation can be pleasurable, if exhausting, while on a holiday in a faraway land—but in our day-to-day lives, we need to cultivate a steady sense of identity in order to function effectively.</p>
