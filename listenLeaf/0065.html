    <p> If these in turn are treated heterotelically,
then eventually the underlying problem will become so large that the system fails catastrophically (stress -> burn out -> depression -> heart attack) or simply becomes unsolvable.
Conversely, the homeotelic response aims to fix the entire problem--that is, cure the disease. Naturally, this is the ideal approach, but it requires a wiser approach to the problem. An important part of the systems thinking approach is to continuously increase the number of different problems that the strategy aims to solve or the number of different goals that the strategy intends to meet.</p>
    
    <p>
A good strategy solves multiple problems at the same time!
Yet enormous amounts of resources in our society are aimed towards solving problems heterotelically. Sometimes the solution is the cause of a new problem, but thanks to short-term thinking, the focus is often on responding to problems rather than preventing them. Our culture seems to have an ongoing fascination with action, and "reaction" is ironically more visible than "proaction."43 To solve the problem, the cause of the problem must be understood.</p>
    
    <p>
However, this is difficult and often impossible! Often there isn't one single cause. The human brain seems to be almost incapable of dealing with problems that have multiple causes. For instance, what is the cause of a financial crisis? It usually has at least ten different causes, exactly because a crisis can be postponed by treating individual symptoms, after which the system collapses altogether; any reasonably intelligent person blaming just a few of the many causes probably has other motivations. To simplify problem-solving, it's paramount that problems remain "small, slow, and diversified.</p>
    
    <p>" This, of course, is anathema in a culture that prides itself on being bigger, faster, and more focused. Nevertheless, small, slow, and diversified must serve as a natural delimiter to remain on top of the situation. While this may not be understood by everybody else, it's fortunately possible to live a life based on this simple philosophy on your own, by not engaging in things that are beyond your comprehension and control.
Effect-mapping Having realized that it is impossible to do just one thing, it follows that any action or behavior has a number of positive or negative side effects or consequences.</p>
    
    <p> Here, each side effect corresponds to a dimension in the figure. If you take all your actions, which are now vectors in "goal-space" and add them, this will give a strong indication where in "goal-space" you are likely to end up (see Ergodicity and destiny).
This figure shows a complementary way of mapping out the consequences. For those familiar with "fish bone" diagrams, this is the reverse of one.</p>
    
    <p> The taken position is a zeroth-order effect and it has first- order effects. Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. Each effect also has second-order effects.</p>
    
    <p> Positive effects go over the line. Negative effects go under the line. It's difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect with a strong positive second- order effect is net positive. If this can't be determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here).</p>
    
    <p> Hopefully this won't be a problem and second-order effects can be ignored. However, sometimes second- and even third-order effects either add up or accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.
As a general rule, if adding up the side effects doesn't create a positive bias, then the entire goal structure should be reevaluated.
The goal is the horizontal line.</p>
