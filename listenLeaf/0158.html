    <p> Approximately 12% gets incinerated (plastic bottles), 33% gets recycled (metal, garden waste, etc.), and 55% ends up in a landfill.
Given normal consumer behavior, most department store contents end up in a landfill within a decade. Being compacted and anaerobic--think vacuum-packed--landfills are more like tombs than composting facilities.</p>
    
    <p> In a study conducted by University of Arizona researchers found 25-year-old still-recognizable hot dogs in a landfill. When future archaeologists dig through the remains of our civilization, one of the things they will find are the ceramics, since ceramics are very stable compounds. Some of the biggest and most solid ceramic objects in our landfills just happen to be toilet bowls. This may be our legacy, our equivalent to the statues on Easter Island.</p>

(7) Frogs are a leading pollution indicator and are becoming threatened by extinction at an alarming rate.
(8) On the other hand, there have been a few examples of the converse holding--if you buy your way into a top-ranked university, you can still succeed (make a lot of money) despite obvious lack of talent.
(9) This euphemism typically means that your career is on the line if you don't obey and take the "opportunity." (10) Visit the website of The Bureau of Labor Statistics for more data on consumer spending.</p>

(11) If you don't believe me, try to give someone that isn't close to you a present you either bought used or that you made yourself.
(12) govern, v. To control, restrain, retard, or regulate.
(13) Although they do increase efficiency in terms of productivity per time worked, as shown in the section on sigmoids.</p>

(14) J.Â Vanek, Time spent in housework, Scientific American, 231,5 (1975) 116-120 (15) As profit is desirable, at least to the owners, without whom the business would not exist in the first place, shifting these cash flows around in time has therefore created an entire industry, the financial service industry, which until the recent stock market crash comprised 20% of the entire US economy in terms of market capitalization and 40% of GDP at the peak. This means that 20% of the economy was dedicated to moving money from person A to person B while taking a cut to do so (see this figure in Financial cash flow cycles). Needless to say, if 20% of a country's effort is spent on rearranging cash flows rather than on actually producing goods and services, this effort had better result in at least 20% more productivity for the "real" economy.</p>

(16) For the economics geeks, the availability of credit increases the velocity of money, which makes money more available, and thus decreases its value relative to goods.
(17) Even greater distortions obtain if a debt-driven society interacts with a cash-based society. When the debt-driven society imports relatively cheap goods from the cash-driven society, it leads to overconsumption.
The debt--claims on future production--gets exported to the cash- driven society.</p>
    
    <p> The repayments make the debt-driven country poorer which reduces demand and thus acts as a restoring balance. The balancing and the occasional overshoot can be financially devastating,
though, particularly to the country in debt.
(18) A plane has three degrees, pitch -> up/down, yaw -> left/right, and roll -> clockwise/counterclockwise.
(19) It should be noted that a great amount of effort has gone into linearizing scientific work to make progress predictable and measurable.</p>
    
    <p> This has been achieved by using annual evaluations, a promotion system based on the quantity of publications, and milestones to force progress to occur in small incremental steps, thus making changes approximately linear. Science no longer progresses in the leaps and bounds of masters, but rather slowly and persistently through an army of methodically progressing journeymen. This approach to research eventually leads to the point where people know more and more about less and less, which basically means that the forest is lost amidst the detailed study of trees.
(20) Lately, salary men have realized the virtues of creating a buffer between their salaries and their obligations as layoffs have become more common.</p>
