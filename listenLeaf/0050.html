    <p> Nature meets both these needs, while artificial settings often err on one side or the other.
Built environs may be monotonous and under-stimulating: picture the unvarying glass and metal façades of many modern buildings, and the uniform rows of beige cubicles that fill many offices. Or they may be overwhelming and over- stimulating, a barrage of light and sound and motion: call to mind New York’s Times Square or Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing.
Nature is complex, it’s true, but its complexity is of a kind that our brains are readily able to process.</p>
    
    <p> When we’re surrounded by nature, we experience a high degree of “perceptual fluency,” notes Yannick Joye, a senior researcher at the ISM University of Management and Economics in Lithuania. Basking in such ease gives our brains a rest, Joye explains, and also makes us feel good; we react with positive emotion when information from our environment can be absorbed with little effort.
The perceptual fluency we experience in regard to nature emerges from the way the various elements of a natural vista interact with one another. Natural scenes are more coherent, lacking the jarring disjunctions common in man-made settings (a rococo building next to a garish billboard beside a severe modern sculpture).</p>
    
    <p> Natural scenes also offer more redundant information. The shape and color of a leaf or a hillside repeat again and again, a fact that facilitates the brain’s habit of making predictions. When in nature, we have a good sense from what we just looked at of what we will take in with the glance that follows— unlike in an urban setting, where we never know what we’ll come upon next.
“Natural environments are characterized by a deep degree of perceptual predictability and redundancy, whereas urban scenes tend to consist of perceptually divergent objects,” Joye notes.</p>
    
    <p> “These divergences compete for our visual attention and make urban scenes substantially less easy to grasp and process.” Fractals are one form of redundancy that has attracted particular attention from scientists. A fractal pattern is one in which the same motif is repeated at differing scales. Picture the frond of a fern, for example: each segment, from the largest at the base of the plant to the tiniest at its tip, is essentially the same shape.</p>
    
    <p> Such “self-similar” organization is found not only in plants but also in clouds and flames, sand dunes and mountain ranges, ocean waves and rock formations, the contours of coastlines and the gaps in tree canopies. All these phenomena are structured as forms built of smaller forms built of still smaller forms, an order underlying nature’s apparently casual disarray.
Fractal patterns are much more common in nature than in man-made environments. Moreover, nature’s fractals are of a distinctive kind.</p>
    
    <p>
Mathematicians rank fractal patterns according to their complexity on a scale from 0 to 3; fractals found in nature tend to fall in a middle range, with a value of between 1.3 and 1.5. Research shows that, when presented with computer- generated fractal patterns, people prefer mid-range fractals to those that are more or less complex.</p>
    
    <p> Studies have also demonstrated that looking at these patterns has a soothing effect on the human nervous system; measures of skin conductance reveal a dip in physiological arousal when subjects are shown mid- range fractals. Likewise, people whose brain activity is being recorded with EEG equipment enter a state that researchers call “wakefully relaxed”— simultaneously alert and at ease—when viewing fractals like those found in nature.
There is even evidence that our ability to think clearly and solve problems is enhanced by encounters with these nature-like fractals. Study participants asked to carry out information-search, map-reading, and location-judgment tasks within computerized “fractal landscapes” did so most efficiently and effectively when the complexity of the fractals fell within the middle range.</p>
    
    <p> Another experiment, led by Yannick Joye, required subjects to complete challenging puzzles during and after exposure to fractal patterns of varying complexity. They solved the puzzles most quickly, easily, and accurately when the fractals they saw had a structure similar to those found in nature. It seems that our brains are optimized to process the fractal characteristics of natural scenes; hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have “tuned” our perceptual faculties to the way visual information is structured in natural environments. We may not take conscious note of fractal patterns, but at a level deeper than awareness, these patterns reverberate.</p>
