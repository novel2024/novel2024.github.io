not be subject to emotional manipulation or engage in wishful, magical thinking, believing things are true because he would like them to be true--or worse, believing he can influence external events by thinking positively about them.

be able to patiently await a better solution and be willing to compromise and accept something that is close, but not exactly your ideal.
Social Modern societies have become an aggregation of individuals. The complex structures that hold people together have been delegated to the marketplace.</p>
    
    <p> Instead of having a network and knowing who can fix a problem, we just pick up the phonebook, call someone, and pay them to fix the problem. Unlike in the rest of the world, we have no social capital; only financial capital.
This lack of complex social structure has led to neighborhoods where each household has their own power mower that they use for 15 minutes a week to mow their postage stamp-sized lawn. Multiply this by practically every other activity that people now do alone and one realizes that the replacement of community requires a tremendous amount of resources.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, this is great for business, but a person with some skill in creating a community can save a lot of resources and generate a lot of utility by connecting with people.

Technical Thanks to specialization, the average person uses many more kinds of technology than he actually understands.</p>
    
    <p> This lack of understanding makes us unable to distinguish quality and allows marketing and slogans to influence purchases. As a result, people frequently end up with products and tools that are either less than optimal or just plain unsuitable. This leads to frustration and additional purchases, and allows the experts to charge more for what should be simple operations. In addition, technology often replaces what used to be considered a skill.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, some people no longer know how to boil an egg thanks to the invention of the automatic egg boiler. On top of that, consider how many other life skills have been lost during our transformation from craftsmen to technology users. Not only does this leave us without the ability to solve the simplest problem when something breaks down; it also leads to enormous dependence on experts and specialists, and thus on an income to pay for their services, completing the circle. It's commonly thought that independence is mainly achieved through a large income.</p>
    
    <p> Rather than working to establish such a large income, it can, however, just as easily be gained by acquiring skills instead.
Technical goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to have knowledge of the skills of different professions to be able to critically judge the services of professionals.
