This is why having a strategy is much preferred to having a plan. A web comprises and connects a person's thoughts, ideas, experiences, memories,
goals, values, desires, connections, assets, liabilities, predictions and expectations. Here, a larger inventory of the aforementioned means there's a greater variety of possible strategies and that any given plan becomes more flexible. Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring the tactics can result in "clueless manager syndrome.</p>
    
    <p>" Conversely, focusing solely on the knowledge of tactics or skills described in Human capital and necessary personal assets would only produce a person with a multitude of hobbies.
Only the combination of skills and coordination will unleash the creativity of an expert. Creative synthesis occurs when you're able to see principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model elsewhere.
With experience, you'll see that the number of such models in the world is actually quite limited.</p>
    
    <p> What this means is that any kind of human understanding is based on a small number of representations that are repeated over and over. Perhaps this is because humans are only capable of thinking in certain limited ways, so the same methods are discovered independently over and over by successful experts in different fields, or perhaps experts tend to borrow from each other, seeking inspiration elsewhere; it is probably a combination. This means that one doesn't need another 10,000 hours to become an expert in another field, even if it's only marginally related. It means that it's easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed.</p>

It's important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much more important than doing things right (good tactics). This is why this book is short on tactics and long on strategies. Strategy is about defining the end-goals. Tactics is about the means to those ends.</p>
    
    <p> One thing that was crucial in formulating the strategy towards a Renaissance life with financial independence was that the means be widely available. A strategy that relies on means that are impossible to replicate for most people, like inheriting $1 million, winning the lottery, being the rare inventor or author that actually gets his great ideas commercialized, being the first one in on a new technology, or simply riding a leveraged asset in a financial bubble and getting out at the right time, or relying on yet-to-exist communities or ways of life, are not very effective. For fear of repeating myself and boring the reader, the strategy is what is going to create success and it is to a large extent what separates successful people from unsuccessful people. The tactics, less so, as most are capable of good performance on the tactical level.</p>
    
    <p>
For progress, it's essential to base goals on a consistent strategy that guides individual tactics (see Ergodicity and destiny). There's more than one way to spin a strategic web and some ways are better than others. Given a capable and intelligent person or group of people, errors rarely originate in the execution of a plan, though the plan itself may fail. Instead, errors occur in the principles underlying the development of the plan.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore,
it's important to base a plan or a framework on the correct principles.
Consider again the different types in this figure. Each type is characterized by very different strategies. As indicated in the diagram, the Renaissance strategy is based on a combination of consilience--a specific way of weaving widely different tools and ideas together to solve complex problems--and resilience, which is based on the principles of modularity,
diversity, and slack (loosely coupled feedback processes).</p>
    
    <p> Resilience is the foundation of most behaviors observed in nature. After all, if they weren't resilient, they would be extinct. While not completely equivalent,
consilience shares a lot with typical businesses strategies which can be transferred to the individual sphere. Combining resilience and consilience defines the Renaissance man, and they will be used in A Renaissance lifestyle to form a complete strategy that will make a committed person financially independent in a handful of years.</p>
