    <p>" If you really enjoy being at the cutting edge, be a reviewer, a tester, or even a developer.
Similarly, there are a great number of people who must watch movies as soon as they come out or pay full price for CDs. Instead, lag the edge and watch movies at the dollar theater or wait for them be released on DVD-- even better, wait until they appear in the library or on TV. You'll see "new" movies at the latter sources as well64--that is, they'll be new to you, and the only difference will be in lagging the movie theaters by one to two years;
but you'll no longer be paying attention to that.</p>
    
    <p>Most curious is the phenomenon of the hyper-consumer, who effectively pays to continuously own new stuff, to avoid being seen sitting on last year's furniture, and the culture that goes along with that. The hyper-consumer has to get rid of last year's stuff somehow, which can be had at ex-depreciation costs for much less. This also goes for store inventory that did not sell in time: Last year's model has to be discounted even though it's effectively the same as the current one, because who would want to buy last year's model at the same price? If I have to get something new, like rollerskates, I just get last year's model. Last year's inventory is typically cleared at certain times of the year,
so keep an eye out and be ready to pick it up; it goes fast!
The "limit order" price book Oftentimes decisions are based on emotions, but until or unless you develop a sense of pleasure from not spending too much money or a sense of dread from parting with excessive money or getting anything worse than the best price, emotions are not the best decision instrument.</p>
    
    <p>
For grocery shopping and other regular purchases, use a maximum price ceiling which is the lowest price you have ever seen. Only buy at that point.
If memory doesn't serve well, use a notebook. It's easier to memorize a limited number of items commonly purchased.</p>
    
    <p> This method is very powerful, and if followed, will always result in buying things only on sale. I use it to guide what's for dinner--whatever's on sale. If you feel really motivated, plot prices on a weekly or monthly basis. This should prove quite revealing.</p>
    
    <p> Many things, from vegetables to clothing, vary consistently in price on an annual cycle.65 Follow this cycle.
How to make things When I ask people who fix their own cars or motorcycles how they learned where all the bits and parts go, I never get the answer I expect.
Apparently, they didn't take an evening class or community college course.</p>
    
    <p>
They were not even taught by their dad. Rather they got an engine that didn't work, then just tinkered intelligently with it until it did. In fact, it seems that a majority of people taking classes are just looking to get credentials for skills they already possess.
Thus, the biggest barrier to overcome is the perception that you need to be an expert or take classes in order to be able to make things.</p>
    
    <p> This is particularly problematic for white-collar workers with white-collar hobbies,
like computing, or no-collar hobbies, like watching TV. However, if you can tie a bowtie, you can easily learn to knit--I learned knitting from a web page. If you can print your name, you can learn how to solder--I learned it when I was eight years old--and make electronic gadgets or repair electric gadgets. Repairing broken electronics is much more difficult, which is a good reason to avoid electronic controls on most electromechanical devices.</p>
    
    <p>
If you can draw a straight line and follow instructions, you can build your own furniture. If you can put the cap back on a bottle, you can fix engines and mechanical items, as those are generally composed of fasteners and parts.
In fact, most things can be created or repaired with a combination of the right tools and parts.66 The challenge thus becomes one of sourcing tools and parts.</p>
