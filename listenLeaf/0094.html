    <p> Which card or cards must you turn over to see if the rule is being broken?” The puzzle, once so befuddling, now seems easily solved.
Some evolutionary psychologists have speculated that people do so much better on the social version of the Wason Selection Task because natural selection has furnished our brains with a dedicated “cheater-detection module,” specialized for the crucial task of spotting transgressors who are breaking the rules of the community. It’s more likely, however, that people so readily succeed at solving the puzzle in this form simply because it is social in nature, and we are past masters at thinking about social relations.
Indeed, scientists have theorized that we humans developed our oversized brains in order to deal with the complexity of our own social groups.</p>

“Now, where you sit in the cafeteria is crucial,” Janis explains, jabbing at the map in Cady’s hand. “Because you’ve got everybody there.” The camera pans over the groups gathered around their cafeteria tables as Janis catalogs them, in not quite politically correct fashion: “You’ve got your freshmen . .</p>
