When things look hopeless, I don’t give up.
Under pressure, I focus and think clearly.
I am not easily discouraged by failure.
 With their replies, his subjects sorted themselves into two distinct groups:
high resilience and low resilience.</p>
    
    <p> By their own accounts, when faced with adversity or challenge, the high-resilience group was likely to push on through to success, while members of the low-resilience group were more likely to struggle,
burn out, or give up. Paulus found an additional difference between the two groups: on average, the low-resilience individuals exhibited poor interoception,
as measured by the heartbeat detection test, while the high-resilience people possessed a keen sense of their internal world.
In order to explore such intriguing findings, Paulus has devised a protocol that exposes volunteers to a challenging internal experience as their brains are being scanned. Over the past decade, Paulus has administered this regimen, called the inspiratory breathing load task, to hundreds of people.</p>
    
    <p> One of the most famous of his guinea pigs is the champion swimmer Diana Nyad. A world-record holder in distance swimming, Nyad made history in 1975 by becoming the first woman to swim around Manhattan Island. Four decades later, at the age of sixty-four,
she set out to swim from Cuba to Florida. Nyad was a model of resilience as she battled fatigue, nausea, and potentially deadly jellyfish stings over the course of the 110-mile swim.</p>
    
    <p> She failed four times in the attempt before trying, and succeeding, in August 2013.
Later that same year she became a pioneer in another fashion, arriving at Paulus’s lab to be studied. Before climbing into an MRI machine, she was fitted with a nose clip, which prevented her from breathing through her nose, and with a tube that went into her mouth. At the end of the tube was a stopper.</p>
    
    <p> When the stopper was removed, it was possible for Nyad to breathe freely through the tube; when the stopper was inserted, only a very small amount of air could pass through.
Once inside the MRI chamber, Nyad was directed to look at a computer screen mounted in front of her eyes. When the screen turned blue, the breathing tube was left open; when the screen turned yellow, there was a 25 percent chance that the tube would be plugged, forcing Nyad to struggle for breath.
Observing the activity of Nyad’s brain under each condition allowed Paulus and his colleagues to investigate how she anticipated a stressor, how she responded to a stressor, and how she recovered from a stressor.</p>
    
    <p> While all this was going on,
Nyad was also responding to questions in a test of her cognitive ability. (Writing about the experience in her autobiography, Nyad commented, “Of course I’m competitive, so I wanted to score higher than anyone who’s ever had the MRI.”) The scan of Nyad’s brain revealed a distinctive response to this uncomfortable experience. Her insula mounted an intense anticipatory response before the stressor—when the screen turned yellow—but settled down to a state of relative quiescence during and after the stressor.</p>
    
    <p> As for the cognitive test, Nyad recalls Paulus showing her the results, presented as dots charted on a digitized graph:
“Clumped at the bottom are ordinary people, who did very poorly on the test during the periods of oxygen restriction and when they were anticipating the upcoming oxygen restriction,” she recounts. “Next were a group significantly above the control group, who did much better; these were the Marines. The next group was a big bump up from that: Navy SEALS. Then Dr.</p>
    
    <p> Paulus pointed high up to the right, almost off the computer screen. This, he said, is me.” Nyad is truly an outlier, but Paulus has found the same pattern in elite performers of all stripes. Astonishingly, putting these individuals through an extremely unpleasant interoceptive experience actually improves their cognitive performance.</p>
