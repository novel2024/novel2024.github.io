    <p> After all, they paid for it. It's not what you can do, it's what you can buy, which matters.
With student evaluations now determining the career path of young professors, and young professors determining the career opportunities of young students, professors and students have adopted a nonaggression pact:
Professors give entertaining and easy courses in exchange for good evaluations. This way, professors get tenure so that they can get back to publishing papers and writing grant proposals to bring in grant money.</p>
    
    <p> Such "soft money" is sometimes a substantial part of their salary, and often the reason they got hired in the first place and sometimes the only way they get to keep their job. Students get their degrees, and everybody is happy-- except those that came to learn and be challenged, and in many cases went deep into debt for the privilege. It's not so much the educational growth of the graduates that matters, or the teaching skills of the professors, as much as it's the image of the school, the imposing campus buildings, and the habits acquired from several years of following procedures, executing consistently, meeting deadlines and solving closed-end problems with limited degrees of freedom, statistically quantified into a single grade point average for convenient ranking and quick sorting.
In the grand scheme of things, the functional purpose of universities is thus to sort students into future vocations rather than the commonly believed purpose of broadening their horizons in a useful manner.</p>
    
    <p> Ask a college graduate when the last time was that they read a book from one end to the other; the answer may surprise and depress you. Despite this, it's possible for individual students to get a broad background in college. Smart,
if not street-smart, people abound. However, it will come at the cost of a high grade point average, as the student focuses too much on particular interesting subjects or courses which may not economically provide the optimal grade point return on student effort.</p>
    
    <p>
While college means different things to different people--whether it's a place for higher learning, a two-to-four-year binge party, or simply a brand name admission ticket required by the job market--the increasing demand for education and resulting higher cost mean that many students take on debt. Student loans are often considered an investment in one's future. What most students forget is that the only way that they can sell this asset is by working off their debt. Also, except for possibly MBA students, few people do a discounted cash flow analysis to verify that their "investment" actually has a sufficient internal rate of return.</p>
    
    <p> It's perhaps surprising that many trade schools have higher rates of internal returns than college educations.
They cost (much) less, have shorter times to graduation, and due to the overproduction of people with college degrees, the latter no longer bestows as much economic benefit compared to the trades as it used to. Despite this,
many young people keep believing that their best shot at a middle-class lifestyle is a college degree, just as the lower class spends almost 10% of their already limited income on lottery tickets to achieve their financial dreams. Yes, 10%!10 Career Most career people's lives are dominated by schedules and procedures.</p>

They get up at the same time every day. They take the same route to work and sit at the same desk and do the same things day-in and day-out for many years. At the end of the day, they go back along the same route. They have various chores and activities scheduled until they go to bed at the same time.</p>
    
    <p> Maybe they occasionally go to a restaurant, the movies, or a sports event. Weekends are like evenings--structured around chores that didn't get done during the week, like laundry, cleaning, and sleeping. Vacations are arranged in the same manner--if not taken between job transitions,
vacations are spent a few days here and there as people spend one day traveling and then frantically go around and try to see everything they want to see before they head back, exhausted. The reward for running on this treadmill occurs not through the satisfaction of doing a good job, but from the semimonthly paycheck.</p>
    
    <p>
Similarly, much effort goes into spending money. Money is spent as a reward for the drudgery, but also because people perceive that there's nothing better to do with it. Often, money is spent in the most inefficient way possible, by using credit cards, then making minimum payments, thus paying for the item twice over in interest alone. Enjoyment is often limited to buying things because there's no time to use them, since the buyer has to get back to work and earn more money.</p>
