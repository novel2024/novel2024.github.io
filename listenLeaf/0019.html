Brainwashers understand the importance of a support system; this is why they will go to great lengths to isolate their prey from the people who care about them. It is indeed true that there is strength in numbers, and this sort of strength is exactly what a brainwashing agent does not want their target to have.
Some people do not seem to have the skills that are required to go through life successfully. As a child, you are wholly dependent on your parents or guardians to keep you alive, at least to the best extent of their ability.</p>
    
    <p> As you grow older, you are required to venture out on your own and make the best of your life, to the best of your ability. Certain skills come in handy when you are on this journey to self-actualization. These skills include knowing how to handle decision-making, how to make money so that you can pay your way through the basic needs at least, proper care of your body,
maintaining a positive attitude, and even building a good, beneficial relationships. Some people, sometimes through no fault of their own, making it to adulthood without the necessary survival skills.</p>
    
    <p> When this happens, they look to others for survival. A person who does not know their way through life will follow the first person who seems to know the way. Look at it this way: if you were drowning in the deep end of the pool you would not care who threw in the life jacket; you’d take it and be forever grateful to this person. This sort of indebtedness and feeling of being rescued is what some brainwashed people experience when they finally get the ‘life jacket.</p>
    
    <p>’ What they do not know is that what seems like a life jacket is actually a trap to keep them floating in waters riddled with falsehoods.
The type of family set up that one is exposed to may also make one more vulnerable to brainwashing. This could be argued in two ways. First, a child that is neglected will often gravitate towards the first person that shows interest in them.</p>
    
    <p> After all, they are used to getting scraps and will do anything for a full meal, so to speak. Secondly, if a child grows up in a family that is eccentric in their beliefs and behaviors that a child is at a high risk of being brainwashed. After all, they have grown up experiencing things that are outside of the norm--what is one more thing?
Persons who are living in difficult socioeconomic conditions are also at high risk for brainwashing. A person that can barely afford a meal a day is often not in the best frame of mind to choose well for themselves.</p>
    
    <p> On top of this,
the promise of a better life may be used to entice them into a belief system of the brainwasher’s choice. Some extremist groups, for instance, have been known to recruit youths from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with the promise of economic rewards and recognition. For a young person who is used to being invisible economically and otherwise such a reward is worth all the misinformation that they may be subjected to, albeit unknowingly.
Protecting Yourself Against Brainwashers Predators who are looking to control your mind walk the same streets that you do and probably live on your block as well.</p>
    
    <p> While some attempts at brainwashing may be apparent and easy to detect, others are more subtle. As such, it is possible to be sucked into the process while unaware. The important thing is to remain alert to any signs of abuse and manipulation and always to second-guess everything that you hear. In short, go through life with the proverbial pinch of salt to season all the information that is shared with you.</p>
    
    <p> Besides having a healthy dose of skepticism, there are other ways that you can protect yourself.
Remain aware of your vulnerabilities However smart you may think yourself to be, always remember that the mind is prone to making mistakes in the way it processes things. Once in a while, your mind might get sloppy and make you vulnerable to being controlled by external forces. Remember also to watch out for the people who matter in your life who are especially vulnerable on the basis of how their minds work.</p>
