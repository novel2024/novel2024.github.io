    <p> If you don't have a car, you don't need car insurance either. If you own your home outright, you don't need "home mortgage holder's" insurance. If your home comprises a substantial part of your assets (not a good idea), you would want to carry some form of insurance, as a loss would be catastrophic insofar as you would not be able or willing to save up the money to buy a new one in a few years.
Whether or not to insure should be a rational decision based on one's risk of loss and ability to survive the loss.</p>
    
    <p> Most of us don't insure our clothes or tools. For a financially independent person, this will extend much further since almost everything can be replaced many times over.
People Voluntarily stepping out of the consumer cycle and saving enough to replace one's job with investment income instead of working isn't "normal." The great majority of people do neither, and those who do one almost never do the other.</p>
    
    <p> Anyone not consuming as much as possible tends to do so out of external necessity and thus doesn't have savings to invest. Anyone investing for income tends to have plenty of money and thus consumes at an average if not above average level. There are few doing both; most do neither.
To do both requires navigating four types of people (see this figure).</p>
    
    <p> As before, the types may overlap each other and should be thought of as archetypes. The popular consumer culture represents the dominant type.
Being surrounded by this culture around the clock makes adopting its values almost unavoidable. Indeed, you may have to deal with your "inner consumer" from time to time questioning you.</p>
    
    <p> This culture measures success in terms of status symbols like things owned or number of visits to exotic places, awards, job titles, etc. One's value is measured by salary--a marketing executive is more valuable than a schoolteacher--or what something costs. Often, new things are valued more than used things-- shrinkwrap in particular significantly increases perceived value. But popular opinion is only rational from its own internal perspective;
consuming for the sake of consumption.</p>
    
    <p>
By choosing not to strive for these things, those who do will feel judged or be led to question their choices. This is largely their problem to deal with, but it will also turn into your problem, insofar as you have to deal with concerned inquiries about your material comfort level or their trying to rationalize their choices. As noted above, you may ask yourself questions like, "Can I really be comfortable with only one bathroom? Don't I deserve two?" or, "If I can't identify with a job title, like assistant sales manager,
who am I really?" On the other hand, it is possible to find other people pursuing frugality or voluntary simplicity as well as people interested in investing. If you prefer to avoid confrontation, keep a low profile when it comes to this area of your life.</p>
    
    <p>102 Don't mention that you also happen to manage a six-figure portfolio to your "voluntary simplicity" friends and don't mention that you only have one bedroom to your investment friends unless you're prepared for the resulting discussion.
Spouses and significant others When writing and talking about this lifestyle, the most common lament I hear is that, "This would be a lot easier if I was single." Technically, this is not true: Due to economy of scale, two or more people working together towards homeotelic goals will always be better off than two people working separately (see Contingency goal-setting).
Today, society has reached a level of wealth that has made the economic benefit of living in a community or a tribe, and, to some extent, even a family, unnecessary.</p>
    
    <p> This is partly why there's a growing number of singles;
the economic inefficiency of, for example, two people having twice as many refrigerators than a couple, has become affordable. The main problem is therefore social. In fact, some people have told me outright that they could never live in a space as small as we do (currently two people in 289sqft) because they can't stand being in the same room as the person they married for extended periods of time, or they can't deal with the idea of their children playing in the same room they're in. I'm not making this up.</p>
