    <p> While researching and reporting The Power Broker, he was overwhelmed by the volume of information he had collected. “It was so big, so immense,” he has said. “I couldn’t figure out what to do with the material.” Caro’s books are too colossal to be held entirely in mind—even their author’s mind.</p>
    
    <p> Nor is the space of a typewritten page (Caro does not use a computer) nearly big enough to contain the full sweep of his storytelling. In order to complete these massive projects, Caro has to extend his thinking into physical space. One entire wall of his office on Manhattan’s Upper West Side is taken up by a cork board four feet high and ten feet wide; the board is covered with a detailed outline of Caro’s current work in progress, plotting its trajectory from beginning to end. (So thorough is Caro that he must know the last sentence of a book before he starts composing its first lines.</p>
    
    <p>) As he writes, the stretch of wall becomes another dimension in which to think.
“I can’t start writing a book until I’ve thought it through and can see it whole in my mind,” he told a visitor to his office. “So before I start writing, I boil the book down to three paragraphs, or two or one—that’s when it comes into view.
That process might take weeks.</p>
    
    <p> And then I turn those paragraphs into an outline of the whole book. That’s what you see up here on my wall now.” In another interview, Caro explained how the outline wall helps him stay in the zone. “I don’t want to stop while I’m writing, so I have to know where everything is,” he explained.</p>
    
    <p> “It’s hard for me to keep in the mood of the chapter I’m writing if I have to keep searching for files.” Out of necessity, Caro found his way to a mode of thinking and working that would not have been possible had he tried to keep his voluminous material entirely in his head. “When thought overwhelms the mind, the mind uses the world,” psychologist Barbara Tversky has observed. Once we recognize this possibility, we can deliberately shape the material worlds in which we learn and work to facilitate mental extension—to enhance “the cognitive congeniality of a space,” in the words of David Kirsh, a professor at the University of California,
San Diego.</p>
    
    <p>
To understand how this works, let’s take a closer look at what Caro’s wall is doing for his mind. On the most basic level, the author is using physical space to offload facts and ideas. He need not keep mentally aloft these pieces of information or the complex structure in which they are embedded; his posted outline holds them at the ready, granting him more mental resources to think about that same material. Keeping a thought in mind—while also doing things to and with that thought—is a cognitively taxing activity.</p>
    
    <p> We put part of this mental burden down when we delegate the representation of the information to physical space, something like jotting down a phone number instead of having to continually refresh its mental representation by repeating it under our breath.
Caro’s wall turns the mental “map” of his book into a stable external artifact.
This is the second way in which the cork board in Caro’s office extends his ability to think: looking it over, he can now see—far more clearly and concretely than if the map had remained inside his head—how his ideas relate to one another, how the many paths taken by his narrative twist and turn, diverge and converge. Although Caro tailored his longtime method to suit his particular style of working, the strategy he came up with is similar to one that has received substantial empirical support from psychology: an approach known as concept mapping.</p>
    
    <p> A concept map is a visual representation of facts and ideas, and of the relationships among them. It can take the form of a detailed outline, as in Robert Caro’s case, but it is often more graphic and schematic in form.
Research has revealed that the act of creating a concept map, on its own,
generates a number of cognitive benefits. It forces us to reflect on what we know, and to organize it into a coherent structure.</p>
