Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key tactic. Success is then redefined from accumulating and consuming the maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the maximum utility.
Having been raised on products, a key challenge for recovering consumers is to identify their actual core needs and wants. The reason that this can be challenging is that consumers are used to associating needs with products.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, it's hard to disassociate being free from headaches from taking headache pills or to disassociate losing weight from buying the "FatMaster 3000." Or to pick a simpler example: Imagine a dog needing to get onto a couch. The utility sought is the dog ending up on the couch, and there are many ways to achieve this before buying a dog ramp. If the dog can't jump or be lifted by a human, the dog needs something to step on.</p>
    
    <p>
That's the utility sought: something to step on, not necessarily a dog ramp.
Consider the ubiquitous box. A box can be used for storage. It can also be used to sit on or support other objects (aha!-moment47) or block a passage.</p>
    
    <p>
Ideally, a box could be used for many things at once, so that it takes up little space relative to its usefulness. For example, several storage boxes could be combined into a dog ramp (aha!). After being decommissioned, it could be cut up for firewood, unless it is made out of plastic, and its construction is simple, so you can make it yourself. Failing that, finding box-shaped containers is trivial.</p>
    
    <p>
A box, particularly a sturdy wooden box, has wide utility and would thus fit well into the web of goals way of thinking which was outlined in Contingency goal-setting. Most important, though, is that its wide utility exists mainly as a potential in your mind. A person with no imagination and few skills will only see the box as a container. Approach the world without prejudice, start seeing things for what they are and what they can be used for, not what you've been told they're intended for.</p>
    
    <p> To do this requires seeing utility from a fresh perspective. This is also called lateral thinking, a kind of thinking that improves with generalization and worsens with specialization, or out-of-the-box thinking, which really originates from having thought in many different kinds of boxes. In particular, it requires a shift in focus from products to components.
Construction methods Many rely on their connection to the market, through employment and purchasing, to satisfy most of their needs and wants.</p>
    
    <p> While this makes sense in some situations--for instance, building your own microwave oven from scratch would take a lot of time48--it makes less sense in many other cases (see A Renaissance lifestyle). In some cases, purchasing is even used to substitute, usually unsuccessfully, for other needs like recognition,
meaning in one's life, self-worth, and even using and doing things (recreational shopping). Using the market to satisfy every need is expensive because the market solution is generally not the optimal solution.
Often, consumer products come with superfluous frills (side effects) that don't provide the desired utility.</p>
    
    <p> Such products waste money and take up space and time. The challenge is thus to distinguish between the need (for example,  keeping warm) and the frills (for example,  keeping the entire house warm) and then find an efficient--that is, economical-solution (for example, wear warmer clothing, be physically active, invite people over) rather than buy an uneconomical product (for example, central heating).
One of the most important aspects of construction is often the most ignored:
good raw materials or building blocks.49 In retrospect, that some ignore the building blocks may not be so surprising when considering the discussion above.</p>
