    <p> If the building blocks are poorly chosen, constructing any kind of solution becomes that much harder. Choose the right building blocks using the guiding principles in Strategic principles.
Combining wholes/solutions/products out of parts allows for flexibility and substitutability (see this figure). Having a product that can't be separated into parts is bad.</p>
    
    <p> This is obvious when one of the functions on a gadget breaks. For instance, a modern desktop computer is typically built out of individual, mutually compatible parts which can be selected and replaced by the user. However, most modern electronics built after the introduction of the integrated circuit are problematic--complexity which is better outsourced--as it is impossible for nonexperts to understand what is going on.
Conversely,
mechanical,
electromechanical,
and thermomechanical (engines) objects built out of wood and metal are serviceable by intelligent users since their functionality is apparent by inspection.</p>
    
    <p> You can see what each part does and thus you can repair it if it breaks. Also, if a part breaks, a new one can be made. However, it your product relies on the 8086 chip (a widely used computer chip which first appeared in 1978), you may have a problem sourcing it these days and you definitely can't build your own--you are trapped.
Next, consider whether the something has multiple uses.</p>
    
    <p> Does it serve more than one purpose or can it serve alternate purposes? In particular, can it serve as one thing first and end up serving as another thing? A wooden spoon turns into firewood at the end of its serviceable life, for example.
Obviously, raw materials are closer to being able to serve multiple purposes, but even completed products can have multiple uses.
For example, a computer can act as a media center, whereas a media center (TV+stereo+cable box) can't act as a computer. This isn't strictly a technology issue.</p>
    
    <p> Can any given shirt in your wardrobe be combined with any given pair of pants and look good? In the kitchen, the chef's knife is probably the most versatile, after the spoon and the pot--unless you're a vegetarian, in which case a serrated utility knife is better, as it doesn't require sharpening, nor a cutting board. What are the optimal ways of putting solutions together to find the maximum range of use?
Turn the problem on its head by changing it. Instead of looking for ingredients (blocks) for recipes (instructions), look for recipes for ingredients. This is strongly facilitated by carrying many recipes--that is,
ways to accomplish something--in your head.</p>
    
    <p> This way, the complexity is internalized and becomes a design problem rather than being externalized as a logistical problem. For instance, when shopping for groceries, knowing many recipes by heart allows one to tailor what's for dinner to whichever loss leaders are on sale, rather than venturing out with a shopping list and having to buy single missing ingredients.
If you only have a hammer, the whole world becomes a nail--the most common hammer is in the shape of a credit card. The more myopic the focus on a particular method, the more difficult the solution, if and only if the focus is on the wrong method (and it can't be correct all the time, if you only have one).</p>
    
    <p> For example, when tackling an obstacle like a heavy weight, don't remain confined to seeking out ways to make the weight lighter. A different solution is to become stronger. Changing the focus is similar to changing the problem, except in the latter case the idea is to collect many similar methods; when changing the focus, the idea is to know many different methods.
Most wants are internal, so focusing internally and "doing without" is often a less complicated way to solve a problem as it mainly requires strength of character rather than skills or connections.</p>
    
    <p> Rendering wants superfluous requires little technical skill, but it does require motivation and self-discipline. Giving up wants can be as tough or easy as going on a diet,
giving up smoking, or changing other habits dependent on strength of character. However, doing without is often thought of as a sacrifice,
especially when strongly attached to material comforts. It's quickly realized (after about a month) that happiness does not stem from being surrounded by possessions, but that being surrounded by them is the result of an addictive habit.</p>
