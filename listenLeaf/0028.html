    <p> In the office, you can identify a field that you are passionate about and become the office guru of that field. For some people, this might be the field of Microsoft Excel or reporting. The guy who is known as the office Excel guru will have an easier time getting things from people because they already know he knows what he is talking about. He has also proven himself likable and useful by solving all their Excel problems, and his colleagues will want to pay him back somehow.</p>
    
    <p> You do not have to learn Excel to make your mark in the world. There are numerous other fields that you can excel in and present yourself as an authority figure.
The Principle of Scarcity In economics, the laws of demand and supply are simple and straightforward: when supply is low and demand is high, prices go up. To translate this, scarcity builds value.</p>
    
    <p> If you are a businessperson looking to convince people to buy your product or service, it helps to highlight the fact that the product is on offer for only a limited amount of time. Further, let your customers know that they stand to lose out significantly if they do not access this product on time. When the marketing message is packaged that way, they will be more people rushing to beat the time limitation on your product.
In the world of business and personal relationships, it is important to become a scarce product yourself.</p>
    
    <p> If you are always available to everyone every time they need you, you will quickly lose your value. You have got to learn the art of being inaccessible and unavailable if you wish to retain your air of mystery and influence around you. When you do finally show up,
your word will be revered more than the word of a person that is constantly showing up and talking themselves out of any relevance and value.
The Principle of Consensus In everyday interactions, people look to others who are similar to them for cues on what to do or say.</p>
    
    <p> A person that is a good influencer understands that all it takes is one person to buy into their idea, and the entire crowd will. There are various ways in which you can apply the principle of consensus to your benefit. In an office setting, for instance, you can get a section of the employees to agree to a cause and champion that cause to their colleagues. These colleagues are more likely to be convinced that the cause is worthy because their peers said so.</p>

If you have ever bought anything from Amazon, you may have seen that they include a section that shows the other items bought by customers who ordered the product that you have just purchased. Why do you think this is so, and what effect does that section have on you as a buyer? More often than not, you will likely consider buying those other items because these customers who obviously have similar tastes and needs to yours bought it.
You may not have originally planned to purchase the additional items, but just the fact that others did it will have you thinking that you need to as well. This is the principle of consensus in effect.</p>
