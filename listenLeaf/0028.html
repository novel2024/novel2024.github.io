Savings and investments When credit and consumer financing is widely available, the personal savings rate is close to zero. Few really want to save when they can count on credit cards for large purchases or to carry them over in case of a job loss. As such, interest works in reverse. Rather than saving up money and receiving interest along the way before spending it on a purchase, credit is used to make the purchase immediately.</p>
    
    <p> Over time, the debt is paid off,
along with interest, until the payments are sufficiently low that one can go into debt again. This inverted sawtooth pattern happens on several different time-scales, the longest being the mortgage, with shorter time-scales for car loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit, with credit card loans being the shortest. Often, the latter are rolled over and thus constitute a permanent drain on one's earnings. Naturally, this is an inefficient and costly way to handle one's personal finances.</p>
    
    <p>
It's risky too. First, if new loans are the only way to raise cash, because all existing income goes towards bills and cost of living, and new loans are not available because credit has been maxed out, then a sudden need for cash--for example, to fix a leaky roof, or any other emergency--is a serious problem. It can typically be solved, but only at very high interest rates.
Sometimes interest rates are capped by usury laws, thus preventing a legal market solution.</p>
    
    <p> Second, paying off the loans typically requires steady monthly payments. If the debtor misses a payment, perhaps due to a temporary job loss or the aforementioned emergency, interest rates may be raised substantially, or the lender may repossess collateral. To prevent this,
people either spend money taking out insurance against such a situation,
either with the bank and credit card companies themselves or with third- party insurance agents. Self-insuring by keeping a number of months of expenses in a savings account, which people with jobs, debt, bills, and other financial obligations call an emergency fund, is becoming an increasingly popular alternative.</p>
    
    <p>
Other common reasons to save include down payments on a house, car,
vacation, education, or health. These expenditures can't be financed because they're unsecured or because the lender requires the down payment as a demonstration of financial responsibility. Naturally, other lenders are often willing to step in to finance the down payment at higher interest rates, thus eliminating the risk control of the primary lender's requirement for a down payment. Retirement for those who are too old to work and take care of themselves can't be financed by credit because of the difficulty in paying back the loan.</p>
    
    <p> Traditionally, those who are too old to take care of themselves have relied on having children and instilling a feeling of filial duty. However, those filial feelings are perhaps no longer as strong as they once were, with parents having sent their children off to institutions from a young age and only really interacted with them for a few hours a day, being busy with their careers and lawns. Children thus often prefer to send their parents to institutions of their own during old age, in turn.
Therefore it falls on institutions, in the form of the government and private companies, to provide for people during old age.</p>
    
    <p> The plans offered by private companies are either defined contribution plans, where the individual takes all the risk, or defined benefit plans, where the institution takes all the risk. In the latter case, the government is betting on the willingness of future taxpayers to pay a sufficient amount of taxes, and the companies are betting on the willingness of future customers to buy their products.
These plans are generally meshed with tax legislation, yielding tax benefits at the cost of losing access to the money until the officially sanctioned retirement age. This means that any such plan presumes that everybody will work until they're 60 to 70 years old, and that the tax- advantaged limits are set so that a majority of people will be able to save just about 10-20% of their earnings without losing the tax advantage.</p>
    
    <p> In turn, this means that workers need 30+ years on the job to gather enough to replace their working income with savings withdrawals (see Financial independence and investing). This also means that your typical financial planner will presume that everybody desires to work until they're 60 or 70 years old. Most importantly, it means everybody assumes that working until 60 or 70 is the only way to achieve retirement. With this frame of mind, it's not surprising that retiring at 50 is still considered early, despite the modern possibility of retiring decades earlier.</p>
