    <p>..at the rate of inflation!
Despite ups and down and bubbles and crashes, the rate of inflation is the long-term trend. This makes sense, because houses are nonproductive things.</p>
    
    <p> The reason people get rich in real estate is because regulations, or lack thereof, allow fantastic amounts of leverage which can be used during bubbles. However, if the principal asset is in the form of rental units and rents can be raised with inflation, inflation is taken care of. The withdrawal rate is then simply based on the average fill rate, say 80% or 4 out of 5 units, times the cash flow minus maintenance costs and taxes divided by the value of the units (also see Rent or own?).
In summary, the organic growth of any sector seems to concentrate around 3% real growth.</p>
    
    <p> This is the number I would use as a safe withdrawal rate. It's difficult to judge whether this number will be representative of the next 50-100 years. First, human population growth will peak out and probably decrease again within this period. The energy available from fossil fuels that underlies the economy will certainly reverse and decline as fast or faster than it has been growing.</p>
    
    <p> Maybe consumerism as a productivity engine will cease and people will begin to maintain their stuff or wear it out instead of buying new all the time, which would significantly reduce the need to produce. Conversely, historical interest rates dating back thousands of years, for example, as measured in repayment of a borrowed pig or borrowed grain at the next harvest, are easily as high as 100% per year. If I was a skilled pig or grain banker, I would happily assume higher rates, but for someone who just pays attention to money management issues for a couple hours every month or so, I would be comfortable with 3% for now.
The true cost of things This equation gives a quick way of estimating the assets required to be financially independent of a given recurring expense.</p>
    
    <p> Using a conservative rate of return of 3%, we find P0 = 1.03/0.03 p = 34.33 p.</p>
    
    <p> If the expense is given monthly, as many recurring expenses are, the annual cost is 12 times higher, hence P = (1+0.03/12)/(0.03/12) p = 401 p.
This means that each $1/month not spent is equivalent to reducing the required fund size by $401.</p>
    
    <p> For example, the cost of a $20 monthly payment may seem inexpensive to someone earning $15/hour, but with an asset-based income, it actually represents $20Ã—401 = $8020, which represents over 4 months of work at the given hourly rate. Thus, frequently it costs much less to pay more for a one-time expense than to get involved in a recurring expense. If, for example, the monthly cable bill is $40, the corresponding asset-based equivalent is $16,040. That amount can buy a lot of movies and computer games, and those can be leveraged into even more movies and games by swapping them (see Bartering and swapping).</p>
    
    <p>
Costs which aren't monthly can be derived from the depreciation schedule in Depreciation schedules and converted into the required asset backing using this equation.
So what should I invest in?
How would you like to manage your money? Do you prefer to do it yourself or outsource the job? Do you like accounting and reading reports or are you more interested in remodeling bathrooms and dealing with tenants? Maybe you're more interested in owning farmland for rent or windmills or solar panels producing electricity, a blog/blogging network, or other low-maintenance ventures? Until you know the answer to these questions, don't buy anything. Take time to figure out the answer while accumulating cash. If M in this equation is small, the strength of i, which depends on your investing skills, doesn't matter that much while saving.</p>
