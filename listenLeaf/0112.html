    <p> A load requires about a tablespoon of this mixture. If you want liquid detergent, simply mix with water and heat up the concoction.
Notice that the liquid version may form clumps. This is not a functional problem--just shake the container prior to use.</p>

To dry the clothes, use a clothesline. A clothesline is either a piece of string tied between two points or an expensive contraption available at "green living" outlets. If you stick with the piece of string, the clothesline will be working for you, rather than the other way around. Some consider hanging clothes up to be arduous, backbreaking labor involving about 50 deep knee bends from the hamper to the line.</p>
    
    <p> Avoid this (and the hamper) by putting the clothes directly on your shoulder (big items like pants and shirts) or in your hand (small items like socks and underwear). Then walk over to the line and transfer them either from the hand or the shoulder as you walk along the line. There's no reason to bother with pegs unless the wind is blowing strongly.
Health Think of health as wealth--the wealth that matters most--and being wealth, its usefulness lies in its ability to serve as an asset in our lives.</p>
    
    <p> The healthier the life, the better the life. What is health?
Consider the way a child feels about his body. He can't stay still and wants to jump around--almost can't help himself. How many adults do that?
Indeed, not many.</p>
    
    <p> Many adults act as if moving is not particularly enjoyable. Given the choice, they'd rather not move around. To them,
moving is uncomfortable, exhausting, and even painful.
Consider the curiosity of a child, always asking questions about this and that to learn about the world.</p>
    
    <p> Children express themselves creatively when given the chance. Here too, only a few adults are creative, imaginative,
lifelong learners. Those who are can't help themselves: They are mentally healthy and never bored. Learning comes easy to them.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, many have little imagination left and would prefer not to think, especially if they have to change their mind or break a few conventions to be able to think about something.
Consider that most parents love their children unconditionally and thus children enjoy unlimited social support. As the child grows up, the "innocence" soon wears off, though. Indeed, the current psychiatric and sociological paradigm defines social health as being adjusted to the prevailing norms and culture.</p>
    
    <p> After all, we're all cogs in the machine, and if a cog doesn't work, the prevailing dogma is that it must be sick and broken.
Why then is there so much depression and so many prescription drugs designed to make people stop caring so they can be neutrally "happy?"77 Instead, it makes sense to define social wealth as parallel to mental and physical health. As such, it should be measured by the strength of one's relationships to the people one chooses to associate with--one's tribe, so to speak.
Health is thus a condition of well-being and an ability to appreciate life.</p>
