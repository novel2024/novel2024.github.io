    <p> Balachandra found that participants who dined together while negotiating—at a restaurant, or over food brought into a conference room—generated 12 percent higher profits, on average, than those who bargained while not eating.
The explanation may go back, again, to synchrony. Balachandra notes that when we eat together, we end up mirroring one another’s movements: lifting the food to our mouths, chewing, swallowing. “This unconscious mimicking of each other may induce positive feelings towards both the other party and the matter under discussion,” she writes.</p>
    
    <p> Other research has found that the positive effect of shared meals on cooperation is heightened if participants dine “family style”— eating the same food, served from communal dishes. It may also be enhanced if very spicy entrees are on the menu, since consuming such food increases body temperature and perspiration, raises blood pressure, speeds up heart rate, and prompts the release of adrenaline, all hallmarks of physiological arousal. A group of Australian researchers reported greater economic cooperation among people who together had eaten bird’s eye chilies, a painfully hot pepper.
In addition to incorporating the now familiar factors of behavioral synchrony and physiological arousal, consuming food with others is in itself uniquely meaningful: our very survival depends on this elemental sharing of resources.</p>

“Eating together is a more intimate act than looking over an Excel spreadsheet together,” observes Kevin Kniffin, an assistant professor of management at Cornell University. “That intimacy spills back over into work.” In a study published in the journal Human Performance, Kniffin and his coauthors reported that teams of firefighters who eat their meals together perform better than firefighters who dine on their own. He believes that our focus on individual achievement—and individual rewards—leads us to overlook the performance- enhancing effects of group rituals.</p>
    
    <p> “Coworkers who eat together tend to perform at a higher level than their peers, yet cafeterias are often undervalued by companies,” he notes. And those tech companies that do offer luxurious cafeterias as a perk to their employees? The key may not be the freshness of the sushi or the deliciousness of the vegan grain bowls but whether the firm’s workers consume such delicacies together.
All of these approaches to generating groupiness are firmly grounded in our nature as embodied, situated, social beings; their effectiveness depends on people moving, talking, and working together, so closely that their brains and bodies fall into a joint rhythm. This marks a difference from notions such as “crowdsourcing” and the “hive mind,” which have enjoyed a sustained surge of popularity.</p>
    
    <p> In theory and in practice, these concepts are highly brainbound: a bunch of disembodied minds bouncing ideas around, usually online. Technology more generally has often served to isolate us from one another, sealing us within our individual digital bubbles. But this need not be the case; promising models of extended technology—that is, extended by the age-old resource of the human group—are now emerging.
For example: scientists at Germany’s Max Planck Institute and elsewhere are experimenting with automatic “rapport detection” within groups.</p>
    
    <p> Sensors embedded in a conference room or in video-conferencing equipment unobtrusively monitor group members’ nonverbal behavior (their facial expressions, hand motions, gaze direction, and so on); these data are analyzed in real time to yield a measure of how well a group is cooperating. When rapport falls below a critical level, nudges can be applied to move the group toward greater cohesion: the system might alert the group’s leader that a shared coffee break is in order, or it might suggest to him, via a pop-up message, that he engage in more mirroring of his co-workers. Inside wired-up “smart meeting rooms,” it may even elect to raise the temperature by a few degrees, or introduce some soothing white noise.
Another technology-assisted tactic for generating groupiness are activities in which members of a group are challenged to synchronize their movements while dancing with one another or moving in time to music.</p>
    
    <p> Body-worn sensors compute the degree of synchrony group members achieve, and real-time feedback allows participants to fine-tune their movements such that they become ever more closely matched to those of their peers. “We set out to design a mobile-based play experience that enhanced in-person social interaction and connection,” explains Katherine Isbister, a professor of computational media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who says she was inspired by research that shows “how being physically ‘in sync’ brings people together emotionally and builds trust.” Isbister notes that her game, called Yamove!, encourages looking not at a screen but at the other players. “The more players look at each other, the better results they achieve in coordination and the stronger the lingering positive social effects,” she says.</p>
    
    <p> Used as an icebreaker or team- building activity, games such as Yamove! may strike some as embarrassing or ridiculous. But unlike those we typically endure, these digital nudges in the direction of greater synchrony might actually work.
And—potential embarrassment aside—what’s striking about the group experiences explored here is how very positive they are. Military historian William McNeill entered “a state of generalized emotional exaltation” while marching with his fellow recruits in basic training.</p>
