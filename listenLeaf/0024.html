That such trickery is even possible only serves to underline the robustness of the connection between body and mind, the two-way flow of information that does so much to shape our daily decisions, our everyday efforts, our most intimate relationships. This link may also form the foundation of something even more fundamental: our sense of self. Among all their other functions, the steady flow of internal sensations we experience provides us with a sense of personal continuity. Thinkers have long mused on how it is that we can regard ourselves as unique and persistently existing entities.</p>
    
    <p> “What makes me the same person throughout my life, and a different person from you?” wondered the late philosopher Derek Parfit. Their answers have usually had something to do with the brain—with our thoughts or our memories. As the French philosopher René Descartes declared, “I think, therefore I am.” According to neuroanatomist and interoception expert A.</p>
    
    <p> D. Craig, it would be more accurate to say, “I feel, therefore I am.” Craig maintains that interoceptive awareness is the basis of the “material me,” the source of our most fundamental knowledge of ourselves. Because our hearts beat, because our lungs expand, because our muscles stretch and our organs rumble—and because all these sensations, unique to us, have carried on without interruption since the day of our birth—we know what it is to be one continuous self, to be ourselves and no other.</p>
    
    <p> Interoception, says Craig, is nothing less than “the feeling of being alive.” 2 Thinking with Movement DR. JEFF FIDLER is a radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
In the course of his professional duties, he regularly reviews fifteen thousand or more images a day—and he used to do so sitting down.</p>
    
    <p> Not anymore. These days Fidler walks as he looks, having set up a treadmill in front of the large screen that displays the radiological slides he is charged with examining. Within the first year of creating his “walking workstation,” Fidler lost twenty-five pounds—and, he felt convinced, he was doing a better job of identifying the abnormalities hidden in the X-ray images he scrutinized.
With a colleague, Fidler designed a study to test his hunch.</p>
    
    <p> Radiologists inspected a batch of images while seated, and while walking on a treadmill at one mile per hour. The participating physicians identified a total of 1,582 areas of concern in the slides, and rated 459 of these as posing potentially serious risks to the health of the patient. When they compared the “detection rates” they achieved while sitting and while moving, the results were clear: radiologists who remained seated spotted an average of 85 percent of the irregularities present in the images, while those who walked identified, on average, fully 99 percent of them.
Other evidence supports Fidler’s findings.</p>
    
    <p> A study conducted at the University of Maryland Medical Center, for example, found that radiologists reviewing images of patients’ lungs were more likely to identify potentially problematic nodules if they walked rather than sat as they worked. And a study conducted by physicians in the radiology department of the Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Virginia, found that radiologists who used a treadmill workstation did their work faster, with no loss of accuracy.
A different set of research findings helps to explain the radiologists’ results.
When we’re engaged in physical activity, our visual sense is sharpened,
especially with regard to stimuli appearing in the periphery of our gaze.</p>
    
    <p> This shift, which is also found in non-human animals, makes evolutionary sense: the visual system becomes more sensitive when we are actively exploring our environment. When our bodies are at rest—that is, sitting still in a chair—this heightened acuity is dialed down.
Such activity-induced alterations in the way we process visual information constitute just one example of how moving our bodies changes the way we think. Scientists have long known that overall physical fitness supports cognitive function; people who have fitter bodies generally have keener minds.</p>
