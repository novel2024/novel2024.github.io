    <p> For example, if you were to tell someone, do not go peeking into my room when I am away, that person is likely to interpret this subconsciously as, do go peeking into my room when I am away. This is probably the reason why there are so many exasperated parents of kids who seem to do the exact opposite of what they are told not to do.
As such, if you are looking to get someone to do something without being too direct about it, you can hypnotize their subconscious mind by using negative wording. Instead of telling your friend:
Please come over and help me pack up for my upcoming relocation.</p>
    
    <p>
Consider this:
You do not need to come over to help me pack.
Throughout the course of their day, your friend’s subconscious brain will be telling her that she needs to help you pack for your move because that is how the mind interpreted your statement. Of course, whether your friend actually comes over or not is a question of how much premium she places on your friendship.
Tip #5: Effective keywords Have you noticed how sales copy or advertisements often have this descriptive wording that gets you imagining all the possibilities presented by a particular product or service? Certain words hold a particular charm when it comes to hypnotizing people.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, when you tell a person to imagine something, you are already sending them into a hypnotic trance where they are attuned to their subconscious mind. When they are in this state, they are more suggestible and will likely do what you ask of them. If you do not believe this, go and look up any travel destination advert and have a listen. At the end of it, you will likely be thinking of booking your next vacation to that destination.</p>
    
    <p>
As long as the subconscious mind is imagining something, then it is getting programmed by that particular thing. This explains why some people are fearful of the dark--they have imagined the dark to contain bad things, and as long as that imagination is active, the fear remains real and present. It also explains why many people are afraid of horror movies. Think about it-- there is nothing scary about horror movies.</p>
    
    <p> They are just a bunch of normal people acting out fake scenes, so why do you feel so afraid? Because your mind has imagined everything to be real, that’s why.
Protecting Yourself Against Hypnosis The occasional self-hypnosis in the form of a captivating book or movie is always welcome. Once in a while, it helps to escape the harsh reality of everyday life. What might not be so welcome, however, is the hypnosis brought on by other sources that you are not too comfortable with.</p>
    
    <p> How do you protect yourself against the hypnosis that exists in your daily life? For a start, it is important to acknowledge that you really might not be able to escape all the hypnosis that is present in your life. It would be too big of a war to fight. That being said, there are certain battles that you can win as far as hypnosis goes.
One of the things that will help you to protect yourself against hypnosis is to live by principle.</p>
    
    <p> Living by principle does not mean being stuck-up or unrelenting when you should be flexible. It simply means knowing what you will accept and what you would rather forego, instead of simply going with the flow. If you are the sort of person that goes with the flow in the name of being easygoing, you might find that you have drifted too far from the safe shore. Manipulators who prey on others through hypnosis know to attack those who are not safely anchored onto something unshakeable.</p>
    
    <p> If you are the kind of person who upon being told to imagine how easier your life will be with product X rushes to buy product X unquestioningly, you will find yourself with a whole lot of clutter in your life. Having one or two principles about certain aspects of your life helps you to make more conscious decisions that are not influenced by the actions or words of other people.
There’s a wise person that once said that if you go looking for something you will find it. The reason why so many people are hypnotized in their daily lives is because they are not even looking for hypnosis so they cannot really spot it.</p>
