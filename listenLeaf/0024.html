In summary, the work system is designed so that most people have been specialized to as far down the production chain as possible. Specialization makes people replaceable either directly through advances in technology or through competition between many others with similar skills. Specialists are like cogs in the system and they tend to have very simple interfaces with it.
The pursuit of stuff, status, and happiness Our culture was founded on the idea that maximizing production equals maximizing happiness.</p>
    
    <p> In the past, pursuing this goal was admirable since any increase in production resulted in an increase in well-being: better food,
better medicine, better clothing, better housing, better work, and better living. At some point the focus changed from better to more: more food,
more medicine, more clothing, more bedrooms, more bathrooms, and more work. But can we honestly say this still results in better living and greater well-being?
The changing focus--from better to more--signaled the transition from a producer economy to a consumer economy. Whereas the biggest problem of the producer economy was how to produce and distribute enough goods to survive--a problem that still hasn't been solved on a global scale--the biggest problem of a consumer economy is how to clear the market of overproduced goods.</p>
    
    <p>
There are two ways to solve this problem: either produce less or increase consumption. Various strategies for working less, such as more vacation time and longer educations, decrease productivity.13 Yet, there are many more strategies for consuming more--government strategies as well as corporate strategies.
Government strategies, driven by the political currency of popular votes, comprise inflation-inducing monetary policies, which cause people to spend their money now rather than save it for later, and fiscal policies,
which promote government projects ranging from military expenditures and wars to job-creating projects, such as building bridges to nowhere, to direct stimulus packages for the consumers--formerly known as citizens.</p>
    
    <p>
Many profit-driven corporate strategies are based on fashion, planned obsolescence, unneeded upgrades, and masterful emotional manipulation -- marketing--causing people to continuously replace goods which are still in good working order.
Although these strategies seem to fail tactically in an almost predictable fashion, with booms and busts, recessions and depressions, or simply chronic mismanagement, when centrally regulated and directed, the strategies have proven immensely powerful on secular time scales. One result is that humanity has used up half of the oil--an ancient resource generated millions of years ago--within a span of a century, while measurably affecting the world's biosphere and climate. Since such resources are finite, these strategies can't be sustained.</p>
    
    <p> Economic growth-- how quickly resources are converted into consumer goods--is considered desirable by the economic profession, while biologists, psychologists, and sociologists are tallying up the losses. However, if individual companies measured growth in the same way--by generating income while ignoring that the income is generated by rapidly burning through their capital assets-- shareholders would be protesting. In a world where automation has eliminated pride in workmanship from the products and nobody has time for much else than work, status is based on acquisition and accumulation.
The purchase and consumption of products has become a surrogate for creating and doing.</p>
    
    <p> Self-worth and status, then, are not about intrinsic values such as who you are, what you can do, or what you know; they're about extrinsic values like what you can buy, the car you drive, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your home, and the price tags on your clothes. Witness the popular shows about highly stylized homes with a TV in every room--TV being a way of consuming your time rather than your money--expensive furniture, and art prints on the walls. Now go and look again, but pay attention to the number of books on the bookshelves, the tools for the hobby projects, the work in progress spread out on the desk.
There are none.</p>
    
    <p> What empty lives these people must live.
Having substituted consumption for creativity and technical skills,
shopping becomes a form of self-actualization--there's no small number of teenage girls who associate personal growth with changing their wardrobe-- "retail therapy" becomes an active way of feeling good. Shopping, then,
becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end. Rather than designing for yourself, purchasing professional designs or brand name- associated "lifestyles" becomes the preferred way of expressing who you are, and consumers start connecting with each other based on the things and brands they buy.</p>
    
    <p> Such consumption manifests itself in different ways.
For some, status-driven experiences are sought out. Rather than refining experiences, like learning to identify bird songs during a walk in the park,
new and more exorbitant experiences are sought out, and travel agencies are happy to offer them up. Many such trips resemble harried business trips rather than relaxing vacations.</p>
