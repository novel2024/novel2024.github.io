    <p> In a book published in 1984, the Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson advanced what he called the “biophilia hypothesis”: the notion that humans have an “innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes,” an “urge to affiliate with other forms of life.” This urge is powerful,
Wilson argued, and our thinking (as well as our health and well-being) suffers when it is suppressed, as it must be when we spend most of our time surrounded by inorganic forms and materials.</p>
    
    <p> Fortunately, he adds, an alternative path has already been mapped out for us: nature itself provides a comprehensive guide to the conditions in which our minds and bodies work best.
For example: We know that our brains thrive on the coherent organization and redundant information embedded in plant life—so why not bring the green stuff inside? That’s what the managers of Second Home, a network of co-working spaces in Europe, have done. More than a thousand plants fill the Second Home headquarters in London; when the space opened in 2014, E. O.</p>
    
    <p> Wilson was brought in to speak to the Second Home staff. “Everything we do at Second Home is inspired by nature and biophilia,” says Rohan Silva, one of Second Home’s cofounders. Silva adds that the Second Home office in Lisbon, Portugal,
was modeled on a greenhouse and is home to even more vegetation—more than two thousand plants, representing one hundred different varieties, including tillandsias, philodendrons, and monsteras. Research indicates that the presence of indoor plants does in fact improve employees’ attention and memory and increases their productivity levels; for students, too, a “green wall” in the classroom, sprouting living plants, has been shown to enhance their ability to focus.</p>

Greenery is only one part of nature’s bounty, of course, and practitioners of biophilic design have begun to incorporate other organic elements into new construction—of schools, office buildings, factories, and even skyscrapers. The fifty-five-story Bank of America Tower, completed in 2009, sits at the corner of Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan; when people arriving at the entrance reach for a door handle, what they feel is not steel or plastic but wood. “We wanted the first thing visitors touched to have a grain, an imprint of nature,” says Bill Browning, an environmental strategist who helped design the space. Inside the lobby, the natural theme continues: the ceilings are covered in bamboo, and the walls are constructed of stone in which the fossils of tiny shells and sea creatures are visible.</p>
    
    <p> Even the shape of the tower was inspired by nature; it emulates the fractal form of a quartz crystal.
Biophilic design is an emerging discipline, but a handful of studies have begun to suggest that working and learning in buildings inspired by nature can grant some of the same benefits for cognition as actually being outdoors. In a study published in 2018, for example, a group of researchers from Harvard’s T.
H.</p>
    
    <p> Chan School of Public Health asked participants to spend time in an indoor environment featuring biophilic elements (potted plants, a bamboo-wood floor,
windows with a view of greenery and a river) as well as an indoor environment lacking such elements (a windowless, carpeted, fluorescent-lit space).
Participants were outfitted with wearable sensors that monitored their blood pressure and their skin conductance; tests of mood and cognitive function were administered following each visit. After just five minutes in the biophilic surroundings, the subjects’ positive emotions increased, their blood pressure and skin conductance dropped, and their short-term memory improved by 14 percent over the level recorded following a visit to the non-biophilic environment.
It may not come as a surprise that the people in this study felt better in the space with windows: Who doesn’t prefer a glimpse of sun and sky to the sickly glow of fluorescent panels? Yet for decades, planners and builders believed that thinking happens best under even, unchanging light, shielded from the undesirable distractions and eye-straining glare ostensibly introduced by windows.</p>
    
    <p> These beliefs still shape the spaces in which we learn and work today —spaces that were often deliberately engineered to eliminate the natural variations in sunlight that we experience when outside. Such subtle shifts in illumination, we now know, help keep us alert and help regulate our biological clocks. Indeed, research shows that people who experience natural light during the day sleep better, feel more energetic, and are more physically active; one study found that employees exposed to daylight through windows in their offices sleep an average of forty-six minutes more per night than workers who labor in windowless spaces. The technology giant Google has determined that employees who have desks positioned near windows report being more creative and productive than do workers located farther away from sources of natural light.</p>
    
    <p>
The company has issued guidelines for how much daylight “Googlers” should be getting at work, and has asked some employees to wear light sensors around their necks to determine whether their workplace makes the grade.
In addition to brainbound notions about the ideal conditions for thinking, the buildings many of us occupy today were shaped by the energy crisis of the 1970s, when windows were commonly blocked or removed in the name of energy conservation. Today some educational and business leaders are recognizing the folly of depriving students and workers of natural light. At the H.</p>
