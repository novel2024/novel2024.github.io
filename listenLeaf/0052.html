    <p> Sadly, this point is entirely missed by our current educational system, or at least by the students who consider education to be a product and who stop learning as soon as they get their degree.
Education widens the focus while training narrows it.
Training teaches skills and methods. Aside from training in research and perhaps one vocation, learning more skills in depth isn't important, if the methods are restricted to one field (see The cost of specialization and this figure).</p>
    
    <p> Besides, in a book like this, it's impossible to cover all the skills of Human capital and necessary personal assets in detail. This would be training, and it's almost guaranteed that specific methods are going to be incompatible with the needs of specific readers, given all our individual circumstances. In addition, training creates contentment and a tendency not to seek answers outside traditional procedures. This is detrimental to you if you need to think for yourself, but a benefit to you if you need others to think for you.</p>
    
    <p> Education never provides simple answers. Fundamental principles, concepts, or structures are more important than technique,
because it is only possible to understand structures in the world if one has formed a corresponding structure in the mind. The more structures the mind has to draw on, the quicker it is at gaining an understanding of other subjects, as well as synthesizing new information, as the neural patterns in the brain are already in place (see Economic degrees of freedom).
For instance, in the sciences, a young, technically adept person will be able to quickly crunch numbers and manipulate equations, while perhaps not quite understanding the underlying concepts of his chosen specialization, whereas a more experienced person will quickly understand the underlying concepts of even unfamiliar subject areas.</p>
    
    <p> In physics and mathematics, such experienced people are said to have physical intuition or mathematical maturity, respectively.
Sadly, many educations focus more on technical details because they are more easily testable. Even without the need for testing, many authors and educators are guilty of obscuring the fundamentals by giving equal time to all pieces of information.33 Automatically grasping what is important only comes with experience.</p>
    
    <p>
Now, there are many ways of measuring experience, the most popular being tenure. However, working in the same place for five years does not imply five years of experience. If you've been doing exactly the same thing,
day in and day out for five years, and it only took a day to learn, you have one day's experience, five years over.
People remember most of what they do, some of what they say, but little of what they see or hear.</p>
    
    <p>34 It's therefore important to do things. You must experiment systematically to understand the underlying fundamental principle. In cooking, try to leave ingredients out or substitute in new ones to see what happens. In sports, practice unmastered techniques actively and put them together with other techniques.</p>
    
    <p> In finance, try investing in different things. Don't be afraid to try new things. Education also requires being open-minded. After learning a complicated subject, see if you can explain it to your mother35 or use it in an otherwise unrelated field.</p>
    
    <p> Only after doing that do you own the knowledge.
Gauging mastery There are several ways of measuring expertise and mastery. One common method is using tenure, for which there is a whole classification scheme that reflects relative competence fairly accurately.
