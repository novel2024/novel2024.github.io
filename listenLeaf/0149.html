    <p> To compensate for this, all possible periods from the past can be calculated. This is called a Monte Carlo simulation and there is one available at firecalc.com. Of course, this is only accurate if the future repeats the past numbers.</p>
    
    <p> Still, plotting for all possible historical periods shows how things have played out historically. This exercise can be repeated for different markets (domestic equity, international equity,
commodities, real estate, timber, etc.) and for different investment methods (buy and hold, dividends, Dogs of the Dow, etc.).</p>
    
    <p> It will, however, quickly become clear that there are limits to how much the model can be fitted to the data. The objective of this exercise isn't to get a numerical value, but to get a sense of possible future scenarios, assuming that the future will likely repeat the past in one way or another.
Numerical simulations require a lot of effort, so it's easier and more accurate to account for inflation and return rates by setting i to be the real rate of return, which equals the nominal rate of return minus inflation. Also,
consider that official inflation numbers may not necessarily pertain to you.</p>
    
    <p>
Consumer inflation is calculated based on what consumers buy and this will likely be quite different from what you buy.
Given this uncertainty, what is one to do? Accept that the worst that can happen is that your investments thoroughly collapse, which will likely mean the economy is dealing with mass unemployment or some other calamity.
This in turn means that whoever pays their expenses with work will also be in trouble. In particular, since they don't know how to live efficiently, they will be in bigger trouble than you are, since they need to find high-income jobs, whereas you have a much larger selection of low-income jobs.</p>
    
    <p> In such a disaster, you may be poor with a low income, but everybody else will be broke with no income.
As an investor I live with the fact that sometimes markets go down,
which makes me feel poorer, but also makes stocks cheaper to buy.
Sometimes they go up, which makes me feel rich, but also makes stocks more expensive to buy. We can calculate expectation values forever and ever, but they are just that--expectations.</p>
    
    <p> Nothing can be guaranteed.
Reaching financial independence and having your money work for you at an early point means projecting out 60 years. A lot can happen in 60 years,
including accidents that disable those who work for money, or technological changes that render entire industries (typewriters, telex machines, coach wagons, trolley cars, trans-Atlantic blimps, etc.) obsolete.</p>
    
    <p> However, it's likely that it'll still be possible to invest in some manner even 60 years from now. There's no telling whether those investments will be in the stock market, government debt, personal debt, annuities, mortgages, timber, real estate, plankton farms, cattle, potable water, topsoil, or what have you. It would be a big mistake to think that a choice made now will also be valid only 10 years from now, just as any particular investment vehicle I could suggest now will probably sound silly a decade from now. Thirty years ago everybody hated stocks but loved gold.</p>
    
    <p> Twenty years ago mutual funds were the hottest thing. Then after a decade of trending stock markets, which moved up no matter what people owned, it was decided that the managers weren't needed and index funds came into fashion--why do you need a manager if markets go up all on their own? At that point nobody wanted to own gold. In the past 10 years the market has been in a trading range and now gold is more expensive than ever, so who knows what the future will bring? My suggestion is not to presume that one can pick an asset class and then stick with it forever.
Despite this, there are a few established principles in the art of investing.</p>
