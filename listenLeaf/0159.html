(21) There is a tendency to declare the present the pinnacle of evolution,
but given that the idea of relying on so-called"human ingenuity" to solve problems is a few hundred years old, that industrialism, imported tea, and canned soup are more than 100 years old, and that it's a good 40 years since man last walked in the moon, I claim that from a secular, macro perspective, it has been a long time since anything radical has happened. In other words, if you took a person from the 19th century and transplanted them into the 21st century, the shift in culture would not be immense--only the change in technology would be.
(22) It is also interesting to observe that practically all the proposed solutions for the systemic problems caused by technology such as overpopulation, climate change, and pollution, are technological in nature.
(23) If you substitute kings with national governments, religion with the myth of progress and economic growth, and superstition with the widespread belief in technological fixes supplied by a small group of people, who are mostly unable to explain their knowledge to outsiders,
you'll see that this world was perhaps more similar than dissimilar to the modern world.</p>
    
    <p> While modern people believe in different things,
they believe in the same way as before and relate to their institutions in much the same way.
(24) When suggesting a direction for the future I think many authors make the mistake of envisioning a top-down approach to what society and the people in it should look and behave like--typically an idealized utopia that is perhaps subconsciously reflective of the author's values and ideas. However, if you accept that succession (see Succession and the cycle of change) describes how society evolves, it's clear that large-scale change comes about only once the system adapts to the new "species" of humans with different behaviors. Since the societal adaptation is slow, it's therefore clear that individuals who desire to change their life need a bottom-up approach, as they have to function within society's existing framework.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore an individual strategy that depends on a yet-to-exist world is of little use.
(25) A caveat for those planning to pioneer a new world-changing lifestyle,
though: It is worth keeping in mind that some pioneer ideas will eventually be leveraged and used to first control the masses until the masses understand and start gaming the rules, rather than following the original pioneering philosophy.
(26) Due to the explosive compound growth of the human population over the past couple centuries, there are now more scientists living today than the total number of scientists who have ever been born.
(27) Or at least we used to.</p>
    
    <p> I'm sure that someone with too much time on their hands has found a more politically correct word by now.
(28) Sometimes a "housewife" salary is calculated by summing up market rates for similar services; this may be one way to do it.
(29) See, for example, The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance by Ericsson et.Â al.</p>

(30) Currently buy and hold index investing and exchange-traded funds.
(31) Assuming that income > expenses!
(32) Typical prices are 1-2% of assets per year!
(33) I'm guilty as charged.
(34) Students and conference attendants take note!
(35) You do not understand quantum physics until you can explain it to your mother--presuming that she is not a physicist!
(36) For instance, boxing is not something you do, it is something you are (unfortunately the English language makes a distinction).</p>
    
    <p> This is an important distinction. You can't successfully do anything you are not.
If you are not a boxer, boxing is something you must practice to become a boxer.
(37) This began happening to me in my early 20s.</p>

(38) The leading term is a second-order tetration, that is, NN, where N is the number of degrees of freedom.
(39) It's interesting to note that meetings are often scheduled in 15-minute chunks for the simple reason that time management software divides the day into 15-minute chunks regardless of whether the content of the meetings takes, say, 10 minutes or 20 minutes.
(40) Within the university world, course requirements are sometimes tightly coupled in that students need course A, B, and C to take course D and they need A, B and D to take E. Now, if the student has a problem passing C, this can cause his entire major to fail.</p>

(41) Likely, this list will be trivial for some--at least it was for our grandparents--if so, don't worry--there'll be more challenges to come.
(42) For instance, I don't and will not own a printer. They break down all the time and are more trouble than they are worth. Also, I don't own certain investment vehicles because they're simply too complicated tax-wise.</p>
