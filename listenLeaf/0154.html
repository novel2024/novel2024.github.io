Staying with the progression of mastery, the next stage is comparing. A particularly poor (and popular) method at this stage is chasing yield, where people compare the returns of different investments (funds, stocks, etc.) and buy whatever has recently performed the best. Never do that! It is akin to shooting arrows into the location where a prey was hit a few hours ago.</p>
    
    <p>
The next level is compiling (again, see Gauging mastery). Here,
understanding is presented as fairly long lists of rules or tips about things that have worked well at one point or another. It's not yet understood why they have worked and it's difficult to choose one, plus the rules never seem to apply to a given investment all at the same time.
However, having compiled a list of rules, one may use a "screen" to filter companies and even to sort them.</p>
    
    <p> It's thus a simple matter to calculate,
say, the top ten of the list, the bottom ten, or top twenty on a combined list.
This takes emotion out of the game, and many quantitative systems work on this level. This takes some effort to set up, but once it is, it can run automatically.
Coordinating rules requires understanding why some rules work better than others and why some only work in certain situations.</p>
    
    <p> This is a value judgment and a complex problem which is mathematically intractable. Still,
even at this level you'll be competing with other investors who are likely using some of the same rules to form their strategies. The problem with these strategies is that the market is self-correcting and so opportunities disappear even as they are created. It's like a lake with a limited number of fishing spots.</p>
    
    <p> If people start showing up at the same particular spot, the odds of catching anything goes down for the individual fisherman.
At the highest level there are people who create new rules, that is, they find some aspect of the market and the economy that allows them to predict more correctly what the future price of an asset will be. Since they don't have to share their edge (fishing spot) with anyone, they can keep all the profit. Such research requires a bright mind and a lot of work, but the rewards are high (and of course proportional to assets).</p>
    
    <p> Typically, new investment techniques start at this level and then diffuse down to the lower stages as more and more people pick them up and reduce the former edge (in investment parlance called alpha) to volatility (in investment parlance called beta). Various theories are in various stages of diffusion, with some still having an edge and others appearing to have no edge at all.
Keep in mind though that you as an asset manager are not necessarily striving towards having an edge. Living off of your money will make preservation of principal, keeping up with inflation, minimizing taxes, and providing a stipend more important than outperforming the market.</p>

Epilogue Upon graduating with a PhD in theoretical physics, I worked for five years as a research associate while saving around 75% of my net income and then I retired with enough money to last me the rest of my life. I now make my living, if judged by income, as a capitalist, and, if judged by (my lack of) spending, as my own personal cook, trainer, carpenter, electrician,
mechanic, accountant, financial advisor, tailor, engineer, etc. My economic role is to invest and indirectly provide the productive factors, like factories,
tools, supermarkets, and cash registers, that make work possible, rather than the 40-80 hours a week of work itself. My effort in that regard amounts to spending a few hours every month or so, and otherwise waiting for the money to make its way into my bank account from my investments.</p>
    
    <p> If those who work for a living knew how little time it takes to "make" money this way, they would probably be less willing to accept working 40-80 hours a week for 30-40 years. Of course, I needed to save the money that allowed me to become a capitalist, but anyone who can hold a regular job for a handful of years and who has the will to save most of it can do this, so maybe it's okay that I now get to enjoy the rest of my life without an alarm clock.
What I mainly learned from my formal education--and I'd say, in my experience this holds exclusively for going to grad school and writing a dissertation--was that I alone am responsible for and capable of making my decisions and solving my problems. As an undergraduate, and even when studying for my Masters degree, it was always clear that I could get the answer from someone smarter than me if my own attempt failed.</p>
