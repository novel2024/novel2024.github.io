    <p>) Yet as early as that original paper, Clark hinted that other kinds of extensions were possible. “What about socially extended cognition?” he and Chalmers asked. “Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers? We see no reason why not.” In the years that followed, Clark continued to enlarge his conception of the kinds of entities that could serve as extensions of the mind.</p>
    
    <p> He observed that our physical movements and gestures play “an important role in an extended neural-bodily cognitive economy”; he noted that humans are inclined to create “designer environments”—carefully appointed spaces “that alter and simplify the computational tasks which our brains must perform in order to solve complex problems.” Over the course of many more published papers and books, Clark mounted a broad and persuasive argument against what he called the “brainbound” perspective—the view that thinking happens only inside the brain—and in favor of what he called the “extended” perspective, in which the rich resources of our world can and do enter into our trains of thought.
Consider me a convert. The notion of the extended mind seized my imagination and has not yet released its grip.</p>
    
    <p> During my many years of reporting, I had never before encountered an idea that changed so much about how I think, how I work, how I parent, how I navigate everyday life. It became apparent to me that Andy Clark’s bold proposal was not (or not only!) the esoteric thought experiment of an ivory tower philosopher; it was a plainly practical invitation to think differently and better. As I began to catalog the dozens of techniques for thinking outside the brain that researchers have tested and verified, I eagerly incorporated them into my own repertoire.
These include methods for sharpening our interoceptive sense, so as to use these internal signals to guide our decisions and manage our mental processes;
they encompass guidelines for the use of specific types of gesture, or particular modes of physical activity, to enhance our memory and attention.</p>
    
    <p> This research offers instructions on using time in nature to restore our focus and increase our creativity, as well as directions for designing our learning and working spaces for greater productivity and performance. The studies we’ll cover describe structured forms of social interaction that allow other people’s cognition to augment our own; they also supply guidance on how to offload, externalize, and dynamically interact with our thoughts—a much more effective approach than doing it all “in our heads.” In time I came to recognize that I was acquiring a second education—one that is increasingly essential but almost always overlooked in our focus on educating the brain. Over many years of elementary school, high school, and even college and graduate school, we’re never explicitly taught to think outside the brain;
we’re not shown how to employ our bodies and spaces and relationships in the service of intelligent thought.</p>
    
    <p> Yet this instruction is available if we know where to look; our teachers are the artists and scientists and authors who have figured out these methods for themselves, and the researchers who are, at last, making these methods the object of study.
these methods the object of study.
For my own part, I’m convinced that I could not have written this book without the help of the practices detailed within it. That’s not to say that I didn’t sometimes fall back into our culture’s default position.</p>
    
    <p> Before Friedrich Nietzsche’s fortuitous intervention that morning, I was in full brainbound mode,
my “head bowed low” over my keyboard, working my poor brain ever harder instead of looking for opportunities to extend it. I’m grateful for the nudge my research supplied; it’s that gentle push in a more productive direction that this book seeks to offer its own readers.
Frédéric Gros, the French philosopher who brought Nietzsche’s words to my attention, maintains that thinkers ought to get moving in a “quest for a different light.” As he observes, “Libraries are always too dark,” and books written among the stacks manifest this dull dimness—while “other books reflect piercing mountain light, or the sea sparkling in sunshine.</p>
    
    <p>” It’s my hope that this book will cast a different light, bring a bracing gust of fresh air to the thinking we do as students and workers, as parents and citizens, as leaders and creators.
Our society is facing unprecedented challenges, and we’ll need to think well in order to solve them. The brainbound paradigm now so dominant is clearly inadequate to the task; everywhere we look we see problems with attention and memory, with motivation and persistence, with logical reasoning and abstract thinking. Truly original ideas and innovations seem scarce; engagement levels at schools and in companies are low; teams and groups struggle to work together in an effective and satisfying way.</p>
    
    <p>
I’ve come to believe that such difficulties result in large part from a fundamental misunderstanding of how—and where—thinking happens. As long as we settle for thinking inside the brain, we’ll remain bound by the limits of that organ. But when we reach outside it with intention and skill, our thinking can be transformed. It can become as dynamic as our bodies, as airy as our spaces, as rich as our relationships—as capacious as the whole wide world.</p>
