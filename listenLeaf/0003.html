    <p> Humans have always preyed upon each other. This is a constant fact; only the methods of predation change. Typically, human beings utilize two main channels in their predation: intragroup and intergroup, which are internal and external channels, respectively.
Intragroup versus intergroup predation In any group of people such as a society, community, county, or region,
where there are shared similarities, there are typically superior and inferior parties.</p>
    
    <p> The superiority or inferiority is often determined by what the group of people defines to be the criteria for the same. For instance, it might be the economic power or the social class or so on. Often, you’ll find that the superior parties’ prey on the inferior ones for their own advancement. When this happens, intragroup predation is at play.</p>
    
    <p> A group of corporations setting up industries in a residential area occupied by poorer residents is an example of intergroup predation. In this instance, the richer section of society has no reservations about harming another less fortunate section that is vulnerable and easy prey on.
If a group considers itself to be superior to another group and preys on them (externally), this is referred to as intergroup predation. That is predation between two or more different groups.</p>
    
    <p> This is essentially what happened during colonization where European countries invaded other countries that they considered inferior and uncivilized, for their own benefit.
In your everyday life, you may not consciously notice the predators in your midst. Human predators are highly skilled at blending in with the rest of the population. They look like normal people leading relatively normal lives.</p>
    
    <p>
Whenever there is a murder or any other criminal incident in a community,
you’ll often hear a member of the community say of the perpetrator: he was such a good man, well-liked by everybody in town. We would never have suspected that he was capable of such an evil act. The truth of the matter is that the suspect was not really a good man. More often than not, he was just a bad man disguised as a good man.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, the terms bad and good do not do any justice in explaining the complex and often confusing elements that play a part in causing one to choose to become a predator.
While the monsters in your life may not always be obvious, there are some simple ways to identify a predator. If you are observant of the people you relate with, you will have an easier time telling apart the good ones from the bad ones. This is especially true if you listen more than you talk.</p>
    
    <p> You learn more when you are just listening and observing. So, what are the distinguishing marks of a human predator?
Identifying a human predator Your favorite colleague at work might be someone that you really get along with or someone who pretends to get along with you for their own benefit.
How do you tell the difference?
They are unbelievably charming The most efficient predators are also extremely charming. They know how to do and say the right things so that they come across as appealing to others.</p>
    
    <p> They come off as highly likable based on their ability to get in anybody’s good books by virtue of a few well-placed compliments and smiles. When you meet such a charmer, they will make you believe that you are the center of their universe. They will pay you attention, make you feel special and pull all the stops to impress. For many charmers, this is a learned art form.</p>
