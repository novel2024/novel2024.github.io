    <p> One of the most famous of his guinea pigs is the champion swimmer Diana Nyad. A world-record holder in distance swimming, Nyad made history in 1975 by becoming the first woman to swim around Manhattan Island. Four decades later, at the age of sixty-four,
she set out to swim from Cuba to Florida. Nyad was a model of resilience as she battled fatigue, nausea, and potentially deadly jellyfish stings over the course of the 110-mile swim.</p>
    
    <p> She failed four times in the attempt before trying, and succeeding, in August 2013.
Later that same year she became a pioneer in another fashion, arriving at Paulus’s lab to be studied. Before climbing into an MRI machine, she was fitted with a nose clip, which prevented her from breathing through her nose, and with a tube that went into her mouth. At the end of the tube was a stopper.</p>
    
    <p> When the stopper was removed, it was possible for Nyad to breathe freely through the tube; when the stopper was inserted, only a very small amount of air could pass through.
Once inside the MRI chamber, Nyad was directed to look at a computer screen mounted in front of her eyes. When the screen turned blue, the breathing tube was left open; when the screen turned yellow, there was a 25 percent chance that the tube would be plugged, forcing Nyad to struggle for breath.
Observing the activity of Nyad’s brain under each condition allowed Paulus and his colleagues to investigate how she anticipated a stressor, how she responded to a stressor, and how she recovered from a stressor.</p>
    
    <p> While all this was going on,
Nyad was also responding to questions in a test of her cognitive ability. (Writing about the experience in her autobiography, Nyad commented, “Of course I’m competitive, so I wanted to score higher than anyone who’s ever had the MRI.”) The scan of Nyad’s brain revealed a distinctive response to this uncomfortable experience. Her insula mounted an intense anticipatory response before the stressor—when the screen turned yellow—but settled down to a state of relative quiescence during and after the stressor.</p>
    
    <p> As for the cognitive test, Nyad recalls Paulus showing her the results, presented as dots charted on a digitized graph:
“Clumped at the bottom are ordinary people, who did very poorly on the test during the periods of oxygen restriction and when they were anticipating the upcoming oxygen restriction,” she recounts. “Next were a group significantly above the control group, who did much better; these were the Marines. The next group was a big bump up from that: Navy SEALS. Then Dr.</p>
    
    <p> Paulus pointed high up to the right, almost off the computer screen. This, he said, is me.” Nyad is truly an outlier, but Paulus has found the same pattern in elite performers of all stripes. Astonishingly, putting these individuals through an extremely unpleasant interoceptive experience actually improves their cognitive performance.</p>
    
    <p> These champions have a superior ability to sense their bodies’ cues, and are therefore better able to monitor and manage their bodies’ resources as they rise to meet a challenge. They are like efficient, well-calibrated motors that don’t waste even a bit of power, keeping plenty of energy in reserve.
People with low resilience, by contrast, present a very different profile. When undergoing the inspiratory breathing load task, their brain scans show a pattern that is the opposite of Diana Nyad’s: low levels of activity before a stressor, and high levels during and after the stressor.</p>
    
    <p> The self-management of these individuals is sloppy, all over the place, like poorly calibrated motors that leak power. They are brought up short by challenges, and then waste energy in the scramble to catch up. They begin to struggle to answer the test questions.
Discouraged by their failures, their energy reserves depleted, they lose motivation and give up.</p>
    
    <p>
Such differences clearly matter in attempting a physical feat of courage or endurance, but they matter, too, when the pursuit is of a more cerebral sort.
Mental activity, like any other we undertake, requires the mobilization and management of energy; indeed, the brain consumes fully 20 percent of the body’s energy supply. The ability to allocate our internal resources effectively in tackling mental challenges is a capacity researchers call “cognitive resilience.” For one of Martin Paulus’s collaborators, cognitive resilience holds a special importance.</p>
    
    <p> Elizabeth Stanley, an associate professor of security studies at Georgetown University, is a member of a storied military family who spent years working as an intelligence officer in the US Army, including postings in Germany, South Korea, and the Balkans. In military service and in civilian life,
Stanley drove herself relentlessly; she describes her modus operandi as “dig in,
access deep wells of willpower and determination, and power through.” For decades, she writes, “I considered my capacity to ignore and override my body and my emotions in this way to be a good thing—a sign of strength, self- discipline, and determination.” Eventually, however, she came to recognize that “this default strategy was actually undermining my performance and well- being.</p>
