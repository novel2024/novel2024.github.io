A note about originality Feynman once remarked that the best way to find new insights into a problem was to step out of the box, ignore previous publications, and come to your own conclusions. With such an approach, it often happens that a concept which is initially considered to be novel turns out to have been discovered already. In fact, many of the ideas in this book go back decades and even centuries.
To give an example, when I was a teenager, I wasted a lot of my time playing computer games.</p>
    
    <p> One genre I particularly enjoyed was real-time strategy: games like Dune, Warcraft I and II, and Command and Conquer.
In these games you build up forces comprised of individual units (tanks,
warriors, etc.). When these units fight, each fights at full strength until it's destroyed or killed.</p>
    
    <p> Since the rate of attrition depends on the number of weapons firing or striking, the optimal strategy in a battle is therefore for all your units to attack a single individual enemy at a time to reduce the number of enemies firing or striking as fast as possible. A great many players have independently "discovered" this strategy, called Lanchester's Square Law, without being aware that it had actually already been discovered by Frederick W.Â Lanchester during World War I. So it is with many observations about life in general.</p>
    
    <p> This incidentally is why reading the classics is very worthwhile--concepts get discovered, forgotten, and then rediscovered, either independently or by reading old books. Like Lanchester's Law, I discovered many of the concepts in this book only to find out later that someone else had already discovered and named the concept before me. Further reading revealed that yet others had written about the concept before them, and so on.3 Analogously, I'm sure that Lanchester wasn't the first person to think about how to most effectively direct the fire of siege trebuchets.</p>

A note about completeness There's always the temptation to make a book complete. However, a line must be drawn lest the book grow to the size of a minor encyclopedia.
After all, the quantity of knowledge that must be mastered is not trivial, and thus I can't describe everything. However, I hope I've used enough relevant keywords to allow a quick search on the Internet for more information.</p>
    
    <p> In all cases I've striven to use standard words rather than jargon.
A different frame of mind When I grew up, I dutifully went to school and did my homework. For the most part, schooling was about sitting still for 45 minutes while doing simple tasks that the teacher handed out. I was very good at sitting still and thus I was a good student.</p>
    
    <p> I learned how to add, multiply, divide, and subtract. I learned how to punctuate a sentence and how to spell. I learned something about chemistry. Then I learned something about physics and geology.</p>
    
    <p> At some point, the teacher introduced tests and grades. Test-taking became the primary objective; learning secondary. We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning after the test was done. In other words, we were being taught to be "flexible.</p>
