    <p> Yet this instruction is available if we know whereto look; our teachers are the artists and scientists and authors who have figuredout these methods for themselves, and the researchers who are, at last, makingthese methods the object of study.these methods the object of study.For my own part, I’m convinced that I could not have written this bookwithout the help of the practices detailed within it. That’s not to say that I didn’tsometimes fall back into our culture’s default position.</p>
    
    <p> Before FriedrichNietzsche’s fortuitous intervention that morning, I was in full brainbound mode,my “head bowed low” over my keyboard, working my poor brain ever harderinstead of looking for opportunities to extend it. I’m grateful for the nudge myresearch supplied; it’s that gentle push in a more productive direction that thisbook seeks to offer its own readers.Frédéric Gros, the French philosopher who brought Nietzsche’s words to myattention, maintains that thinkers ought to get moving in a “quest for a differentlight.” As he observes, “Libraries are always too dark,” and books writtenamong the stacks manifest this dull dimness—while “other books reflectpiercing mountain light, or the sea sparkling in sunshine.</p>
    
    <p>” It’s my hope that thisbook will cast a different light, bring a bracing gust of fresh air to the thinkingwe do as students and workers, as parents and citizens, as leaders and creators.Our society is facing unprecedented challenges, and we’ll need to think well inorder to solve them. The brainbound paradigm now so dominant is clearlyinadequate to the task; everywhere we look we see problems with attention andmemory, with motivation and persistence, with logical reasoning and abstractthinking. Truly original ideas and innovations seem scarce; engagement levels atschools and in companies are low; teams and groups struggle to work together inan effective and satisfying way.</p>
    
    <p>I’ve come to believe that such difficulties result in large part from afundamental misunderstanding of how—and where—thinking happens. As longas we settle for thinking inside the brain, we’ll remain bound by the limits of thatorgan. But when we reach outside it with intention and skill, our thinking can betransformed. It can become as dynamic as our bodies, as airy as our spaces, asrich as our relationships—as capacious as the whole wide world.</p>
    
    <p>Introduction:Thinking Outside the BrainU SE YOUR HEAD.How many times have you heard that phrase? Perhaps you’ve even urged it onsomeone else—a son or daughter, a student, an employee. Maybe you’vemuttered it under your breath while struggling with an especially tricky problem,or when counseling yourself to remain rational: Use your head!The command is a common one, issued in schools, in the workplace, amid thetrials of everyday life. Its refrain finds an echo in culture both high and low,from Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker, chin resting thoughtfully on fist, to thebulbous cartoon depiction of the brain that festoons all manner of products andwebsites—educational toys, nutritional supplements, cognitive fitness exercises.</p>
    
    <p>When we say it, we mean: call on the more than ample powers of your brain,draw on the magnificent lump of tissue inside your skull. We place a lot of faithin that lump; whatever the problem, we believe, the brain can solve it.But what if our faith is misplaced? What if the directive to “use your head,”ubiquitous though it may be, is misguided? A burgeoning body of researchsuggests that we’ve got it exactly backwards. As it is, we use our brains entirelytoo much—to the detriment of our ability to think intelligently.</p>
    
    <p> What we need todo is think outside the brain.Thinking outside the brain means skillfully engaging entities external to ourheads—the feelings and movements of our bodies, the physical spaces in whichwe learn and work, and the minds of the other people around us—drawing theminto our own mental processes. By reaching beyond the brain to recruit these“extra-neural” resources, we are able to focus more intently, comprehend moredeeply, and create more imaginatively—to entertain ideas that would be literallyunthinkable by the brain alone. It’s true that we’re more accustomed to thinkingabout our bodies, our spaces, and our relationships.</p>
    
    <p> But we can also think withand through them—by using the movements of our hands to understand andexpress abstract concepts, for example, or by arranging our workspace in waysthat promote idea generation, or by engaging in social practices like teaching andstorytelling that lead to deeper understanding and more accurate memory. Ratherthan exhorting ourselves and others to use our heads, we should be applyingextra-neural resources to the project of thinking outside the skull’s narrowcircumference.But wait, you may be asking: What’s the need? Isn’t the brain, on its own, upto the job? Actually, no. We’ve been led to believe that the human brain is anall-purpose, all-powerful thinking machine.</p>
    
    <p> We’re deluged with reports ofdiscoveries about the brain’s astounding abilities, its lightning quickness and itsprotean plasticity; we’re told that the brain is a fathomless wonder, “the mostcomplex structure in the universe.” But when we clear away the hype, weconfront the fact that the brain’s capacities are actually quite constrained andspecific. The less heralded scientific story of the past several decades has beenresearchers’ growing awareness of the brain’s limits. The human brain is limitedin its ability to pay attention, limited in its capacity to remember, limited in itsfacility with abstract concepts, and limited in its power to persist at a challengingtask.</p>
    
    <p>Importantly, these limits apply to everyone’s brain. It’s not a matter ofindividual differences in intelligence; it’s a matter of the character of the organwe all possess, its biological nature and its evolutionary history. The brain doesdo a few things exquisitely well—things like sensing and moving the body,navigating through space, and connecting with other humans. These activities itcan manage fluently, almost effortlessly.</p>
