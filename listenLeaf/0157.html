Ferstenou, You can retire young [72] Joe Dominguez and Vicky Robin, Your Money or Your Life Footnotes (1) If you struggle to understand the book, it's likely that I'm just over- complicating and over-analyzing everything. Some like that, some don't.</p>
    
    <p> My life looks very similar to other extreme early retirees.
Indeed, I've never thought so much about the concepts in this book as when I was writing it. Ordinarily, I don't use mind maps to fry an egg and I don't have a strategy for putting on socks. I do have a strategy for buying socks, though.</p>
    
    <p> I buy them all in the same color and form. That way I don't have to match them up pair by pair while doing laundry,
and if one sock fails, I don't have to throw out the other one.
(2) This idea follows from the belief from the Dark Ages that the best way to gain knowledge was to read and interpret 1,000-year-old books,
something which still occurs in the humanities, though now it has taken to analyzing modern authors.
(3) Also I found that the "quadrants" in Economic degrees of freedom are similar to the Cashflow Quadrant book by Robert Kiyosaki even as they were inspired by the types described in Maccoby's earlier book The Gamesman and the arrangement itself (the dimensions) comes from Charles Perrow's Normal Accident Theory.</p>
    
    <p> It's also possible to identify the "working man" with the working class or the working poor, the "salaryman" with the middle class, the "businessman" with the capitalist class, and the "Renaissance man" with the creative class in modern sociology. In feudal Japan, the four types were the gentry (samurai), farmers, artisans, and merchants. Richard Bartle's Players to Suit MUDs is an interesting paper analyzing the four different types of computer game players--killers, socializers, explorers, and achievers-- classified according to their preference for acting with or acting on other players or the game world, respectively. That paper will teach you everything you need to know about management theory.</p>

(4) Modern movie watchers might prefer the film "The Matrix," which has a similar premise.
(5) Thanks to government-induced inflation of the money supply, this is a growing number. $1 million now is considered insufficient by a growing number of people, even though most people will never accumulate such a sum.
(6) The average American produces a little less than a ton of waste each year.</p>
