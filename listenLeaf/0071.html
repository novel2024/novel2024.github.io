All of us possess this powerful place-based memory system simply by virtue of being human—but some, like Ben Pridmore and his memory champion peers,
make far better use of it. The rest of us can learn to do what they do, as demonstrated in a study led by neuroscientist Martin Dresler of Radboud University in the Netherlands. Dresler and his collaborators (who included Boris Nikolai Konrad, himself a decorated memory athlete) tested two dozen of the world’s top memory competitors, comparing their performance on a word- memorization task to that of a group of ordinary citizens. Not surprisingly, the memory champions came out ahead, correctly recalling an average of seventy- one words from the list of seventy-two words they were given, with a number of them turning in perfect scores.</p>
    
    <p> Regular people recalled an average of only twenty-nine words. After six weeks of training using the method of loci,
however, these previously undistinguished experimental participants turned in an impressively improved performance, more than doubling their average score.
Associating information to be learned with a sense of physical space can help people remember in real-world situations too—whether it’s a high school student memorizing verb conjugations, a medical resident learning a litany of diseases and their symptoms, or a best man practicing a speech for a rehearsal dinner.
Undergraduates who take the course on civil liberties taught by Charles Wilson,
a professor of political science at the University of North Georgia, have to learn a multitude of new facts and ideas.</p>
    
    <p> Wilson helps them do so by showing them how to link individual pieces of information to particular locations within a space they know well: the campus cafeteria, familiarly called the “Chow Hall.” For students struggling to recall the provisions set forth in the Bill of Rights,
for example, Wilson encourages them to imagine stepping up to the Chow Hall soup tureens: the soup course, which comes first in a meal, thus becomes associated with the First Amendment. Then on to the station where bread is sliced; here Wilson recommends that students picture a pile of the severed limbs of grizzly bears, a scenario sure to prompt a memory of the Second Amendment and its assurance of the right to “bear arms.” That image is a bit grisly, but Wilson and his students have found that imagery that is garish or outlandish more readily triggers recall.</p>
    
    <p> Obeying that principle, Wilson’s students learn to associate the landmark court case of McDonald v. City of Chicago with an image of the fast food clown Ronald McDonald, wearing a Chicago Bulls jersey, filling his plate at the salad bar. And so on through the remaining eight amendments in the Bill of Rights, each one paired with an imagined sampling of the Chow Hall’s culinary offerings.
Wilson’s students enjoy the exercise, and they say it helps them enormously in remembering material for the course.</p>
    
    <p> Many students have told him that they’ve started using the method of loci to study for their other classes as well.
The human brain is not well equipped to remember a mass of abstract information. But it is perfectly tuned to recalling details associated with places it knows—and by drawing on this natural mastery of physical space, we can (as knows—and by drawing on this natural mastery of physical space, we can (as Martin Dresler showed) more than double our effective memory capacity.
Extending our minds via physical space can do more than improve our recall,
however.</p>
    
    <p> Our powers of spatial cognition can help us to think and reason effectively, to achieve insight and solve problems, and to come up with creative ideas. Such powers are especially generative when permitted to operate not on imagined space, as in the method of loci, but on the real thing: tangible, three- dimensional space, of the kind our minds and bodies are so accustomed to navigating.
Our culture tends to valorize doing things in one’s head; we are awed by mathematicians who can engage in elaborate mental calculations, chess grandmasters who can plot a long progression of moves in their mind’s eye— and, yes, memory champions, who can remember so much without reference to external prompts. But true human genius lies in the way we are able to take facts and concepts out of our heads, using physical space to spread out that material,
to structure it, and to see it anew.</p>
    
    <p> The places we make for ideas can take many forms: a bank of computer screens, the pages of a field notebook, the surface of a workshop table—or even, as one celebrated author demonstrates, an expanse of office wall.
 “BRILLIANT,” “masterful,” and “monumental” are words regularly used to describe the work of historian Robert Caro. He was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for The Power Broker, his sweeping biography of the urban planner Robert Moses.
Assigned in many college courses, the book has sold more than 400,000 copies and has never been out of print since its publication in 1974.</p>
    
    <p> For the past four decades, Caro has been writing about the midcentury political maestro Lyndon B. Johnson—four volumes and counting, including Master of the Senate (another Pulitzer winner) and Means of Ascent. In total, he has written more than four thousand well-honed, fact-rich pages of prose over the course of an acclaimed career.
But at first Caro struggled even to wrap his head around his subjects.</p>
