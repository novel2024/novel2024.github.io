Completing these lists is left as an exercise for the reader. In fact, such an exercise is highly recommended. Try to make it as wide-ranging as possible and as complete as possible. It may range wider and include more dimensions than suggested above.</p>
    
    <p>
Each level on each list has a price and a value which is individually unique. The ultimate goal is maximizing total value while minimizing the total price. While the locked-in lifestyle described in The lock-in provides a default choice of levels, it's possible to choose one's levels very differently.
For instance, instead of choosing a career in a cubicle, a five- bedroom/three-bathroom home on a 30-year mortgage, and a new TV on credit, one may choose financial independence and early retirement.</p>

Building blocks The world is like a box of Legos. A box of Legos comes with blocks and instructions to build a particular model or product out of the blocks,
specifically blocks + instructions = model.
However, the world is normally not perceived as a box of Legos.
Mostly, the accompanying instructions are followed slavishly and the fact that the blocks can be combined creatively into new models is forgotten.</p>
    
    <p>
This turns the box into a kit model. Mentally, this reduces the concept of a building block from something that can be creatively combined in many different ways to being merely "part 27a" which is to be fitted with "part 27b" in step "8." Even worse, much of the world comes preassembled. With the blocks thus gone, this reduces the equation to instructions = model.</p>
    
    <p>
Often the instructions are reduced and simplified under the mantra of being easier to use. This reduces not only the creativity of the user but also the operating skills, which are transferred into the model or product. The product turns from being low-tech but high-concept to being high-tech but low-concept.
The beauty of this from a business perspective is that each model can be turned into a profitable product and sold separately.</p>
    
    <p> This is the reason that we now have electric rice cookers, egg cookers, bread-makers, toasters,
hamburger cookers, etc. and as a consequence people have forgotten how to fry an egg in a pan,46 amongst other things. Hence, the equation has been reduced to product = model,
where the only instruction people need to know is "Get into your car and drive down to a shop and buy the product. Then go to work and make money to pay for it.</p>
    
    <p>" At this level of incompetence, success can only come from buying a product. More products, more success. This is expensive and wasteful. Just think of how many times a pan and a heating element are replicated in the appliances mentioned above, not to mention that electricity is a really inappropriate source of heat.</p>
    
    <p>
To avoid this waste, we must relearn how to fry an egg, specifically by realizing that frying an egg first and foremost requires a surface that transfers heat and a source of heat, and not necessarily the "Wonderfryer 3000." In more general terms, we must once again perceive the building blocks to construct more economical solutions. This doesn't mean that you literally have to go and take your appliances apart. Rather, it means considering what kind of utility a product provides and what kind of need or want you have, and then think of other more economical means of solving a specific problem by using a different way of putting the blocks together.</p>
