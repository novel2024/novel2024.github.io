    <p> I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void.” Scientists have a term for the “void” Murakami describes: “transient hypofrontality.</p>
    
    <p>” Hypo means low or diminished, and frontality refers to the frontal region of the brain—the part that plans, analyzes, and critiques, and that usually maintains firm control over our thoughts and behavior. When all of our resources are devoted to managing the demands of intense physical activity,
however, the influence of the prefrontal cortex is temporarily reduced. In this loose hypofrontal mode, ideas and impressions mingle more freely; unusual and unexpected thoughts arise. Scientists speculate that the phenomenon of transient hypofrontality may underlie all kinds of altered states, from dreaming to drug trips—but intense exercise may be the most reliable way to induce it.</p>
    
    <p> Low- and moderate-intensity exercise does not generate this disinhibiting effect. (Indeed,
as we’ve seen, moderately intense physical activity actually enhances executive function.) Achieving transient hypofrontality generally requires exercising at one’s “ventilatory threshold”—the point at which breathing becomes labored,
corresponding to about 80 percent of the exerciser’s maximum heart rate—for forty minutes or more.
It’s a daunting summit to scale, but when it is reached, observes Kathryn Schulz, another writer-runner, it can “provoke a kind of Cartesian collapse”:
mind and body melding together in what she calls a “glorious collusion.</p>
    
    <p>”  IN CONSIDERING THE IMPACT of motion on thought, the releasing or enhancing or disinhibiting effects of physical activity are only half the story. Also important are the many varied and nuanced ways that particular physical movements,
which carry their own load of meaning and information, participate in our thinking processes. Over the past several decades, the field of embodied cognition has produced persuasive evidence that our thoughts—even, or especially, those of an abstract or symbolic nature—are powerfully shaped by the way we move our bodies. According to the conventional, brainbound understanding of cognition, we first have a thought, and then direct our bodies to move accordingly.</p>
    
    <p> This more recent corpus of research turns that causal arrow around so that it points in the opposite direction: we move our bodies, and our thoughts are influenced in turn. The exciting implication of such findings is that we can intentionally enhance our mental functioning through an application of physical activity—that we can, for example, improve our memory not through working our brains ever harder, but by looping in the meaning-bearing movements of our limbs.
When we’re charged with learning and remembering new material, our tendency is to lean heavily on visual and auditory modes: reading it over, saying it aloud. This approach has its limits; in particular, research demonstrates that our memory for what we have heard is remarkably weak.</p>
    
    <p> Our memory for what we have done, however—for physical actions we have undertaken—is much more robust. Linking movement to the material to be recalled creates a richer and therefore more indelible “memory trace” in the brain. In addition,
movements engage a process called procedural memory (memory of how to do something, such as how to ride a bike) that is distinct from declarative memory (memory of informational content, such as the text of a speech). When we connect movement with information, we activate both types of memory, and our recall is more accurate as a result—a phenomenon that researchers call the “enactment effect.</p>
    
    <p>” Fittingly, professional actors can shed light on the way physical enactment reinforces memory. Helga Noice, a professor emeritus of psychology at Elmhurst University in Illinois, and her husband, Tony Noice, a professor of theater at Elmhurst as well as a Chicago-area actor, have spent years studying actors’ ability to memorize pages and pages of lines. They have determined that during performance, actors render written lines with 98 percent accuracy, on average; months after a play’s run has ended, the Noices found, actors can still recall verbatim some 90 percent of the script. How do they do it? Actors’ mental feats of memory, the Noices have concluded, are intimately connected to the movements they make with their bodies.</p>
    
    <p> In the course of their research, many actors commented that they never tried to learn their lines until a play had been “blocked”—that is, until all the physical movements to be made onstage had been planned out. “You’ve got to have these two tracks going simultaneously —‘This is what I say, and this is when and where I move’ . . .</p>
