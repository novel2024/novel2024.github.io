    <p> Do not give your insecurities a platform on which to shine. Instead, practice faking it until you make it.
There are people in this world who do not know a whole lot of things and yet have managed to get scores of people to support them and their ideas.
Reason? They are the epitome of confidence.</p>
    
    <p> They walk into rooms as if they own them. They speak authoritatively even when they are uncertain of what they talk about. Confidence says you know what you are talking about. People allow themselves to believe the people who know what they are talking about.</p>
    
    <p>
Tip #2: Be subtle with your approach Even when they allow themselves to be persuaded into doing something,
most people like to think that it was their idea to do something in the first place. Nobody wants to believe that they allowed a particular idea to be shoved down their throat. For success in persuasion, you must be subtle in your approach. Instead of introducing a certain topic full-on, consider starting with an anecdote.</p>
    
    <p> If you are looking to get someone to buy into an investment, start by mentioning how you and your friends went for a cruise last weekend after receiving your payout from Investment X. Do not even try to sell them that investment. Instead, get the other person thinking about how they could also have gone for the cruise had they invested in the particular investment vehicle. In short, entice people without being too obvious with your temptation.</p>
    
    <p>
Tip #3: Be flexible with your methods The methods of persuasion are not set in stone. Different people respond to different things. Also, the same person will respond differently to different methods depending on the time and occasion. You must know when to switch gears accordingly.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes you will need to work with the principle of liking and other times you will need to base your method on the principle of authority. Reading social cues will allow you to determine which methods to use.
Tip #4: Timing is everything If you want to convince someone to buy a house, youâ€™ll have more success if you catch them when they are shopping for houses. This holds true for most things.</p>
    
    <p> If you want your crush to go from crush to partner, you will have an easier time if you talk to them when they are looking for a relationship. To master the art of persuasion, you must also master the art of knowing when the timing is right. If not, you will fall into the trap of harassing people to agree to things that they have no interest in. Nobody likes a person that is constantly pestering them into doing things, especially at the weirdest of times.</p>
    
    <p>
Tip #5: Being interesting is a plus Most persuasive people are not boring. Nobody pays much attention to boring people. Boring people are not fun to talk to. They are not engaging,
and they are definitely not memorable.</p>
