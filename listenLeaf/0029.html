Thanks to a secular--possibly demographically driven--asset boom, it has become increasingly popular for individuals to save for retirement by investing directly in the equity/financial markets, a job that has previously been handled by banks and businessmen, using the savings of the customers. This kind of "investing" is thought of as a savings account compounding at very high interest rates that are believed to manifest themselves as practically risk-free by waving one's arms and mumbling something about "the long run." However, dollar cost averaging--in the form of regular and typically automatic monthly contributions to a retirement account based on financial investments--is conceptually not much different from establishing a savings account in a foreign currency,
except this one is denominated in company equity. Both suffer from the risk of needing to sell in a down market.</p>
    
    <p>
Dollar cost averaging naturally provides steady employment for fund managers and most everyone else associated with the stock market. Regular contributions are therefore sold to the public as something that is beneficial.
In reality, dollar cost averaging is a double-edged sword. Proponents usually imagine a scenario of an initial market decline that recovers.</p>
    
    <p> In this case, even though the starting and ending price are the same, the average cost is lower, thus resulting in an overall investment gain. Now consider the scenario of a rising market that subsequently declines. In this case, the average cost is higher than the start and ending price, and the investor will have lost money. In fact, given that markets rise much more slowly than they drop, a dollar cost averaging investor is more likely to make an entry and invest larger amounts while the market is rising than during its decline.</p>
    
    <p>
At its best, dollar cost averaging provides no benefit, but regardless, dollar cost averaging is an excellent way of providing steady work for Wall Street,
which collects fees and commissions to invest the steady stream of money from workers.
The mutual fund industry typically charges around one percent of all assets annually, which over the years adds up to a substantial fraction,
regardless of performance. Since the risk-reward profiles of most, but not all fund advisors are skewed--that is, fail conventionally and you're okay;
fail unconventionally and you're fired; win conventionally and you're okay;
win unconventionally and you're a genius--mutual fund advisors that wish to keep their jobs tend to flock together and behave like a herd. This has resulted in the growing popularity of "buy and hold" index funds, which simply mimic what everybody else is doing, on average, at less cost.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, the emerging behavior of such a strategy is eventual chaos, as nobody leads and everybody follows each other.
Buy and hold is an investment strategy with no exit strategy. What this typically means is that stocks are usually liquidated when money is needed,
rather than taking into account when a given stock is overvalued. The aggregate effect of workers investing in this manner is to turn the stock market into an elaborate demographical Ponzi scheme, where the value of investments depends on how many people are retiring and how many people are entering the labor market.</p>
    
    <p> In particular, it depends on the level of confidence that the most recent entrant has in the system, and hence this becomes a policy matter. Diversification doesn't prevent the effects of something as systemic as this. Instead, it reinforces the problem, as everybody behaves the same. If stocks are supplied and demanded according to how many are entering and leaving the workforce, then market price becomes dependent on demographics.</p>
    
    <p>
The consequence of retirement accounts and the reliance on automatic savings in equity markets is a large class of people who have very little equity ownership compared to their level of consumption. Nobody thinks of using improvements in technology and productivity to allow people to work less and require fewer assets to achieve the same standard of living. Instead,
while everybody is richer, at least in terms of stuff, no one is any wealthier.
Their wealth is "safely" out of reach.</p>
    
    <p> If it weren't, how many would still show up for work the next day?
Individual investment in productivity other than personal ability to work harder remains dismally low. Only a few entrepreneurs spend money on increasing their productivity to increase their current cash flow. Others have few asset investments outside of their retirement accounts.
Retirement Retirement is a relatively new phenomenon.</p>
