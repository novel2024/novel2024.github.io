    <p>” Intriguing though it is to contemplate, Rawls’s scenario has always been hard to enter into fully—so closely are we identified with what we take to be our “natural assets and abilities,” our “intelligence” foremost among them. The theory of the extended mind is a tool with which we might begin to pry loose this instinctive identification. Unlike innate intelligence, which we imagine to be an inseparable part of who we “are,” access to mental extensions is more readily understood as a matter of chance or luck. This radically new conceptual theory harbors within it an old and humble moral sentiment: “There but for the grace of God go I.</p>
    
    <p>” Acknowledging the reality of the extended mind might well lead us to embrace the extended heart.
Acknowledgments The cognitive psychologist Stephen Kosslyn has proposed a notion that is a close cousin to the theory of the extended mind: he submits that one individual can engage another as a “social prosthetic.” As he has written (with G. Wayne Miller): “The crucial idea is that when you are interacting with another person in this way, he or she has the capacity to make you more effective .</p>
    
    <p> . . He or she fills in for your lack. And in the process, at that moment you become a different person, transformed by your interactions with the other.</p>
    
    <p>” Two people functioned in this way for me during the writing of this book:
Tina Bennett and Eamon Dolan. At moments when I doubted that I could pull off this ambitious project, Tina and Eamon filled in for my lack, supplying me with all the hope and confidence and inspiration I could want. Thank you, Tina,
and thank you, Eamon.
Many other people worked hard to make this book a reality.</p>
    
    <p> I’m grateful to the editorial and production team at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt: Deb Brody, Ivy Givens, Bruce Nichols (now at Little, Brown), and Beth Burleigh Fuller.
Amanda Heller provided a scrupulous copyedit. Mark Robinson designed a gorgeous cover. At WME, Jay Mandel was a sure-footed guide, assisted by the extremely capable Sian-Ashleigh Edwards.</p>
    
    <p> Joseph Hinson and his team at Out:think Group built me a wonderful website; Stephanie Anestis cheerfully took my author photo on a cold and windy New Haven day. Mika Yamaguchi, of Yale University’s Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures, helped me with the section on Radio Taiso.
During the long period of researching and writing this book, I was fortunate enough to be supported by three fellowships granted by New America: the Bernard L. Schwartz Fellowship, the Future Tense Fellowship, and the Learning Sciences Exchange Fellowship (offered in conjunction with the Jacobs Foundation).</p>
    
    <p> My sincere thanks are due to Anne-Marie Slaughter, Lisa Guernsey, Andrés Martinez, Peter Bergen, Awista Ayub, Torie Bosch, and Elise Franchino. Work on this book was also supported by the Spencer Foundation. As a recipient of the Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship, I’m grateful to the Spencer Foundation’s president emeritus Michael McPherson; to LynNell Spencer Foundation’s president emeritus Michael McPherson; to LynNell Hancock and Marguerite Holloway of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism; and to my fellow fellows Jamaal Abdul-Alim and Lauren Smith Camera. I’d also like to recognize my erstwhile colleagues at the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning at Yale University: Jennifer Frederick, Mark Graham,
Tracie Addy, and Beth Luoma.</p>

The content of this book was enriched by many conversations with researchers, educators, writers, and editors. I’m indebted to the scientists who made time to answer my questions about their work. My deepest appreciation as well to a cadre of informal advisers who helped me think through the issues explored in this book: Paul Bloom, David Daniel, David Dockterman, Dan Willingham, and Carl Zimmer. I’d also like to acknowledge the insights gleaned from interactions with Mahzarin Banaji, Tina Barseghian, Emily Bazelon, Ulrich Boser, Bill Brown, Adam Cohen, Nicky Dawidoff, Jacob Hacker, Jake Halpern,
Carla Horwitz, Scott Barry Kaufman, Holly Korbey, Doug Lemov, Steve Levingston, Daniel Markovits, Kyle Pedersen, Robert Pondiscio, Jessica Sager,
