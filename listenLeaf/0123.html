Otherwise, learn how to put the rest together, instead of relying on companies to supply them to you with additives at a higher cost. This only requires searching the web for "homemade X" or "DIY X" every time you need X. My last search was for oven cleaner; no problem.
Transportation Travel is the process of getting from A to B and transportation is the means of travel.</p>
    
    <p> Solving the transportation problem starts by strategically minimizing the distance between A and B, as described in How to find shelter. Successfully minimizing this distance permits walking and cycling.
Not having a car saves a lot of money (see Driving) and moving around by muscle power increases fitness--countries show an inverse correlation between obesity and miles traveled under human power. This in turn can substitute for an entire cardio program by either running or doing interval cycling (pick a mile marker and go all out until you hit level 8) on the way home.</p>
    
    <p> If you planned the location of your residence relative to your work properly, it's not very far.
One strategy, is to think of cars as recreational vehicles, like I believe they were originally intended to be. As such, use them for tours on weekends and use your feet or your bike on weekdays, rather than the other way around. This requires a lot of discipline, so it may be better to get rid of the car outright and rent one on weekends.</p>

Comparing modes of transportation Consider these times to reach a destination about three miles away:
Walking: 45 minutes96 Running: 25 minutes Cycling: 15 minutes Driving: 10 minutes One reason that the faster methods are so similar is that a surprisingly large amount of time is spent waiting for traffic lights to change--even for running, it's probably 3-4 minutes. In particular, cycling and driving include time "preparing" the vehicle and parking it again.
I think one has to offer a fairly convincing argument to use a car rather than a bicycle just to save five minutes. Hauling is no argument, because one can easily fit a heavy-duty cargo trailer to a low-geared bicycle, which due to its open nature can haul as much as a truck, if not more.</p>
    
    <p> I'm not exaggerating: You could transport a big refrigetor with a bicycle trailer.
Time-wise, I can even make the argument for running and walking rather than using a bicycle, especially if it's raining, since proper maintenance requires spending 15 minutes wiping down the bike at the destination. The list above doesn't consider the time spent paying for and maintaining the cars, bikes, and shoes, respectively.
Suppose we make 10 such trips weekly, 50 weeks a year; that's 500 trips a year.</p>
    
    <p> This will take Walking: 22,500 minutes Running: 12,500 minutes Cycling: 7,500 minutes Driving: 5,000 minutes According to government statistics, the average person spends 20% of his income on vehicles. The average person also works 2,000 hours or 120,000 minutes a year. 20% of that is 24,000 minutes. A bike can be had for $50 and up, so that's about 300 minutes of work to buy it, but let's say 1,000 minutes a year -- I think that's quite conservative considering how long a bicycle lasts.</p>
    
    <p> With daily rides you'll have a flat every third month or so and those will take 15 minutes to fix, so that's an hour a year. That makes it 1,060 minutes. Shoe soles are about $40 a year if walking and twice that for running, which costs maybe 250 or 500 minutes to pay for. Adding that we get the following numbers:
Walking: 22,750 minutes Running: 13,000 minutes Cycling: 8,560 minutes Driving: 29,000 minutes For a distance of three miles, the most optimal in money-time mode of transportation is cycling.</p>
    
    <p> It's interesting to note that driving a car is almost as economically efficient (time is money) as just putting your shoes on and starting to walk--it's likely that a big reason for this is that the car and oil industries are heavily subsidized. Keep in mind that this presumes you're always capable of making more money. If you're salaried, paid overtime is typically not possible. You can do a similar calculation based on the time you spend getting to your destination and the cost of your shoes, bicycle,
and car, respectively.</p>
