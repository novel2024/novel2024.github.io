    <p> Try for a moment to envision the large pile of abandoned yet functional telephones, TVs,
furniture, toys, old clothes and shoes, LPs, CDs, and packaging material that you have discarded so far in your life. Such stuff doesn't magically disappear. It goes somewhere, typically a landfill. Now multiply that by several hundred million people--not cool! In the same vein, tally up the sum total of your earned income so far, subtract your savings, and compare the difference to your pile of stuff.</p>
    
    <p> Was it really a good deal?
Is spending the most productive years of your life chained to the job market to collect a lot of rarely used stuff that gathers dust in the closet or takes up space in junkyards a wise choice? Were you really born just to die,
leaving a large pile of discarded consumer goods? Probably not. I realize that not wanting a house full of things makes me look weird and recently even "unpatriotic." After all, more is better, and who doesn't want to be better? But perhaps conformity is not the only way to live. In fact, by taking the other end of the bargain, saving as much as other people are spending on wants, it's possible to retire and live on invested savings after just five years of full-time work.</p>
    
    <p> Rather than increasing the amount of work to acquire more stuff, reducing this superficial need reduces the amount of necessary work. It's possible to reduce the amount of work all the way down to zero: financial independence. Indeed, playing the shadow game for five years provides a permanent way out of the cave. Alternatively, it's also possible to return to the cave for a few months every year to earn money for the next adventure out of the cave.</p>
    
    <p> This is living on the economy, so to speak, rather than living in the economy.
The resulting freedom can be spent on personal projects such as reading books, visiting places, entertaining, exploring, cooking, learning, and experiencing. It can also be used to start businesses, engage in a second career, care for family members, etc.Â  without worrying about having to support oneself.</p>
    
    <p> This book explains how, but it really becomes quite simple once you realize that the option is there. I have done it, and others have, too.
In my mind, financial independence provides a greater sense of balance to one's life compared to doing just one thing. In addition, it doesn't postpone this balance until traditional retirement age, when people who have been stuck in the same place all their life decide that they need to travel, only to find that they're sick of traveling after a while because they never figured out exactly what makes them happy.</p>
    
    <p>
The most frequent objection to casting off the chains is that living on something corresponding to every third paycheck, or even every fourth paycheck ($6,000-$10,000 a year), as opposed to living paycheck to paycheck, must be a boring life. Not knowing any better, I must admit that I started my own adventure with such assumptions, but back then the knowledge and the wisdom relevant to such an undertaking wasn't as easy to come by as it is today. I had to discover everything from scratch. I grew up as a consumer and spent my money on increasingly larger toys.</p>
    
    <p> I knew a ton about various CPUs, and how to match memory and graphics cards to build the ultimate gaming platform. I also had pretty good hand-eye coordination from many hours spent playing computer games. Like most consumers, I was wholly ignorant of ways to attain a high-quality life without spending money. This is why retirement savings goals are frequently in the millions.</p>
    
    <p> Those--and they're a majority--who have to pay for every convenience really need that much to replicate a median income lifestyle. As a lifelong consumer used to spending large amounts of money to obtain food, stuff, and entertainment, it's hard to imagine how it's possible to spend practically nothing on furniture, a few dollars on clothing,
very little on food, almost nothing on transport, and generally less on rent/mortgage.
However, it's possible to live on a third or even a quarter of the median income, putting one solidly below the government defined poverty line,
without living in austerity or eating grits. There is no reason to pay "retail.</p>
