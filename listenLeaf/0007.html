    <p> D. Craig, it would be more accurate to say, “I feel, therefore I am.” Craig maintains that interoceptive awareness is the basis of the “material me,” the source of our most fundamental knowledge of ourselves. Because our hearts beat, because our lungs expand, because our muscles stretch and our organs rumble—and because all these sensations, unique to us, have carried on without interruption since the day of our birth—we know what it is to be one continuous self, to be ourselves and no other.</p>
    
    <p> Interoception, says Craig, is nothing less than “the feeling of being alive.” 2 Thinking with Movement DR. JEFF FIDLER is a radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
In the course of his professional duties, he regularly reviews fifteen thousand or more images a day—and he used to do so sitting down.</p>
    
    <p> Not anymore. These days Fidler walks as he looks, having set up a treadmill in front of the large screen that displays the radiological slides he is charged with examining. Within the first year of creating his “walking workstation,” Fidler lost twenty-five pounds—and, he felt convinced, he was doing a better job of identifying the abnormalities hidden in the X-ray images he scrutinized.
With a colleague, Fidler designed a study to test his hunch.</p>
    
    <p> Radiologists inspected a batch of images while seated, and while walking on a treadmill at one mile per hour. The participating physicians identified a total of 1,582 areas of concern in the slides, and rated 459 of these as posing potentially serious risks to the health of the patient. When they compared the “detection rates” they achieved while sitting and while moving, the results were clear: radiologists who remained seated spotted an average of 85 percent of the irregularities present in the images, while those who walked identified, on average, fully 99 percent of them.
Other evidence supports Fidler’s findings.</p>
    
    <p> A study conducted at the University of Maryland Medical Center, for example, found that radiologists reviewing images of patients’ lungs were more likely to identify potentially problematic nodules if they walked rather than sat as they worked. And a study conducted by physicians in the radiology department of the Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Virginia, found that radiologists who used a treadmill workstation did their work faster, with no loss of accuracy.
A different set of research findings helps to explain the radiologists’ results.
When we’re engaged in physical activity, our visual sense is sharpened,
especially with regard to stimuli appearing in the periphery of our gaze.</p>
    
    <p> This shift, which is also found in non-human animals, makes evolutionary sense: the visual system becomes more sensitive when we are actively exploring our environment. When our bodies are at rest—that is, sitting still in a chair—this heightened acuity is dialed down.
Such activity-induced alterations in the way we process visual information constitute just one example of how moving our bodies changes the way we think. Scientists have long known that overall physical fitness supports cognitive function; people who have fitter bodies generally have keener minds.</p>
    
    <p> In recent years, however, researchers have begun to explore an exciting additional possibility: that single bouts of physical activity can enhance our cognition in the short term. By moving our bodies in certain ways, that is, we’re immediately able to think more intelligently. Scientists investigating this phenomenon have approached it from two different directions: the intensity of the movement and the type of movement. As we’ll soon see, low-, medium-, and high-intensity physical activity each exerts a distinct effect on our cognition.</p>
    
    <p> Later on in the chapter, we’ll explore how certain types of movement—congruent movements,
novel movements, self-referential movements, and metaphorical movements— can also extend our thinking beyond what is possible when we remain stationary.
The tight connection between thinking and moving is a legacy of our species’s evolutionary history. The human brain is approximately three times larger than it “should” be, given the dimensions of the human body; according to fossil evidence, a remarkable expansion in the size of the brain took place about 2 million years ago. Scientists have proposed various reasons for this increase,
such as the growing complexity of our forebears’ social interactions or the need to adapt to changing ecological conditions.</p>
    
    <p> Recently, another explanation has been put forth: “At the same time as brain size began to increase in the human lineage, aerobic activity levels appear to have changed dramatically,” notes David Raichlen, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Southern California. “Human ancestors transitioned from a relatively sedentary ape-like existence to a hunting and gathering lifestyle which required an increased amount of physical activity compared to earlier hominins.” Raichlen, who has conducted extensive studies of some of the world’s remaining hunter-gatherer tribes, points out that this way of life is both physically and cognitively demanding. Foraging requires vigorous, sustained physical activity; it also makes demands on attention, memory, spatial navigation, motor control, and executive functions like planning and decision making.</p>
    
    <p> Hunting, too, poses both a mental and a physical challenge: the hunter has to locate the animal and track its unpredictable movements even while mustering the energy to outrun it. Such are the conditions under which the unique human brain evolved. The dual demands of physical challenge and cognitive complexity shaped our special status as Homo sapiens; to this day,
bodily activity and mental acuity are still intimately intertwined.
Of course, things have changed for those of us who live in modern societies;
we are no longer a species on the move.</p>
