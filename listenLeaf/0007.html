    <p> A wise person once said that if the deal is too good, you should think twice. If a person comes across as flawless and perfect, it is probably because they are wearing a mask. Once this mask comes off, you will be in a whole lot of trouble.
Secondly, know yourself in and out so that another person will never be able to blindside you.</p>
    
    <p> Everyone has their vulnerable spots. If you are unaware of where your blind spots are, you will be open season for human predators. Predators are like sharks--one drop of blood and they are all over you like white on rice. Get to know where you bleed from and keep this knowledge hidden far away inside of you until you are one hundred percent certain that a person can be trusted with this information.</p>
    
    <p>
The third way to defend yourself against predators is by using time to your advantage. According to statistics released by the World Bank, the average life expectancy in the US in 2018 was 78 while in Canada this figure stood at 80. This means that if you live in either of these places, you have a very good chance of living past the age of seventy. So why is everyone in such a hurry? Unfortunately, we live in a world where everyone is in a hurry to go somewhere or get something.</p>
    
    <p> In the midst of all this hurry are predators preying on those who are desperate to catch up. If you rush through things,
you will look back and wonder at all the mistakes you made that you could have avoided. Use time to your advantage when it comes to getting to know someone, or when it comes to understanding an investment. Predators like to instill fear in their prey by making them think that they are running out of time.</p>
    
    <p> You are not running out of time. Time is on your side. Use it wisely. If you pause to reflect every time you are faced with a decision, you will find yourself making much better decisions, and avoiding numerous traps laid for you by the predators circling around you.</p>

 Chapter 2: A Deep Dive into the Dark Triad In the field of psychology, there is a phenomenon referred to as the dark triad. The dark triad is a set of three personality traits, namely narcissism,
Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. This set of three is referred to as dark because of the typically malignant behaviors associated with these traits.
The stark contrast of the dark triad is the light triad, which in itself is a topic and discussion for another book.</p>
    
    <p> While the three traits represented on the dark triad are distinct on their own studies, it is show that in reality they often overlap. What this means is that a person who scores highly on the dark triad test will likely have all of these traits present with blurred boundaries. For instance, it might be difficult to tell where narcissism stops,
and psychopathy starts.
Discussions about the concept of the dark triad were initially started in 1998 by three psychology experts (names to be included) who argued that narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy occurred in an overlapping manner in normal samples.</p>
    
    <p> Later on, in 2002, two psychologists by the names of Paulhus and Williams would coin a name for this concept: the dark triad.
In trying to understand the personalities of the dark triad, discussions, and debates have often ensued regarding the role played by nature and nature.
To put it simply, behavioral scientists, psychologists, and researchers have been keen to understand whether dark triad persons are born or bred. Are we born evil and manipulative, or do we become so as a result of the things we are exposed to as we grow up? According to numerous researches conducted, it has been noted that the dark triad has a significant genetic component to it.</p>
