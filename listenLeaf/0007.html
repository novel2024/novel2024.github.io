    <p> “What do we do when we want tostrengthen our muscles? We make them work hard every day, do we not?”Kellogg inquired of his intended youthful readership. “The exercise makes themgrow large and strong. It is just the same with our brains. If we study hard andlearn our lessons well, then our brains grow strong and study becomes easy.</p>
    
    <p>”Entrenched historical foundations support these metaphors; they rest upondeep cultural underpinnings as well. The computer and muscle analogies fitneatly with our society’s emphasis on individualism—its insistence that weoperate as autonomous, self-contained beings, in possession of capacities andcompetencies that are ours alone. These comparisons also readily conform to ourculture’s penchant for thinking in terms of good, better, best. Scientist andauthor Stephen Jay Gould once included in his list of “the oldest issues anderrors of our philosophical traditions” our persistent inclination “to order itemsby ranking them in a linear series of increasing worth.</p>
    
    <p>” Computers may be slowor fast, muscles may be weak or strong—and so it goes, we assume, with ourown and others’ minds.There even appear to be hard-wired psychological factors underlying ourembrace of these ideas about the brain. The belief that some core quantity ofintelligence resides within each of our heads fits with a pattern of thought,apparently universal in humans, that psychologists call “essentialism”—that is,the conviction that each entity we encounter possesses an inner essence thatmakes it what it is. “Essentialism shows up in every society that has beenstudied,” notes Yale University psychology professor Paul Bloom.</p>
    
    <p> “It appears tobe a basic component of how we think about the world.” We think in terms ofenduring essences—rather than shifting responses to external influences—because we find such essences easier to process mentally, as well as moresatisfying emotionally. From the essentialist perspective, people simply “are”intelligent or they are not.Together, the historical, cultural, and psychological bases of our assumptionsabout the mind—that its properties are individual, inherent, and readily rankedaccording to quality—give them a powerful punch.</p>
    
    <p> Such assumptions haveprofoundly shaped the views we hold on the nature of mental activity, on theconduct of education and work, and on the value we place on ourselves andothers. It’s therefore startling to contemplate that the whole lot of it could bemisconceived. To grasp the nature of this error, we need to consider anothermetaphor.ON THE MORNING of April 18, 2019, computer screens went dark across a swathof Seoul, South Korea’s largest city.</p>
    
    <p> Lights flickered out in schools and officesacross the 234-square-mile metropolis, home to some 10 million people.Stoplights at street intersections blinked off, and electric-powered trains slowedto a halt. The cause of the blackout was as small in scale as its effects werewidespread: a power outage caused by magpies, the black-and-white-featheredbirds who build their nests on utility poles and transmission towers. Magpies—members of the corvid family, which also includes crows, jays, and ravens—arewell known for making their nests out of whatever is available in theenvironment.</p>
    
    <p> The birds have been observed using an astonishing array ofmaterials: not only twigs, string, and moss, but also dental floss, fishing line, andplastic Easter grass; chopsticks, spoons, and drinking straws; shoelaces, eyeglassframes, and croquet wickets. During the American Dust Bowl of the 1930s,which eliminated vegetation from huge swaths of the West, magpies’ corvidcousins made nests out of barbed wire.The densely packed urban neighborhoods of modern-day Seoul feature fewtrees or bushes, so magpies use what they can find: metal clothes hangers, TVantennas, and lengths of steel wire. These materials conduct electricity—and so,when the birds build their nests on the city’s tall electrical transmission towers,the flow of electricity is regularly disrupted.</p>
    
    <p> According to KEPCO, the KoreaElectric Power Corporation, magpies are responsible for hundreds of powerElectric Power Corporation, magpies are responsible for hundreds of poweroutages annually in areas all across the country. Each year, KEPCO employeeswork to remove upwards of ten thousand nests, but just as quickly the magpiesbuild them up again.Magpies may pose a headache for power companies, but their activity suppliesa felicitous analogy for the way the mind works. Our brains, it might be said, arelike magpies, fashioning their finished products from the materials around them,weaving the bits and pieces they find into their trains of thought.</p>
    
    <p> Set beside thebrain-as-computer and brain-as-muscle metaphors, it’s apparent that the brain asmagpie is a very different kind of analogy, with very different implications forhow mental processes operate. For one thing: thought happens not only insidethe skull but out in the world, too; it’s an act of continuous assembly andreassembly that draws on resources external to the brain. For another: the kindsof materials available to “think with” affect the nature and quality of the thoughtthat can be produced. And last: the capacity to think well—that is, to beintelligent—is not a fixed property of the individual but rather a shifting statethat is dependent on access to extra-neural resources and the knowledge of howto use them.</p>
    
    <p>This is, admittedly, a radically new way of thinking about thinking. It may notfeel easy or natural to adopt. But a growing mass of evidence generated withinseveral scientific disciplines suggests that it’s a much more accurate rendering ofhow human cognition actually works. Moreover, it’s a gratifyingly generativeconceptualization, because it offers so many practical opportunities forimproving how well we think.</p>
