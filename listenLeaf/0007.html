    <p> “So clever is the device,” he wrote, “that its creators have given up trying to find problems so long that they cannot be solved.” The introduction of the ENIAC was not just a milestone in the history of technology. It was a turning point in the story of how we understand ourselves.
In its early days, Mauchly and Eckert’s invention was frequently compared to a human brain.</p>
    
    <p> Newspaper and magazine articles described the ENIAC as a “giant electronic brain,” a “robot brain,” an “automatic brain,” and a “brain machine.” But before long, the analogy got turned around. It became a commonplace that the brain is like a computer. Indeed, the “cognitive revolution” that would sweep through American universities in the 1950s and 1960s was premised on the belief that the brain could be understood as a flesh-and-blood computing machine.</p>
    
    <p> The first generation of cognitive scientists “took seriously the idea that the mind is a kind of computer,” notes Brown University professor Steven Sloman. “Thinking was assumed to be a kind of computer program that runs in people’s brains.” Since those early days at the dawn of the digital age, the brain-computer analogy has become only more pervasive and more powerful, engaged not just by researchers and academics but by the rest of us, the public at large. The metaphor provides us with a model, sometimes conscious but often implicit, of how thinking works.</p>
    
    <p> The brain, according to this analogy, is a self-contained information-processing machine, sealed inside the skull as the ENIAC was sequestered in its locked room. From this inference emerges a second: the human brain has attributes, akin to gigabytes of RAM and megahertz of processing speed, that can be easily measured and compared. Following on these is the third and perhaps most significant supposition of all: that some brains, like some computers, are just better; they possess the biological equivalent of more memory storage, greater processing power, higher-resolution screens.
To this day, the computer metaphor dominates the way we think and talk about mental activity—but it’s not the only one that shapes our notion of the brain.</p>
    
    <p> A half-century after the ENIAC was unveiled, another analogy rose to prominence.
 “NEW RESEARCH SHOWS That the Brain Can Be Developed Like a Muscle,” read the headline of the news article, set in bold type. The year was 2002, and Lisa Blackwell, a graduate student at Columbia University working with psychology professor Carol Dweck, was handing out copies of the article to a classroom full of seventh-graders at a public school in New York City. Dweck and Blackwell were testing a new theory, investigating the possibility that the way we conceptualize the brain can affect how well we think.</p>
    
    <p> The study’s protocol required Blackwell to guide the students through eight informational sessions; in this, the third session in the sequence, students were to take turns reading the text of the article aloud.
“Many people believe that a person is born either smart, average, or dumb— and stays that way,” one student began. “But new research shows that the brain is more like a muscle—it changes and gets stronger when you use it.” Another student picked up the thread: “Everyone knows that when you lift weights, your muscles get bigger and you get stronger.</p>
    
    <p> A person who can’t lift 20 pounds when they start exercising can get strong enough to lift 100 pounds after working out for a long time. That’s because the muscles become larger and stronger with exercise. And when you stop exercising, the muscles shrink and you get weaker. That’s why people say, ‘Use it or lose it!’ ” A giggle rippled through the room.</p>
    
    <p> “But,” a third pupil read on, “most people don’t know that when they practice and learn new things, parts of their brain change and get larger, a lot like muscles do when they exercise.” Dweck’s idea, which she initially called “the incremental theory of intelligence,” would eventually become known to the world as the “growth mindset”: the belief that concerted mental effort could make people smarter, just as vigorous physical effort could make people stronger. As she and her colleagues wrote in an account of their early research in schools, “The key message was that learning changes the brain by forming new connections, and that students are in charge of this process.” From these beginnings, growth mindset became a popular phenomenon—spawning a book, Mindset, that has sold millions of copies, and inspiring an untold number of speeches,
presentations, and workshops, delivered to corporate and organizational audiences as well as to students and teachers.</p>
