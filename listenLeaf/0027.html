    <p> It involves getting people to agree to a larger request by first testing the waters with smaller requests.   If you want to execute this technique cleverly, you will need to condition your target to be consistent in their responses to your request. For example, if you want your employee to work the weekend shift, you might first want to get them to agree to work the overnight shift--or vice versa depending on which is the least preferred shift in your business.
 The Principle of Liking If a person likes you, they are more likely to meet your demands, whatever this may be.</p>
    
    <p> A person that is not liked and is unlikeable as well will hear no more times than a person that is well-liked. But how do you go about getting people to like you? According to science, the secret to being liked is a combination of three main factors. First, people like those who are similar to them. For you to appear similar to the person you are hoping to persuade,
you must find common ground with them.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, many foreigners have learned that the simplest way to become more likable is by learning and speaking the local language. The other thing that you need to be aware of when making yourself more likable is flattery. Flattery will open many doors for you if you use it well. People like people who pay them compliments.</p>
    
    <p> If you want to ask someone to do something for you, start first by paying them a genuine-sounding compliment. Just because it’s called flattery does not mean that you must be effusive about it. In fact,
being too excessive in your praise will be counterproductive to your need to be liked. Last but not least, be the kind of person that is usually agreeable and cooperative towards the achievement of mutual goals, and you’ll be one step closer to being likable.</p>
    
    <p> If you are always stepping on other people’s toes in order to get what you want, you will have very few friends, and this will not help your case when you need to persuade someone in future.
Remember, being agreeable and cooperative does not entail being a doormat. Sometimes, it just means putting in some little effort that helps a person achieve a goal that is significant to them. For instance, if a colleague is struggling with a due report, offer to assist them with the printing and mailing.</p>
    
    <p> It is not a whole lot of work, but you will go from the uninvolved,
nondescript colleague to the likable colleague that is kind and helpful. Later on, you can cash this chip as you so wish.
The Principle of Authority A person who is an authority figure in a particular field will have an easier time influencing other when compared to a complete newbie. If you wish to persuade more people to do a particular thing, you must build your credibility by making yourself seem like you have expertise in whatever field you are playing in.</p>
    
    <p> This principle is a key reason why professionals display their diplomas in their field. Think about it--when you walk into a therapist’s office, for instance, you are likely to consciously look out for the type of credentials they have hung on their walls. If it so happens that your therapist has a whole lot of credentials displayed, you will likely feel a sense of comfort in their expertise and experience. As such, any recommendations they have for you will be easily welcomed and implemented by you.</p>
    
    <p> The therapist, in essence, has managed to influence you without even saying a word.
It is a fact that your authority will not be taken very seriously if you are the only one talking about it. As such, you must ensure that you recruit others to beat the drums on your behalf, so to speak. There are subtle ways of doing this.</p>
