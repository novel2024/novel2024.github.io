    <p> Future payments of debt and interest are then made using the higher revenue. This shifts the cost of money from a less productive present to a more productive future and allows the business to earn profit faster and earn more profit compared to a business that operates without debt.15 Mortgage, car-loans, and consumer debt Unlike businesses, consumers rarely use debt to invest and generate an income. Instead, they use debt to purchase consumables like vehicles,
houses, furniture, and electronics, which don't generate income.</p>
    
    <p> In this case,
interest is no longer the cost of doing business. It's now the cost of living beyond one's means. This cost ranges from typical mortgage rates to typical credit card rates multiplied by the outstanding debt. Over the lifetime of a consumer this adds up to substantial amounts of money.</p>
    
    <p> Consider a typical six percent mortgage that runs 30 years. Here the total interest over the years is ~105% on top of the cost of the home. For those who are just starting their repayment, interest and finance charges comprise almost all of the monthly payment--home equity is mainly built towards the end of the repayment. It's very hard to become wealthy and financially independent this way, and predominantly making interest payments is more accurately thought of as paying rent while being responsible for all the expenses associated with home ownership.</p>
    
    <p>
All debt comes with a contractual obligation of repayment, which is usually structured to last 30 years to minimize individual monthly payments, but definitely not to minimize the total number of payments,
which is maximized by increasing the maturity of the loan as much as possible. If the maturity is extended in perpetuity, the interest payments become similar to rent. If the only means of repayment is a job, this means that working must also last at least 30 years. This way, a single decision just after leaving school turns into a lifelong commitment that can be very hard to escape, given that the borrowed money has been spent on increasing consumption rather than increasing production.</p>
    
    <p>
Most major consumption is financed. This means that money spent on major consumption has not been earned by those who spend it. This has a drastic consequence for the way the market sets the price level of anything that can be financed,16 and today, anything--even a fast food meal at a burger franchise--can be financed through unsecured credit. Specifically,
things are priced not according to how much money people have saved, but how large a monthly payment borrowers and lenders think can be made in the future.</p>
    
    <p> This is set by the interest rate, which is partially manipulated by the government, and credit ratings, which are partially manipulated by individual consumers, lenders, and credit rating agencies. These facts change the way people think of money. What you have saved becomes less important than what you can potentially borrow.
The consequence is that the cost in terms of hours worked is no longer fully appreciated, and people work and spend more--sometimes far more-- than they would if they paid cash, counting on being able to pay it back in the future or rolling over the debt, thus being forever locked in.</p>
    
    <p> Many even spend so much that they can't pay it back, leading to misallocated resources which could have been spent more fairly by those who earned the money.
The systemic consequence of this waste is that prices in a debt-driven society are higher than they would be in a cash-driven society, simply because more money (credit) is chasing the goods. This leads to bubbles and crashes due to credit being either too cheap or too expensive, and a psychological lag leading to a bipolar economy of alternating optimism and pessimism.17 It would appear that economists, or the effective majority of individuals who engage in lending and borrowing, haven't yet been able to perfectly model future demand and supply, and thus an economy that is built on predictions of future demand and supply (by the pricing of future payments in the form of the interest rate) is inherently unstable.</p>
    
    <p>
Ideally, personal finance shifts cash flows around in time so that money is available when it's most wanted and paid back when it's least wanted.
However, this shifting comes at a price in terms of fees and interest charges.
In particular, many people who don't know any better will simply make the standard choice, which effectively involves contractual obligations to work all of their life in exchange for houses, vehicles, furniture, electronics, and other stuff. To wit, a salary or even the potential of a future salary seems to be a gateway to the debt drug; so many people could probably reduce the risk of getting into debt by simply quitting their jobs.</p>
