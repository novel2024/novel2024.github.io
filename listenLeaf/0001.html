Conclusion References  Chapter 1: Dark Psychology 101 In a utopian world, all human beings would look out for each other.
Neighbors would be friends, colleagues in the corporate world would not be cutthroat in their competitiveness, and strangers would all be kind. There would be no theft, kidnappings, or even murder. There would just be perfect happiness and harmony.</p>
    
    <p> You could go about your business without worrying that someone was trying to take advantage of you. You could leave your bank cards unattended because nobody would be trying to steal from you. Sleeping with your windows and doors open would be the norm.
Identity theft would not exist.</p>
    
    <p> Jails would become obsolete, and women could walk in the dark without worrying about getting attacked.
Unfortunately, this is not the kind of world we live in.
In the real world, people use and abuse each other all the time. It almost seems that there is always someone waiting to take advantage of you at every turn.</p>
