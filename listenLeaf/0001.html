Asset management Investment science Epilogue References Footnotes About the book I think of this book first and foremost as a philosophy book about strategy. Like most philosophical books, it's voluminous compared to its content because much of it is dedicated to (re)defining underlying concepts and fundamentals, trying to find the words to describe something that isn't automatically implied by the usual understanding1 of the words used. The lack of concrete specifics is intentional because they won't pertain to very many people. The approach is deliberately open-ended to make the concepts applicable to as many different situations as possible.</p>
    
    <p> This may also mean that the concepts, which aim to create consilient and resilient structures, are applicable to other kinds of organizing like policy-making or business management.
This book isn't a "how-to" manual to a specific lifestyle, but a "how-to" manual for "how-to" manuals. The intention is for each person to create his own strategy. In this sense, this book isn't a travel journal, nor is it a set of map directions; it's a book that teaches you to become a navigator.</p>
    
    <p> I used the principles in this book to reduce my expenses to a quarter of the average person and become financially independent in five years. While my story may be entertaining or inspiring, it may not be directly useful towards reaching a similar goal. Similarly, while initially motivating due to their actionable form, a set of map directions would fail the first time one reaches a crossroads not on the map. This would end the journey if the "pilot" has no navigational skills.</p>
