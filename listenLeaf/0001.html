Theycajole and insist, they argue and debate, they issue warnings and pass judgment;as you lay out their recommendations for the reader, they inquire pointedly: Areyou taking your own advice?I entered into one such intimate exchange when I read, with a jolt ofrecognition, a passage written more than 130 years ago; it was as if the authorwere reaching through the pages that lay open on my desk. Making the meetingmore intense, the writer in question was a distinctly intimidating character: theGerman philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, he of the severe gaze and vaguelysinister mustache.“How quickly we guess how someone has come by his ideas,” Nietzsche slylyobserved, “whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinchedbelly, his head bowed low over the paper—in which case we are quickly finishedwith his book, too! Cramped intestines betray themselves—you can bet on that—no less than closet air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.</p>
    
    <p>”The room in which I was writing suddenly seemed rather airless and small.I encountered his words as I was working on a chapter about how bodilymovement affects the way we think. The quote from Nietzsche appears in a booktitled A Philosophy of Walking, by the contemporary French philosopherFrédéric Gros; Gros has his own thoughts to add. Don’t think of a book asissuing only from an author’s head, he advises.</p>
    
    <p> “Think of the scribe’s body: hishands, his feet, his shoulders and legs. Think of the book as an expression ofphysiology. In all too many books the reader can sense the seated body, doubledup, stooped, shriveled in on itself.”My seated body shifted guiltily in its chair, which it had occupied all morning.</p>
    
    <p>Far more conducive to the act of creation, Gros continues, is “the walkingbody”—which, he says, is “unfolded and tensed like a bow: opened to widespaces like a flower to the sun.” Nietzsche, he reminds us, wrote that we should“sit as little as possible; do not believe any idea that was not born in the open airand of free movement.”The philosophers were ganging up on me; I closed my laptop and went for awalk.I was acting not only on their say-so, of course; by this point in my research Ihad read dozens of empirical studies showing that a bout of physical activitysharpens our attention, improves our memory, and enhances our creativity.</p>
    
    <p> Andin fact, I found that the forward movement of my legs, the flow of images pastmy eyes, the slight elevation of my heart rate did work some kind of change onmy mind. Upon sitting back down at my desk, I wasted no time resolving aknotty conceptual problem that had tormented me all morning. (I can only hopethat the prose I produced also “retains and expresses the energy, the springinessof the body,” in Gros’s formulation.) Could my brain have solved the problemon its own, or did it require the assist provided by my ambulatory limbs?Our culture insists that the brain is the sole locus of thinking, a cordoned-offspace where cognition happens, much as the workings of my laptop are sealedinside its aluminum case.</p>
    
    <p> This book argues otherwise: it holds that the mind issomething more like the nest-building bird I spotted on my walk, plucking a bitof string here, a twig there, constructing a whole out of available parts. Forhumans these parts include, most notably, the feelings and movements of ourbodies; the physical spaces in which we learn and work; and the other mindswith which we interact—our classmates, colleagues, teachers, supervisors,friends. Sometimes all three elements come together in especially felicitousfashion, as they did for the brilliant intellectual team of Amos Tversky andDaniel Kahneman. The two psychologists carried out much of theirgroundbreaking work on heuristics and biases—the human mind’s habitualshortcuts and distortions—by talking and walking together, through the bustlingstreets of Jerusalem or along the rolling hills of the California coast.</p>
    
    <p> “I did thebest thinking of my life on leisurely walks with Amos,” Kahneman has said.Many tomes have been written on human cognition, many theories proposedand studies conducted (Tversky and Kahneman’s among them). These effortshave produced countless illuminating insights, but they are limited by theirassumption that thinking happens only inside the brain. Much less attention hasbeen paid to the ways people use the world to think: the gestures of the hands,the space of a sketchbook, the act of listening to someone tell a story, or the taskof teaching someone else.</p>
