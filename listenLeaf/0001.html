They cajole and insist, they argue and debate, they issue warnings and pass judgment;
as you lay out their recommendations for the reader, they inquire pointedly: Are you taking your own advice?
I entered into one such intimate exchange when I read, with a jolt of recognition, a passage written more than 130 years ago; it was as if the author were reaching through the pages that lay open on my desk. Making the meeting more intense, the writer in question was a distinctly intimidating character: the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, he of the severe gaze and vaguely sinister mustache.
“How quickly we guess how someone has come by his ideas,” Nietzsche slyly observed, “whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinched belly, his head bowed low over the paper—in which case we are quickly finished with his book, too! Cramped intestines betray themselves—you can bet on that —no less than closet air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.</p>
    
    <p>” The room in which I was writing suddenly seemed rather airless and small.
I encountered his words as I was working on a chapter about how bodily movement affects the way we think. The quote from Nietzsche appears in a book titled A Philosophy of Walking, by the contemporary French philosopher Frédéric Gros; Gros has his own thoughts to add. Don’t think of a book as issuing only from an author’s head, he advises.</p>
    
    <p> “Think of the scribe’s body: his hands, his feet, his shoulders and legs. Think of the book as an expression of physiology. In all too many books the reader can sense the seated body, doubled up, stooped, shriveled in on itself.” My seated body shifted guiltily in its chair, which it had occupied all morning.</p>
    
    <p>
Far more conducive to the act of creation, Gros continues, is “the walking body”—which, he says, is “unfolded and tensed like a bow: opened to wide spaces like a flower to the sun.” Nietzsche, he reminds us, wrote that we should “sit as little as possible; do not believe any idea that was not born in the open air and of free movement.” The philosophers were ganging up on me; I closed my laptop and went for a walk.
I was acting not only on their say-so, of course; by this point in my research I had read dozens of empirical studies showing that a bout of physical activity sharpens our attention, improves our memory, and enhances our creativity.</p>
    
    <p> And in fact, I found that the forward movement of my legs, the flow of images past my eyes, the slight elevation of my heart rate did work some kind of change on my mind. Upon sitting back down at my desk, I wasted no time resolving a knotty conceptual problem that had tormented me all morning. (I can only hope that the prose I produced also “retains and expresses the energy, the springiness of the body,” in Gros’s formulation.) Could my brain have solved the problem on its own, or did it require the assist provided by my ambulatory limbs?
Our culture insists that the brain is the sole locus of thinking, a cordoned-off space where cognition happens, much as the workings of my laptop are sealed inside its aluminum case.</p>
