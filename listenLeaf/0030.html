    <p> If you want to win at persuasion,
you must be an interesting person. The good news is that there are countless ways of being interesting.Â  You just need to identify something unique about yourself and amplify it for the world to see. It could be a skill or a hobby that you are really good at.</p>
    
    <p> It might also be your sense of humor or the way you dress. Perhaps, you might even want to share your unique view of the world with your audience. Whatever it is that you opt for, make sure that it helps people remember you long after the conversation ends.
Tip #6: Listen more than you talk You might think that being persuasive means doing a whole lot of talking,
but this could not be further from the truth.</p>
    
    <p> In order to influence people,
you must train yourself to be a good listener. Listening skills serve two purposes. First, as long as people are talking and you are listening, then it means you are gathering crucial information that you can use to your advantage. Second, people like a good listener.</p>
    
    <p> Why? Because people love talking about themselves. Keep your mouth shut and your ears open and you will be well on your way to increasing your likeability quotient. If you do not believe that this is important when it comes to influencing others,
refer to the principle of liking as discussed in the previous section.
Types of Deception and How to Get Better at All of Them Deception comes in various forms, all of which are intended to throw a subject off the truth.</p>
    
    <p> At the beginning of this chapter, we defined deception as the act of causing someone to believe something that is not valid or true.
In this section, we will explore the different ways through which you can deceive someone, how to get better at these methods, and how to protect yourself against deception in your everyday life.
  Lies Lies are the most popular form of deception. They are used every day during small talk, meetings, in relationships, in transactions, when you want to get out of an awkward situation, and in just about any type of conversation or circumstance.</p>
    
    <p> A lie is quite simply a statement that is the direct opposite of the truth. An example of a lie would be telling your boss that your grandmother has passed away so that you can get compassionate leave when in fact your grandmother is very much alive, and you just want a day off. Lies are easy to tell--you just need to find the contrast of the truth and tell it.
Equivocations An equivocation refers to the use of a particular word or phrase to change the meaning of a sentence, in order to knowingly shift the intended message.</p>
    
    <p> Equivocations are hardly used in everyday conversations,
although some clever person might find a way to weave them into their deceitful web. Equivocations are essentially wordplay. They fall under the broader term of the fallacy, which is defined as faulty reasoning, which is intended to make an argument seem better than it actually is.
Examples of equivocations include the following:
Dating my boyfriend is a real headache.</p>
    
    <p> Aspirin can make headaches go away, so maybe I should take an aspirin to make my boyfriend leave.
I have a right to free speech. Therefore, it is right for me to say what is on my mind at all times.
Equivocations are often a great source of funny jokes that you can tell at every opportunity.</p>
