    <p> It comes from people having decided that rather than using the time-saving technology and inventions that appeared around the first half of the 20th century to live a life of leisure, they would live a life of shopping and work until they could no longer function as useful--that is, income-earning--units in the production chain and had to be set aside.
With the institutionalization of society, where work and life and practically any and all activities are separated in space as well as time,
people who were institutionalized as children are inclined to institutionalize their aging parents in retirement homes in return (see here). At these retirement homes, retirees spend their time doing the equivalent of after- school activities, with the family dropping in during major holidays, if they can find the time. This is considered normal.</p>
    
    <p>
Those who have accumulated a large amount of savings earlier than everybody else thanks to uncommonly high savings rates or stock options sometimes take early retirement. This kind of early retirement resembles a long vacation, which is essentially what it is. The retiree has no immediate plans to be productive, and if he did, he would just go back to his old job where his earning power presumably would be highest. Instead, money is spent flying to exotic destinations, sporting events, or far-flung friends and relatives, although golf, fishing, motorboating, and other nonstrenuous physical activities have gained some popularity.</p>
    
    <p> Although relatively rare-- after all, there can only be so many financially independent people in a society--this is the kind of early retirement most people are familiar with and dream about, the kind of retirement that revolves around spending money.
Breaking out People stuck in their traditional ways of thinking often believe that the path to freedom and happiness lies in earning a little more money than they currently earn, regardless of how much they earn. However, despite our productivity--and, hence, our earnings--having doubled compared to two generations ago, I doubt anyone feels freer or happier about their earnings.
The real problem is not how much we earn; it's how much we waste,
perhaps to demonstrate our supposed wealth, when we spend it.</p>
    
    <p> As our productivity has gone up, we've increased the size of our homes and filled unused rooms with unused purchases, which just wait to be thrown out or given away. We're surrounded by the inedible landscapes of lawns and asphalt. We've moved far away from work and the market so we can waste time driving there, and money on maintaining our multiple cars. In our spare time we waste time watching TV, waste our bodies eating junk food,
then waste money treating the results of those habits.</p>
    
    <p> These behaviors make no one better off, except those who sell the enabling products, who, as mentioned above, are often ourselves.
We have counteracted our increased productivity at work with an equivalently decreased productivity at home, and consequently we're no better off than before, except we work much harder and waste more resources. It should be clear that we don't make trees grow taller or better by planting more of them, as long as we keep cutting them down, but this is exactly the philosophy that is driving our current behavior.
Anyone with access to rich resources has two choices: turn those resources into waste or turn them into wealth; that is, they can be consumers or producers (see Foundations of economics and finance).</p>
    
    <p> What happened after industrialization took hold was that a few people became wealthy, ruthlessly eliminating waste by focusing on efficiency. Many more people started prodigally wasting the abundance of resources and goods that were suddenly at their disposal. This has now turned into a collaborative/exploitative arrangement, where a few get wealthy selling waste to the many, while the many are employed in arrangements in which they have little control over what they produce. Often, their only idea is to work harder and be more productive, or somehow join the few by finding a clever way to cash in on selling wasteful, low-value products and services.</p>
    
    <p>
As previously remarked, "It is impossible to solve a problem with the same kind of thinking that created it." Yet this is exactly what we're trying to do again and again. You don't make a poorly designed engine run better by making it bigger (or smaller for that matter). The reason we do so anyway is that we don't know how to redesign it or that there are too many vested interests who benefit from not having it redesigned.</p>
    
    <p>
Recent years have seen many proposals for such designs. Some designs are social, requiring everybody to change; some designs are individual, but require the rest of society to stay the same lest they fail; and some designs,
like the one in this book, work either way and thus remain robust while being immediately actionable. In the last case the social design will emerge from the widespread adaption of the individual design, as likely or unlikely as that may be.
The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars.</p>
