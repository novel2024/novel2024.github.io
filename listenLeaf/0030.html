    <p> One feeds the other,” an actor observed in one of their interviews.
In a study they conducted in 2000, the Noices gathered together six actors from a repertory company who had earlier performed together in a production of The Dining Room, by the American playwright A. R. Gurney Jr.</p>
    
    <p> In this scene from the play, adult siblings Arthur and Sally debate what to do with the contents of their parents’ house, which is being sold:
ARTHUR: You sure Mother doesn’t want this stuff in Florida?
SALLY: She hardly has room for what she’s got. She wants us to take turns. Without fighting.
ARTHUR: We’ll just have to draw lots then.</p>
    
    <p>
SALLY: Unless one of us wants something, and one of us doesn’t.
ARTHUR: We have to do it today.
ARTHUR: We have to do it today.
SALLY: Do you think that’s enough time to divide up a whole house?
ARTHUR: I have to get back, Sal.</p>
    
    <p> (He looks in the sideboard.) We’ll draw lots and then go through the rooms taking turns. (He brings out a silver spoon.) Here.</p>
    
    <p> We’ll use this salt spoon. (He shifts it from hand to hand behind his back, then holds out two fists.) Take your pick. You get the spoon, you get the dining room.</p>
    
    <p>
SALLY: You mean you want to start here?
ARTHUR: Got to start somewhere.
Even though the run of The Dining Room had ended five months earlier, and many of the actors had learned new roles since then, they still remembered the lines from Gurney’s play that had been accompanied onstage by movement or gestures (as when Arthur holds out the spoon to Sally). Lines they had delivered while standing or sitting still, the Noices discovered, were much more likely to be forgotten.
In other studies, the Noices have shown that connecting words to movements improves recall among people who are not actors—college students, for example, and older people residing in assisted living facilities.</p>
    
    <p> Most activities advertised to forestall age-related memory loss—such as crossword puzzles,
sudoku, and commercial brain-training programs like Lumosity—conform to our society’s brainbound model of how thinking works: users sit still and use their heads. By contrast, Helga and Tony Noice have found that moving the body makes an essential contribution to strengthening memory—and other mental capacities as well.
In a series of studies conducted with people aged sixty-five to eighty-five, the Noices instructed participants in professional acting techniques and then led them in the rehearsal and performance of theatrical scenes. Before and after the four-week-long program, they tested participants on general cognitive capacities like word memory, verbal fluency, problem solving, and handling daily tasks,
such as comparing nutrition labels, paying bills by check, and looking up phone numbers.</p>
    
    <p> Compared to people the same age who did not enroll in any program,
or who took part in activities that did not involve movement (an art appreciation class, for example), individuals who had participated in the theatrical program became mentally sharper. Participants were apparently able to borrow strategies they learned in acting class—such as linking movement to material to be remembered—and apply them to the activities of everyday life.
Similar results have been found among younger people; again, movement seems to be key to remembering. In a study of undergraduates published in 2001, for example, the Noices reported that the effects of physical movement “previously found after lengthy real-world rehearsal and repeated performances by professional actors could be produced by giving a few minutes of instruction to non-actors with little or no performing experience.</p>
