First, reduce waste and increase efficiency. It's possible to live with the same benefits as the rest of society for one quarter of what the average consumer spends. Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought. If widely adopted, the air will be cleaner, products will be built for easy maintenance, and things will last for decades.</p>
    
    <p> Many old businesses will shut down but be replaced by new businesses with a focus on quality and durability. People will have more time for each other. They will know the names of their neighbors.
Second, having significantly reduced expenses, invest the difference in businesses.</p>
    
    <p> If widely adopted, businesses producing obsolete things which are no longer in demand will shut down, but new ones will appear, and it's a lot easier to change investments than it is to change careers. Alternatively, those with greater control over their income can choose to work less at higher efficiencies and save the money for intermittent periods without income. This works well for small business owners or contractors, who can decide to only take on the most profitable work and stop working when they no longer need money. It's difficult to run a small-time business and make an average income, but it's easy to make a quarter of an average income through multiple income streams (see A modular design).</p>
    
    <p> It's a lot safer, too,
compared to the risk of losing a single income stream from a job. This is also useful in case the world as we know it ends and businesses and trade all break down. This has happened once in recorded history-- namely, the Dark Ages, (see Leaving the Dark Ages and Investing and reasonable return rates) and being widely skilled (see Human capital and necessary personal assets) is better insurance against such an event than being an expert in pushing buttons on an assembly line, or pushing papers or business plans at a desk.
Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work.</p>
    
    <p> If your work is really meaningful to you, you can keep working, knowing that you are living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to leave your job at any time. The latter in particular seems to make quite a difference in terms of what employees are willing to put up with or which customers business owners are willing to keep around. Initially, working at reducing waste will occupy some time,
but once the methods are learned, this won't take longer than the usual method of buying a gadget or hiring a professional. Instead, it's necessary to find something else to occupy your time with.</p>
    
    <p> I don't cover this in great detail, having never lacked the imagination to find activities that are meaningful to me. Currently, I spend my "retirement" volunteering on the board of a small nonprofit, tending our garden,
improving my hockey game, crewing in yacht races, learning how to repair mechanical watches and bicycles, blogging, and writing books such as this.
These three pillars can all be pursued simultaneously and they can interact synergistically. Each reinforces the other two, but none of them rely on the others.</p>
    
    <p> The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity.
Conversely, meaningful activities can often provide income in a way that reduces waste. In addition, savings allows one to invest in better quality-- for example, paying eight times as much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses.
Economic degrees of freedom To understand a system and its constraints, it is often helpful to identify degrees of freedom to see what possibilities exist within the system.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, a train has one degree of freedom: It can move forwards or backwards. A car has two degrees of freedoms. It can move forwards,
backwards, left, or right.18 However, when one degree of freedom has been hidden it can be difficult to identify it.</p>
