    <p>” The difference such minimal instruction made in participants’ ability to recall information, they noted, was “striking”: students who incorporated movement into their learning strategy remembered 76 percent of the material, while those who engaged in “deliberate memorization” recalled only 37 percent.
The implications of the Noices’ research are clear. First: information is better remembered when we’re moving as we learn it. This is the case even when the movement is not a literal enactment of the meaning of the information to be recalled but simply a movement of the body, meaningfully related to the information and made at the same time the information is absorbed.</p>
    
    <p> Second:
information that has become associated with a movement is better remembered when we can reproduce that same movement later, when we’re calling it up from memory. This may be possible in some situations—for example, when giving a speech for which we have practiced accompanying gestures—but moving while learning is still beneficial even when those movements can’t be replicated at the point of recall (during an exam, for instance).
Indeed, simply forming the intention to move in connection with a piece of information seems to tag that information with a mental marker of importance.
Our natural egocentric bias leads us to preferentially attend to and remember that information that we have connected in some way to ourselves: my intention, my body, my movement.</p>
    
    <p> Concluded Helga and Tony Noice in one of their academic articles, “One might paraphrase Descartes and say, ‘I move, therefore I remember.’ ” Moving while learning can help us to remember information more accurately.
It may also be the case that moving while learning can help us understand information differently: more deeply, “from the inside,” as it were. A stray comment from an undergraduate working in her lab got psychologist Sian Beilock—then an assistant professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio— wondering about the body’s role in the act of understanding.</p>
    
    <p> The student played on the university’s hockey team, and he mentioned to his professor that when watching hockey on television, he seemed to understand the action as it unfolded in a way that was different from that of his friends who had not been out on the ice.
Beilock and her colleagues designed a study to test his impression. First,
experimenters read action sequences drawn from hockey games (“The hockey player shot the puck”) and from everyday life (“The child saw the balloon in the air”) to two groups of study participants; one group was made up of experienced hockey players, while the other group had never played the sport. Then participants were shown pictures that either did or did not correspond to the action sequences they’d heard (for instance, an image depicting a child seeing a balloon in the air, or a child seeing a deflated balloon on the ground).</p>
    
    <p>
For each sentence-picture pair, all the participants were able to correctly identify whether the two matched or not—but when the action concerned a hockey game, the hockey players were much quicker than their non-playing counterparts to make the identification; they exhibited what Beilock calls “facilitated comprehension.” Brain scans conducted on both groups showed that a particular neural region was activated more strongly in the hockey players’ brains than in the non-players’ brains when they listened to hockey-specific language: the left dorsal premotor cortex, responsible for executing well- practiced physical movements. This area isn’t typically associated with language processing, but the players’ personal history with the game gave them a body- based experience that they could connect to the words they heard. The surprising import of Beilock’s study is that people who have moved in different ways go on to think in different ways—an insight that can be applied well beyond sports.</p>

The research on using movement to enhance thinking identifies four types of helpful motion: congruent movements, novel movements, self-referential movements, and metaphorical movements. The first of these, congruent movements, express in physical form the content of a thought. With the motions of our bodies, we enact the meaning of a fact or concept. Congruent movements are an effective way to reinforce still tentative or emerging knowledge by introducing a corporeal component into the process of understanding and remembering.</p>
    
    <p> A familiar example is moving the body along a number line:
children who are learning about math benefit from taking steps on an oversized number line placed on the floor as they count or as they carry out procedures like addition and subtraction. Moving their bodies up or down the number line is congruent with the mental operation of counting up or down; taking small steps is congruent with the mental operation of counting one unit at a time, while venturing a bigger leap is congruent with the mental operation of adding or subtracting a number of units at once. Students who practice connecting numbers with movements in this way later demonstrate more mathematics knowledge and skill.
Moving the body in ways congruent with thinking is beneficial in part because it helps students make the tricky transition from the concrete to the abstract.</p>
    
    <p> This is the challenge facing children when they first learn to read: they must forge connections between the solid stuff of the world and the abstract symbols we use to represent it. In everyday life, children typically encounter the word “ball” or “cup” when there’s an actual ball or cup around, notes Arthur Glenberg, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. But within the pages of a book, words must be understood in the absence of such real-world referents.
Glenberg uses congruent movement to bridge this gap.</p>
