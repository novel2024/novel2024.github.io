    <p> For example:
Two cannibals were eating a clown, and one turned to the other and said,
“Does this taste funny to you?” In all seriousness, though, equivocations are hardly your biggest worry when it comes to deception. At best, equivocations will bring you some laughter in your life; at worst, you are likely to end up confused, but only for a couple of minutes before you figure out what’s going on.
Concealments When you engage in concealment, you omit information for purposes of deceit. This is a preferred form of deception, especially since it is easy to get yourself off the hook if you are caught.</p>
    
    <p> You can simply explain yourself by saying that you forgot to reveal the particular fact. Concealments are sometimes referred to as lying by omission. Let’s say, for instance, that you are planning to buy a house. You know a good realtor, and you reach out to them with your specific requirements.</p>
    
    <p> The realtor has a few open units that fit your description, and you arrange for a site visit. Come the day of, you are impressed by this one particular unit that is conveniently located near your workplace, and spacious enough to accommodate you and your dogs.
You want to make an offer on it, but you just need one question answered:
why did the last owner give up the unit?
Your realtor tells you that the previous owners decided to move on to greener pastures after living in the unit for three years. However, the realtor conveniently omits the fact that the need for greener pastures was necessitated by the fact that property values are declining in the particular area that you want to buy your house in.</p>
    
    <p> By omitting this crucial fact, your realtor convinces you to buy the house. They did not tell an outright lie-- they simply refused to tell the whole truth. This is the concept behind concealments.
Exaggerations/Overstatements An exaggeration is a stretching of the truth.</p>
    
    <p> Some people do not like to tell the truth in its plain form as it sounds boring that way. Rather, they will embellish it to the point where it is hardly recognizable. An exaggeration or overstatement looks like this: your friend puts their money in a small-size investment that is giving them returns of $100 per week. Instead of your friend reporting accurately on their returns, he goes around telling everyone that he is making bucket loads of money from his investment.</p>
    
    <p> Depending on the economy you live in, $100 may be several cups of coffee and a nice meal or a quarter of the month’s rent, but it hardly the vacation-paying,
ready-to-retire fortune that your friend wants to make it seem. Yes, he is making money, but yes, he is also stretching the truth...</p>
    
    <p>perhaps to make you jealous.
Understatements Understatements are the direct opposite of overstatements. Understatements are also referred to as the minimization of truth and involve downplaying a truth so that it does not seem as bad as it actually is. Understatements are often used by people who are in denial about something, or those who want to rationalize an otherwise irrational decision that they have made.</p>
    
    <p> Abusers may also downplay the truth when confronted by or about their victims so that they can shed off some responsibility for their abuse.
Let’s say for example, that a couple who have been married for ten years mutually agree to have the husband run the finances of the household.
Confident in his wife’s business sense and financial acumen, the trusting wife contributes diligently to their investment kitty and lets the husband do all the investing. Unfortunately, the husband makes a few bad investments that wipe out all their money, leaving them with nothing but a few months’ paychecks.</p>
