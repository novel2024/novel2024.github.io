    <p> His conclusion is based on research like the following: A study that asked expert trauma surgeons to describe how they insert a shunt into the femoral artery (the large blood vessel in the upper leg) reported that the surgeons neglected to cite nearly 70 percent of the actions they performed during the procedure. A study of expert experimental psychologists found that they omitted or inaccurately characterized an average of 75 percent of the steps they took when designing experiments and analyzing data. And a study of expert computer programmers revealed that they enumerated fewer than half of the tasks they actually carried out when debugging a computer program.
Our systems of academic education and workplace training rely on experts teaching novices, but they rarely take into account the blind spots that experts acquire by virtue of being experts.</p>
    
    <p> In the era of knowledge work, it’s not only the case that learners and novices must become more assiduous imitators;
instructors and experts must also become more legible models. This can be accomplished through what philosopher Karsten Stueber calls “re-enactive empathy”: an appreciation of the challenges confronting the novice that is produced by reenacting what it was like to have once been a beginner oneself.
Ting Zhang, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, found a clever way to stage such a reenactment among expert musicians. For her experiment, Zhang enlisted a group of experienced guitarists to play their instruments; half of them were asked to play as they normally would, while the other half were instructed to reverse the position of their instrument and play it with their non-dominant hand.</p>
    
    <p> All the musicians were then asked to watch a video clip of a beginning guitar student trying to form basic chords, and to offer him advice. The guidance provided by the guitarists in the reversed instrument condition—those who had so recently struggled themselves to play in an unfamiliar manner—was judged to be especially helpful.
But reenacting the experience of being a novice need not be so literal; experts can generate empathy for the beginner through acts of the imagination, changing the way they present information accordingly. An example: experts habitually engage in “chunking,” or compressing several tasks into one mental unit.</p>
    
    <p> This frees up space in the expert’s working memory, but it often baffles the novice,
for whom each step is new and still imperfectly understood. A math teacher may speed through an explanation of long division, not remembering or recognizing that the procedures that now seem so obvious were once utterly inscrutable.
Math education expert John Mighton has a suggestion: break it down into steps,
then break it down again—into micro-steps, if necessary.
Though Mighton now holds a PhD in mathematics, he struggled with math as a child.</p>
    
    <p> He succeeded by teaching himself how to advance one tiny move at a time—the method he now advocates as the founder of a nonprofit educational organization, JUMP Math (the name stands for Junior Undiscovered Math Prodigies). When instructors make their expertise legible in this way, learners are able to master one small step, then another and another, acquiring a solid understanding and gaining confidence as they go. The approach has allowed many JUMP participants, including some who struggled to grasp the most basic mathematical concepts in school, to achieve proficiency in the subject. An evaluation of the JUMP program, conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto and Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children and published in 2019,
provides support for Mighton’s method.</p>
    
    <p> By the second year of the study, JUMP students in grade three had made greater progress in problem solving, and JUMP students in grade six had made greater gains across a broad range of mathematical skills—calculation, math fluency, and applied problems—than those who received traditional instruction.
Experts have another edge over novices: they know what to attend to and what to ignore. Presented with a professionally relevant scenario, experts will immediately home in on its most salient aspects, while beginners waste their time focusing on unimportant features. But research shows that the expertise of experienced practitioners can be made more accessible by deliberately experienced practitioners can be made more accessible by deliberately exaggerating it, even distorting it, such that the pertinent elements “pop out” for the novice as they do for the expert.</p>

A number of years ago, the US Air Force sought the advice of psychologist Itiel Dror, now a senior researcher at University College London. Endeavoring to prevent friendly fire aimed at their own aircraft, air force leaders were looking for ways to improve the ability of pilots in training to instantly recognize the shapes of various planes. Dror observed that the trainees were becoming overwhelmed with details about the many airplanes they were expected to identify. He took a new tack, digitally morphing the outlines of the aircraft diagrams the pilots were given to study.</p>
    
    <p> Planes with a wide wingspan became even wider; sharp-angled planes were made pointier; snub-nosed planes appeared more rounded. The differences among the aircraft, once subtle and hard to notice, now leaped out at the pilots—and they continued to recognize these distinguishing features even when they viewed the planes at normal scale.
Dror’s method is related to a phenomenon that psychologists call “the caricature advantage”: the fact that we recognize a caricatured face even more readily than we recognize a true-to-life depiction. While a caricature does distort its subject’s actual appearance, it does so in a systematic way, exaggerating what is unique or distinctive about that individual—thereby making him or her even more instantly identifiable.</p>
