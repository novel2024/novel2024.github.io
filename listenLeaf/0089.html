6. It has been more than a year since I used this (get rid of it!).
7. I did not even know I owned this?! (get rid of it!!) If you draw a histogram it might look something like this figure.</p>
    
    <p> Don't be surprised if you use fewer than three percent of your possessions daily and 90%+ of all possessions less than annually. This is a normal consumer pattern, but a waste of space and money.
The goal is to bunch the histogram up on the left-hand side, so that most possessions are used daily, with fewer possessions used weekly, only a few used monthly, and only a couple of keepsakes that rarely see any use.
Usually one's possessions will then fit into one or two suitcases (see Which things should I own?).</p>
    
    <p>
This graph shows a histogram that illustrates the number of possessions versus their usage. The x-axis shows the time since last use intervals and the y-axis shows the number of possessions in this category.
To make the transition, anything that falls outside of this pattern should go into storage. In the US people have so much stuff that one can rent commercial storage units.</p>
    
    <p> In other parts of the world one has to come to some sort of arrangement with people who will rent out attic or shed space or store things for free.
This process is most easily accomplished when relocating and things have to come out of the closet, perhaps seeing daylight for the first time in a long time. Plan on relocating to a smaller home. While packing, sort things into moving boxes according to the list above.</p>
    
    <p> Put categories 1-3 into a few suitcases--if you need more than that, you're probably cheating--and put the rest in boxes headed to storage.
Speaking of relocating to a smaller home, make sure to plan for things that are important to you. For instance, if you like to read, get a home close to the library. This way you can use the public library as your library rather than duplicating the books in your home.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, one of the strategies I've used is to check whether a book I own is available through the library. If it is, I sell it, swap it, or give it away.
If going through this process while staying in the same home, one will find a lot of space liberated. This will make cleaning and maintenance easier.</p>
    
    <p> It might also make you question why you live in such a big house (it looks so empty!). Please resist the temptation to fill the house with new stuff.
A more lengthy process is to get rid of things slowly rather than putting them into storage. I don't think this is an optimal solution; see Sigmoids,
logistic curves, and the maximum power principle for why.</p>
    
    <p> Most likely, the process will be too slow and will subsequently stall out of bitterness over the fact that things don't appear to change despite all efforts. The cost of moving slowly towards a goal is that one needs a long time to get anywhere. This requires more discipline and dedication. In other words,
there is a tradeoff between making sudden, large changes and being dedicated to incremental change.</p>
