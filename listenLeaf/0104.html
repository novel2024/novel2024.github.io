    <p> Also check options for car pooling.
If you live in a region with heavy winters, you may want to walk rather than ride a bike.72 In that case, limit your maximum distance to three miles (this will take about an hour to walk). If you have a bike option, I would say seven miles, tops.</p>
    
    <p> However, perhaps you're tougher than I am--some bike commuters ride more than 15 miles each way, every day. Walking a six mile round trip daily is certainly doable. I did it daily for half a year once, but I wouldn't want to walk much farther than that; it simply takes too much time.
Some may be presently bound by mortgages that are underwater (don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy) or by not having sufficient ready funds to make a deposit, in which case they may resort to just reconsidering or postponing the move.</p>
    
    <p> Even if you're not going to move, try going through the exercise anyway just to realize that it's possible. Don't worry, there are other ways to self-actualize and gain (self-)respect than living in expensive housing. Furthermore, in most vocations you'll rarely be keeping up appearances with anyone other than your neighbors.73 Your employer and clients will most likely not even know where you live, and your real friends won't care (see People).</p>

Telecommuting and work Moving your work to your home eliminates transportation to work and removes the constraint of living close to work. It's likely that it also removes other constraints, such as corporate hours and dress code, as well as inconvenient constraints such as not being able to drop work at a moment's notice if something else comes up. I prefer supplying products or services that can be sold locally, by mail or online, as this makes it easier to find customers.
Furthermore, if you work in a field with a high return on assets, that is,
your income is large relative to your investments in fixed assets, your fixed assets will be easy to move (or you make so much money that moving expenses are of no concern to you).</p>
    
    <p> Computer jobs only require a computer,
which is easily portable. Also consider watch repair, micromechanics,
microelectronics, accounting, tax assistance, and other jobs that don't require heavy machinery.
Instead of moving the work home to your shelter, also consider moving your shelter to where the work is. Contractors live in travel trailers that they pull around the country, living at low rents close to wherever the work is,
and they use their work trucks to pull the trailer.</p>

Domestic food supply There are three ways to supply your food domestically without having to leave home. The first method is to order in, either having ready-made food delivered to your door (expensive) or groceries delivered (also expensive, but maybe not as expensive as a car).
The second method is to buy in bulk. Shop for groceries once a month.</p>
    
    <p>
This will be similar to provisioning for a cruising boat, and books on cruising will offer detailed instructions for how to do this, even without the need for refrigeration. Alternatively, survival literature will provide plans for even longer food storage. The benefit of this method is that should something happen, you'll likely have food for a few or even several weeks,
depending on your buffer. If you want this kind of coverage, don't forget to store water.</p>
    
    <p> Mark everything with the buy date, eat the oldest first, and keep the store in rotation.
The third method is growing a majority of your own food. Being completely self-sufficient is economically inefficient. It would make economic sense to focus on crops that are expensive (tomatoes) and buy crops that are cheap (potatoes).</p>
