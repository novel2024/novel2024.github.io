    <p>” The navigator himself turned to the captain, seated on the port side of the pilothouse. “Captain, the engineer is losing steam on the boiler for no apparent cause,” he repeated.
Everyone present knew the message was urgent. Losing steam pressure effectively meant losing power throughout the ship.</p>
    
    <p> The consequences of this unexpected development soon made themselves evident. Just forty seconds after the engineer’s report, the steam drum had emptied, and all steam-operated systems ground to a halt. A high-pitched alarm sounded for a few seconds; then the bridge fell eerily quiet, as the electric motors in the radars and other devices spun down and stopped.
But losing electrical power was not the full extent of the emergency.</p>
    
    <p> A lack of steam meant the crew had no ability to slow the ship’s rate of speed. The ship was moving too fast to drop anchor. The only way to reduce its momentum would have been to reverse the ship’s propeller—operated, of course, by steam.
On top of that, loss of steam hobbled the crew’s ability to steer the ship, another consequence that soon became painfully evident.</p>
    
    <p> Gazing anxiously out over the bow of the ship, the navigator told the helmsman to turn the rudder to the right ten degrees. The helmsman spun the wheel, but to no effect.
“Sir, I have no helm, sir!” he exclaimed.
The helm did have a manual backup system: two men sweating in a compartment in the stern of the ship, exerting all their might to move the unyielding rudder even an inch.</p>
    
    <p> The navigator, still gazing out over the bow,
whispered, “Come on, damn it, swing!” But the seventeen-thousand-ton ship sailed on—now veering far off its original course and headed for the crowded San Diego Harbor.
Watching all of this unfold in real time was Edwin Hutchins. Hutchins was a psychologist employed by the Naval Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego. He had boarded the Palau as an observer conducting a study, taking notes and tape-recording conversations.</p>
    
    <p> Now the ship was roiled by a crisis—a “casualty,” in the crew’s lingo—and Hutchins was along for the ride.
From his corner of the pilothouse, Hutchins looked over at the crew’s leader.
The captain, he noted, was acting calm, as if all this were routine. In fact,
Hutchins knew, “the situation was anything but routine”: “The occasional cracking voice, a muttered curse, the removal of a jacket that revealed a perspiration-soaked shirt on this cool spring afternoon, told the real story: the Palau was not fully under control, and careers, and possibly lives, were in jeopardy.</p>
    
    <p>” Hutchins used his time aboard the ship to study a phenomenon he calls “socially distributed cognition,” or the way people think with the minds of others. His aim, he later wrote, was to “move the boundaries of the cognitive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the individual person and treat the navigation team as a cognitive and computational system.” Such systems,
Hutchins added, “may have interesting cognitive properties of their own.” Faced with a predicament that no single mind could resolve, the socially distributed cognition of the Palau’s crew was about to be put to the test.</p>
    
    <p>
Among the downstream effects of the steam-engine malfunction was the failure of the gyrocompass, the principal tool relied upon by the Palau’s navigation team. Without the gyrocompass, the team had to manually ascertain the position of the ship, calculating the relationship among bearings taken from multiple landmarks on shore. And because the Palau’s position was a moving target, this calculation had to be generated once every minute. The ship’s quartermaster chief, a man named Richards, got down to work at the chart table in the pilothouse—but it soon became clear that the job was too much for one brain to handle.</p>
