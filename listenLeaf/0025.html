    <p> "Work hard, play hard." Others attempt to create meaning through collecting; that is, a systematic form of hoarding. Entire industries have been created that appeal to the hoarding instinct, creating things to collect with no use value whatsoever. These things don't even have any intrinsic or collectible value,
but consumers collect them anyway and work hard to do so.</p>

For many, status is associated with expensive items thought to be fitting for someone with a higher salary. Certain jobs are associated with certain levels of spending. This means that the price itself is often considered a complementary good--the item is considered desirable simply because it's expensive. This locks one into a spiral of "upgrading": An expensive shirt leads to the purchase of an expensive suit; the car must match the expensive home.</p>
    
    <p> An increase in pay allows one to buy goods which previously seemed like a luxury. Another increase leads to another upgrade. Soon these become a normal part of life and people start identifying with them. When you identify with an object, you're defined by the object, then controlled by it, and ultimately owned by it.</p>
    
    <p> If you relate to your possessions, you're owned by your stuff, and it will make many of your decisions for you. This trap is not only mental, but also physical.
When moving into a new place, there's a tendency to rapidly fill all rooms with furniture (and TVs)--perhaps there's a taboo against empty rooms? Those extra rooms, which are rarely used--the so-called media rooms, the basement bar, the craftsroom--are then used for storage space and slowly fill with stuff that people "need" yet never use. In fact, in many houses, those rooms, like attached garages, serve no purpose other than storing unused stuff and furniture.</p>
    
    <p> This of course makes it challenging to move into somewhere smaller. In particular, the very idea of moving is rejected because it requires too much effort. So not only are people attached to their stuff, they're also attached to their homes.
Continuously accruing stuff soon makes any home too small, regardless of its size.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore much effort has gone into optimizing total square footage including repurposing the garage and parking the car on the street.
People don't seem to realize that the quest to bring more possessions in through the front door is a chronic disease, and that the shortage of space is a symptom rather than an underlying problem. Consequently, modern homes are mostly big, poorly constructed, poorly located, and financially leveraged. Like the big gas guzzlers used to drive back and forth to them,
they're very energy-intensive, and thus, in light of nascent resource constraints, are also outdated and old-fashioned.</p>

Ironically, buying things is often used as a "deserved" reward for hard work: "Why don't you go and buy yourself something nice?" The idea is that work is drudgery, so in order to ease the pain, the money earned working is spent on some gadget, thus requiring more work. This spiral makes little sense, so either work isn't so bad, or perhaps there is another reason for this behavior. One reason may be that many people are salaried full-time employees. They can't choose to work any less, so they might as well spend the superfluous money they earn.</p>
    
    <p>
As a result, no matter how much someone earns, expenses tend to match income. This is called lifestyle inflation. Without the wisdom to determine when enough is enough, consumption is taken to its extreme and people still work as much as ever, if not more, despite doubling their productivity over the past half century.
On the homefront the growing use of time-saving technology doesn't result in time saved either.</p>
