    <p> In recent years, however, researchers have begun to explore an exciting additional possibility: that single bouts of physical activity can enhance our cognition in the short term. By moving our bodies in certain ways, that is, we’re immediately able to think more intelligently. Scientists investigating this phenomenon have approached it from two different directions: the intensity of the movement and the type of movement. As we’ll soon see, low-, medium-, and high-intensity physical activity each exerts a distinct effect on our cognition.</p>
    
    <p> Later on in the chapter, we’ll explore how certain types of movement—congruent movements,
novel movements, self-referential movements, and metaphorical movements— can also extend our thinking beyond what is possible when we remain stationary.
The tight connection between thinking and moving is a legacy of our species’s evolutionary history. The human brain is approximately three times larger than it “should” be, given the dimensions of the human body; according to fossil evidence, a remarkable expansion in the size of the brain took place about 2 million years ago. Scientists have proposed various reasons for this increase,
such as the growing complexity of our forebears’ social interactions or the need to adapt to changing ecological conditions.</p>
    
    <p> Recently, another explanation has been put forth: “At the same time as brain size began to increase in the human lineage, aerobic activity levels appear to have changed dramatically,” notes David Raichlen, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Southern California. “Human ancestors transitioned from a relatively sedentary ape-like existence to a hunting and gathering lifestyle which required an increased amount of physical activity compared to earlier hominins.” Raichlen, who has conducted extensive studies of some of the world’s remaining hunter-gatherer tribes, points out that this way of life is both physically and cognitively demanding. Foraging requires vigorous, sustained physical activity; it also makes demands on attention, memory, spatial navigation, motor control, and executive functions like planning and decision making.</p>
    
    <p> Hunting, too, poses both a mental and a physical challenge: the hunter has to locate the animal and track its unpredictable movements even while mustering the energy to outrun it. Such are the conditions under which the unique human brain evolved. The dual demands of physical challenge and cognitive complexity shaped our special status as Homo sapiens; to this day,
bodily activity and mental acuity are still intimately intertwined.
Of course, things have changed for those of us who live in modern societies;
we are no longer a species on the move.</p>
    
    <p> While the Hazda people of East Africa —one of the hunter-gatherer tribes studied by Raichlen—spend an average of 135 minutes a day engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity, most inhabitants of industrialized countries fail to meet health experts’ minimum recommendation of 150 minutes of activity a week. Put another way,
contemporary hunter-gatherers engage in more than fourteen times as much moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as the typical American. The lack of physical movement in our society is due in large part to the dominance of academic learning and of knowledge work, and to the habits and convictions that have grown up around these endeavors. While we’re thinking, we believe, we should be sitting still.</p>
    
    <p>
Challenges to this belief may be met with derision. When Jeff Fidler published his findings in the Journal of the American College of Radiology,
some of his colleagues reacted with mocking ridicule. “I see that I can depend on this publication for comic relief,” wrote Robert Feld, a radiologist from Hartford,
Connecticut, in a letter to the editor. Fidler’s study, he declared, was “a parody of clinical research gone awry”; in Feld’s view, making provisions for physicians to move as they work is “a staggering waste of effort and resources.</p>
    
    <p>” Such attitudes are widely reflected in the way students and workers use their time. Children spend an average of 50 percent of the school day sitting, a proportion that increases as they enter adolescence. Adults in the workplace move even less, remaining seated for more than two-thirds of the average workday. We inherited a “mind on the hoof,” in the phrase of philosopher Andy Clark—but in today’s classrooms and offices, the vigorous clatter of hoofs has come to an eerie halt.</p>
    
    <p>
 THAT’S EMPHATICALLY not the case in the classroom helmed by Maureen Zink, a fourth-grade teacher at Vallecito Elementary School in San Rafael, California.
Her students don’t sit still at their desks; in fact, most of them are not sitting at all. In 2013, the entire school replaced traditional desks and chairs with standing desks, and the school’s “activity-permissive” ethos allows pupils to stand upright, perch on stools, sit on the floor, and otherwise move around as they wish. Though some were hesitant about the change, Zink and the other teachers at Vallecito now say it’s been a resounding success; students are more alert,
more attentive, and more engaged.</p>
