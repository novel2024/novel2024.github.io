What about Hypnotherapy?
Sometimes, hypnosis is used as a form of treatment for various conditions.
When hypnosis is used this way, it is referred to as hypnotherapy.
Hypnotherapy is essentially mind control where the person being controlled has given their consent for the same to a clinical psychologist.</p>
    
    <p> As with most alternative forms of treatment, there are divergent views on the efficacy of hypnotherapy. The fact that there is very limited research on the same does not do the case for hypnotherapy any good.
Hypnosis as a form of treatment is used to help patients break bad habits such as bad eating habits, and also in the treatment of addiction, eating disorders, and even insomnia. Hypnosis is also used in childbirth where pregnant women are advised to self-hypnotize so that they can prepare themselves mentally for almost painless childbirth.</p>

 Chapter 5: The Art of Persuasion and Deception Merriam-Webster defines persuasion as the ability to persuade while persuade is further defined as to move by argument, entreaty, or expostulation to a belief, position, or course of action. In fewer words, to persuade someone is to convince someone to do something. Persuasion is an art form that must be mastered by anyone who wants to get people to do something.</p>
    
    <p> It is an incredible tool to have, especially if you are constantly surrounded by people who need a little prodding every now and then.
  Deception, on the other hand, is defined as the act of causing someone to believe that something that is false or invalid is, in fact, true and valid.
Deception is a form of manipulation on its own and also a tool through which you can achieve your persuasion goals. This is probably where things get blurry as far as persuasion goes.</p>
    
    <p> For the longest time, there have been debates regarding the thin line between manipulation and persuasion. There are camps that are completely convinced of the malevolence of persuasion,
while others believe that persuasion is a totally harmless way of getting what you want from people. The topic of manipulation in itself is a grey area for a lot of people. Morality is subjective depending on the metrics put in place by different societies and cultures.</p>
