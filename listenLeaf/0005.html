    <p> We urge ourselves and others to grit it out, bear down, “just do it”—to think harder. But,
as we often find to our frustration, the brain is made of stubborn and unyielding stuff, its vaunted plasticity notwithstanding. Confronted by its limits, we may conclude that we ourselves (or our children or our students or our employees) are simply not smart enough, or not “gritty” enough. In fact, it’s the way we handle our mental shortcomings—which are, remember, endemic to our species —that is the problem.</p>
    
    <p> Our approach constitutes an instance of (as the poet William Butler Yeats put it in another context) “the will trying to do the work of the imagination.” The smart move is not to lean ever harder on the brain but to learn to reach beyond it.
In The Middle Class Gentleman, a comedy written by the seventeenth-century French playwright Molière, the would-be aristocrat Monsieur Jourdain is delighted by a realization that follows upon his learning the difference between prose and verse. “By my faith! For more than forty years I have been speaking prose without knowing anything about it!” he exclaims.</p>
    
    <p> Likewise, we may be impressed to learn that we have long been drawing extra-neural resources into our thinking processes—that we already think outside the brain.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that we often do it haphazardly,
without much intention or skill. It’s no wonder this is the case.</p>
    
    <p> Our efforts at education and training, as well as management and leadership, are aimed almost exclusively at promoting brainbound thinking. Beginning in elementary school,
we are taught to sit still, work quietly, think hard—a model for mental activity that will prevail during all the years that follow, through high school and college and into the workplace. The skills we develop and the techniques we are taught are those that involve using our heads: committing information to memory,
engaging in internal reasoning and deliberation, endeavoring to self-discipline and self-motivate.
Meanwhile, there is no corresponding cultivation of our ability to think outside the brain—no instruction, for instance, in how to tune in to the body’s internal signals, sensations that can profitably guide our choices and decisions.</p>
    
    <p>
We’re not trained to use bodily movements and gestures to understand highly conceptual subjects like science and mathematics, or to come up with novel and original ideas. Schools don’t teach students how to restore their depleted attention with exposure to nature and the outdoors, or how to arrange their study spaces so that they extend intelligent thought. Teachers and managers don’t demonstrate how abstract ideas can be turned into physical objects that can be manipulated and transformed in order to achieve insights and solve problems.
Employees aren’t shown how the social practices of imitation and vicarious learning can shortcut the process of acquiring expertise.</p>
    
    <p> Classroom groups and workplace teams aren’t coached in scientifically validated methods of increasing workplace teams aren’t coached in scientifically validated methods of increasing the collective intelligence of their members. Our ability to think outside the brain has been left almost entirely uneducated and undeveloped.
This oversight is the regrettable result of what has been called our “neurocentric bias”—that is, our idealization and even fetishization of the brain —and our corresponding blind spot for all the ways cognition extends beyond the skull. (As the comedian Emo Philips has remarked: “I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in my body.</p>
    
    <p> Then I realized who was telling me this.”) Seen from another perspective, however, this near-universal neglect represents an auspicious opportunity—a world of unrealized potential. Until recently, science shared the larger culture’s neglect of thinking outside the brain.
But this is no longer the case.</p>
    
    <p> Psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists are now able to provide a clear picture of how extra-neural inputs shape the way we think. Even more promising, they offer practical guidelines for enhancing our thinking through the use of these outside-the-brain resources.
Such developments are unfolding against the backdrop of a broader shift in how we view the mind—and, by extension, how we understand ourselves.
But first—to gain a sense of where we’ve been and where we’re headed, it’s worth taking several steps back in time, to the moment when our current ideas about the brain were born.</p>
