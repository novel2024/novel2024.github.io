    <p> If you ever find yourself engaged in an argument with a control freak do not expect to win. In any battle involving a control freak, they always win. If they do not win, the winner becomes the newest enemy that must be defeated come what may.
Control freaks also like to nitpick everybody and anybody, judging them according to the superior standards they have set for themselves.</p>
    
    <p> A control freak will have an opinion about anything under the sun, even when this opinion is uncalled for or even unsolicited. Their critique is harsh and often leaves others feeling worse. This is a way of gaining control for them; if you make someone feels inadequate and small, you have a better chance of getting them to comply with your demands, whatever these may be.
As you may have guessed, control freak is not the official psychological term for such individuals.</p>
    
    <p> Rather, this is a term that is used in informal circles to describe anyone who has an obsessive desire to get others to comply or to have control over others. While this unnatural need for control is motivated by the need for manipulative power over others, there are several root causes for this kind of behavior.
Control freaks often have personality disorders that cause them to behave as they do. A personality disorder is defined as a pattern of behavior that deviates from what is considered normal behavior.</p>
    
    <p> For this sort of behavior to be classified as a personality disorder (and not just a teenager having a bad day), it has to show up consistently, to the extent where it becomes deep-set in the individual’s life and daily choices. Everyone has their bad days from time to time when they make questionable decisions; an individual with a personality disorder has a bad day every day. Often,
personality disorders are diagnosed by adolescence. In some people, it might take longer for a diagnosis to be arrived at.</p>
    
    <p>
There are three personality disorders that are likely to result in a person becoming obsessed with having control over others. These include antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals with antisocial personality disorders often have an exaggerated sense of self-worth and very little empathy, if at all, for others. As such, they are often predisposed to controlling others without feeling any sort of mercy or sympathy.</p>
    
    <p> Sufferers of histrionic personality disorder, on the other hand, love attention. They will go to any lengths to gain attention from others. They must be in full control of the show even if it means lying about everything in their life to get this kind of attention. Getting attention is the means to and the outcome of the control they have over others.</p>
    
    <p> In short, attention is a song they can dance to forever.
Narcissists love control because they believe they are better than anyone else and that they are entitled to this control. There is simply no getting your way with a narcissist. If you are involved with a narcissist, be it at work or in a personal relationship, the only answer you will ever be allowed to utter is yes.</p>
    
    <p> Narcissists thrive on control because it feeds their unending desire to be the biggest deal in every room that they are in.
Their emotions are not authentic Have you ever come across someone who seemed very kind and generous,
but your instincts told you not to trust them? It’s probably because your sixth sense could detect that all that kindness and generosity was not authentic. While it is possible for the heart and mind to be fooled, the sixth sense is almost always able to pick out the lies from the truth.
Human predators know that there are certain emotions and behaviors that are beneficial in relationships.</p>
