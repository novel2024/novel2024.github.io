    <p> First he tries to explain the existence of the puppet-masters to the prisoners, but the masters are unlikely to corroborate his story since they derive much personal benefit from the current way of the world. Then he tries to explain how the system is arranged with the prisoners and the cave.
Tragically, he finds the prisoners more resistant than he expected. Most don't believe him--and why should they? Having adjusted to the light outside, he can't see the shadows as clearly as they can.</p>
    
    <p> "What a dimwit." Taking off the chains requires too much effort, so most of them remain seated. These are people who are very good and successful at identifying,
naming, and dealing with shadows, and so they may not want to leave.
There are also those who do feel the need to leave.</p>
    
    <p> Leaving is not easy;
it requires much learning and a reorientation of one's values from equating success with identifying shadows to equating success with moving around in the real world.
In real life, the prisoners of Plato's Cave are those who are prisoners or slaves to their wages and their culture. A wage slave is a wage earner who is entirely dependent on their wages. While the wage slave is free to leave the current job, he isn't free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not imagine the possibility of doing so.</p>
    
    <p> He is still entirely focused on the wall.
The wall shows other people not as who they are, but as what they own.
There goes a man in his new sports car--what is not seen is that the car is bought on credit and that the man is stressed because he is having trouble making the payments.
Wage slaves have jobs where they can go and spend their most productive hours writing high-powered memos so they can be more productive, while other people spend their time ignoring memos so they can be more productive too.</p>
    
    <p> This is how it goes. In fact, one of the great inventions of the 20th century, the personal computer, has made it possible to write even more memos and notices. This is great because it allows people to do their job while looking busier than ever. Looking busy is important because in this culture business is a virtue, just as being in debt is a virtue, and the most virtuous are those with the highest credit scores.</p>
    
    <p>
They're better at being in debt compared to other people. This endless working and paying is called "making a living," yet people are so busy "making a living" that they have no time for living. A wage slave is a person who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations, but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options available, like the prisoners in Plato's Cave. Their chains are not physical like those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the prisoners into their own prison wardens.</p>
    
    <p> Like the slaves in Plato's Cave, the only commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the "prison game," which means accumulating at least a million to retire.5 The disenchanted grumble about "the system" or "the man." The analogy of "the system" is the people walking around behind the chained slaves, keeping them going. However, it's mainly the slaves themselves who keep themselves going.</p>
    
    <p> We don't realize that we maintain this system by lack of imagination and questioning. Like birds, which never seem to have a flight plan, yet always seem to fly together in a swarming flock, we don't question. We obediently pick whatever options are handed to us, often choosing based on what our neighbors have chosen. We make the best of the shadows on the wall, but we do not question the wall.</p>
