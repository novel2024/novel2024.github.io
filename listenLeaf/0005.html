    <p>ON FEBRUARY 14, 1946, a breathless bustle filled the halls of the Moore Schoolof Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. On this day, the school’s secret jewelwas going to be revealed to the world: the ENIAC. Inside a locked room atMoore hummed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the firstmachine of its kind capable of performing calculations at lightning speed.Weighing thirty tons, the massive ENIAC used around eighteen thousandvacuum tubes, employed about six thousand switches, and encompassedupwards of half a million soldered joints; it had taken more than 200,000 man-hours to build.</p>
    
    <p>The bus-sized contraption was the brainchild of John Mauchly and J. PresperEckert Jr., two young scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, Moore’sparent institution. With funding from the US Army, the ENIAC had beendeveloped for the purpose of computing artillery trajectories for Americangunners fighting the war in Europe.</p>
    
    <p> Compiling trajectory tables—necessary forthe effective use of new weapons being introduced by the military—was alaborious process, requiring the service of teams of human “computers” workingin shifts around the clock. A machine that could do their job with speed andaccuracy would give the army an invaluable edge.Now, six months after V-Day, the demands of wartime were giving way to theNow, six months after V-Day, the demands of wartime were giving way to theneeds of an expanding economy, and Mauchly and Eckert had called a pressconference to introduce their invention to the world. The two men had preparedfor the event with deliberate care, and no small amount of stagecraft.</p>
    
    <p> As theENIAC chugged away at a given task, some three hundred neon lights built intothe machine’s accumulators flickered and flashed. Presper Eckert, known to allas “Pres,” judged the effect of these small bulbs insufficiently impressive. On themorning of the press conference, he ran out and purchased an armful of Ping-Pong balls, each of which he cut in half and marked with a number. The plasticdomes, glued over the neon bulbs, now cast a dramatic glow—especially oncethe room’s overhead lights were dimmed.</p>
    
    <p>At the appointed hour, the door to the room that held the ENIAC was opened,and a gaggle of officials, academics, and journalists filed in. Standing in front ofthe hulking machine, lab member Arthur Burks welcomed the group and soughtto impart to them a sense of the moment’s magnitude. The ENIAC wasengineered to carry out mathematical operations, he explained, and theseoperations, “if made to take place rapidly enough, might in time solve almostany problem.” Burks announced that he would begin the day’s demonstration byasking the ENIAC to multiply 97,367 by itself five thousand times.</p>
    
    <p> The reportersin the room bent over their notepads. “Watch closely, you may miss it,” hewarned, and pushed a button; before the newsmen had time to look up, the taskwas complete, executed on a punch card delivered to Burks’s hand.Next Burks fed the machine a problem like those for which it had beendesigned: the ENIAC would now calculate the trajectory of a shell taking thirtyseconds to travel from the gun to its target. Such a task would take a team ofhuman experts three days to compute; the ENIAC completed the job in twentyseconds, faster than the shell itself could fly.</p>
    
    <p> Jean Bartik, one of a group ofpioneering female engineers who helped program the ENIAC, was on hand forthe demonstration. She recalled, “It was unheard of that a machine could reachsuch speeds of calculation, and everyone in the room, even the greatmathematicians, were in complete wonder and awe at what they had just seen.”The next day, admiring accounts of the ENIAC appeared in newspapers allover the world. “PHILADELPHIA—One of the war’s top secrets, an amazingmachine which applies electronic speeds for the first time to mathematical taskshitherto too difficult and cumbersome for solution, was announced here tonightby the War Department,” the New York Times reported on its front page.</p>
    
    <p> TheTimes reporter, T. R. Kennedy Jr., sounded dazzled by what he’d seen.</p>
    
    <p> “Soclever is the device,” he wrote, “that its creators have given up trying to findproblems so long that they cannot be solved.”The introduction of the ENIAC was not just a milestone in the history oftechnology. It was a turning point in the story of how we understand ourselves.In its early days, Mauchly and Eckert’s invention was frequently compared to ahuman brain.</p>
    
    <p> Newspaper and magazine articles described the ENIAC as a “giantelectronic brain,” a “robot brain,” an “automatic brain,” and a “brain machine.”But before long, the analogy got turned around. It became a commonplace thatthe brain is like a computer. Indeed, the “cognitive revolution” that would sweepthrough American universities in the 1950s and 1960s was premised on thebelief that the brain could be understood as a flesh-and-blood computingmachine.</p>
