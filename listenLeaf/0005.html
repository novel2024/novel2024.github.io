    <p> The one thing we are not, in such moments, is cool or calm—and yet most of us are convinced that when we are in anxiety’s grip, what we ought to do is try to calm down.
Alison Wood Brooks, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, had a different notion of how to handle nervousness. In a series of three studies, she subjected groups of people to experiences that most everyone would find nerve- racking: completing “a very difficult IQ test” administered “under time pressure”; delivering, on the spot, “a persuasive public speech about ‘why you are a good work partner’ ”; and most excruciating of all, belting out an 80s pop song (“Don’t Stop Believin’,” by Journey). Before beginning the activity,
participants were to direct themselves to stay calm, or to tell themselves that they were excited.</p>
    
    <p>
Reappraising nervousness as excitement yielded a noticeable difference in performance. The IQ test takers scored significantly higher. The speech givers came across as more persuasive, competent, and confident. Even the singers performed more passably (as judged by the Nintendo Wii Karaoke Revolution program they used).</p>
    
    <p> All reported genuinely feeling the pleasurable emotion of excitement—a remarkable shift away from the unpleasant discomfort such activities might be expected to engender.
In a similar fashion, we can choose to reappraise debilitating “stress” as productive “coping.” A 2010 study carried out with Boston-area undergraduates looked at what happens when people facing a stressful experience are informed about the positive effects of stress on our thinking—that is, the way it can make us more alert and more motivated. Before taking the GRE, the admissions exam for graduate school, one group of students was given the following message to read: “People think that feeling anxious while taking a standardized test will make them do poorly on the test.</p>
    
    <p> However, recent research suggests that arousal doesn’t hurt performance on these tests and can even help performance. People who feel anxious during a test might actually do better. This means that you shouldn’t feel concerned if you do feel anxious while taking today’s GRE test. If you find yourself feeling anxious, simply remind yourself that your arousal could be helping you do well.</p>
    
    <p>” A second group received no such message before taking the exam. Three months later, when the students’ GRE scores were released, the students who had been encouraged to reappraise their feelings of stress scored an average of 65 points higher.
Reappraisal research has begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which this technique exerts its effects. In the GRE study, saliva samples were collected from all the participants and analyzed for the presence of a hormone associated with nervous system arousal.</p>
    
    <p> Among the students who engaged in reappraisal,
the level of this hormone was elevated—suggesting that their bodies had identified the presence of a challenge and were mounting an effective response,
enhancing their alertness and sharpening their attention. Another study explored the neural effects of the reappraisal technique on students who struggle with math anxiety. Their brains were scanned twice as they completed a set of math problems inside an fMRI machine. Before the first round, participants were told to use whatever strategies they usually employed.</p>
    
    <p> Before the second round,
participants were given instructions on how to engage in reappraisal. When employing the reappraisal approach, the students answered more of the math questions correctly, and the scans showed why: brain areas involved in executing arithmetic were more active under the reappraisal condition. The increased activity in these areas suggests that the act of reappraisal allowed students to redirect the mental resources that previously were consumed by anxiety,
applying them to the math problems instead.
Psychologists offer two additional points of interest for those adopting the strategy of reappraisal.</p>
    
    <p> The first is that reappraisal works best for those who are interoceptively aware: we have to be able to identify our internal sensations,
after all, before we can begin to modify the way we think about them. Second,
the sensations we’re actually feeling have to be congruent with the emotion we’re aiming to construct. We’re able to reappraise nervousness as excitement because the physiological cues associated with the two emotions are so similar;
if what we’re feeling is a heavy sense of apathy or lassitude, exclaiming “I’m so excited!” isn’t going to work.
Becoming aware of our internal sensations can help us handle our own emotions.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps more surprisingly, the body’s interoceptive faculty can also bring us into closer contact with other people’s emotions. That’s because the brain, on its own, has no direct access to the contents of other people’s minds, no way to feel what others are feeling. Interpreting others’ spoken words and facial expressions may yield only a coolly abstract sense of the emotions that churn within. The body acts as a critical conduit, supplying the brain with the visceral information it lacks.</p>
    
    <p> It does so in this way: When interacting with other people,
we subtly and unconsciously mimic their facial expressions, gestures, posture,
and vocal pitch. Then, via the interoception of our own bodies’ signals, we perceive what the other person is feeling because we feel it in ourselves. We bring other people’s feelings onboard, and the body is the bridge. In an act akin to taking a bite off our partner’s plate, or borrowing an earbud to hear the song our friend is listening to, we are sampling their emotions.</p>
