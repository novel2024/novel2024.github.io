    <p> When dressed down in boring clothes, these subjects did not appear as attractive as before. As such, it is almost safe to assume that the attention and effort that goes into getting ready and the confidence thereafter are what makes a narcissist or psychopath seem more attractive than they really are.
Myth #9: Psychopaths change when they have children.
Truth: Psychopath are unable to have emotions of empathy or caring even towards their own children.</p>
    
    <p>
Psychopaths start their own families, and when this happens, they usually have a very hard time nurturing their offspring. Unlike normal parents who are not on the dark triad scale, psychopaths have a hard time distinguishing their children as separate entities. Rather, they consider them to be tools or extension of themselves which are available for their use as they please.
Psychopaths are more likely to view their children as trophies that make them look good than as young, impressionable individuals who are looking for someone to guide them through life.</p>
    
    <p> As such, a typical psychopath will push their kids to excel in something they have no interest in even though this is at the expense of the kidsâ€™ mental health and well-being. They might forcefully enroll the kids in swimming classes, for instance because they believe their kid becoming an expert swimmer and competitor will improve their social standing in the community. Needless to say, psychopath parents are very hard to please seeing that they are used to excelling themselves and will not understand why their kids will not do whatever it takes to get to the top.
Myth #10: You are either on the dark triad or not Truth: The dark triad is a continuum on which some score highly while others score lowly The traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism are inherent in all of us.</p>
    
    <p> The only difference is that in some people, these traits are magnified to the point where they often become destructive to the people around them. Take narcissism, for instance. Everybody has a way that they think about themselves. More likely than not, you like to think good things about yourself.</p>
    
    <p> You like to believe that you are good-looking and talented and easy to love. For a narcissist, this self-image is blown out of proportion to the extent where their entire life revolves around. It is not enough for them to believe these things about themselves--they also want everyone else to believe they are perfect and saintly and all things good.
Psychopathy, on the other hand, is also a spectrum.</p>
    
    <p> Everybody has their place on this spectrum. Think of it this way: have you ever done something that was not so nice and yet did not feel guilty about it? Have you ever acted in a manner to suggest that you are not exactly empathetic towards someone?
If you have answered yes to any of these questions, then you exhibited psychopathic traits at least once in your life. This does not mean that you will go on to murder someone later in your life. It only means that there are instances when the psychopath in you comes out, and other instances when you might be able to catch yourself just in time.</p>
    
    <p> The way you were raised has an effect on whether you are able to stop yourself from unleashing your full psychopath.
Myth #11: Your boss is a psychopath Truth: Your boss may or may not be a psychopath It is true that many psychopaths who do not become career criminals go on to become highly successful in business, politics, and other fields. However,
this is not reason enough to accuse your boss of being a psychopath. Some people are simply driven and demanding because it is what they know and understand to be the requirement for success.</p>
    
    <p> In any case, not a whole lot of people have sleepovers and brunches with their bosses. There is a certain dynamic expected from a boss-employee relationship. Your tough-talking,
merciless boss may be a completely different person when they are not wearing their boss hat. Do not go thinking that everyone in authority positions is a sociopath or psychopath.</p>
