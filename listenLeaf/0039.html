    <p> Four years later, when it was time to start school, children from the richer families scored an average of 117 on a measure of vocabulary comprehension, compared to 93 for children from the poorer families.
Differences in the way parents gesture may thus be a little-recognized driver of unequal educational outcomes. Less exposure to gesture leads to smaller vocabularies; small differences in vocabulary size can then grow into large ones over time, with some pupils arriving at kindergarten with a mental word bank that is several times as large as that possessed by their less fortunate peers. And vocabulary size at the start of schooling is, in turn, a strong predictor of how well children perform academically in kindergarten and throughout the rest of their school years.</p>
    
    <p>
The good news: research shows that offering simple instructions to parents leads them to gesture more often; in turn, their children also gesture more. Any parent can adopt the strategies suggested by these intervention programs: Engage in frequent pointing with young children, and encourage the kids themselves to point. Incorporate this same gesture into the reading of picture books; point to particular words or illustrations, and ask children to point to what they see.
Come up with simple gestures to pair with real-life referents—a clawing motion for cat, a wiggling index finger for a caterpillar—and be sure to say the word aloud as the gesture is demonstrated.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps the most important fact to keep in mind, says Harvard education professor Meredith Rowe, is that a child’s language development is malleable, and that parents play an important role in shaping that development. In a 2019 study, Rowe delivered this message to a group of socioeconomically diverse parents and caregivers, along with reminders to gesture more. At the conclusion of the intervention, she found that adults who’d received the programming were engaging in pointing thirteen times more often, on average, than those who had not undergone the gesture training; the children in their lives were pointing significantly more too.
As children grow older, gesture continues to act as an advance party, scouting out mental territory well ahead of where their words are.</p>
    
    <p> Rather astonishingly,
researchers have found that children’s “newest and most advanced ideas” about how to understand a concept or solve a problem often show up first in their gestures. Take, for example, a six-year-old girl faced with a classic “conservation” task. (Such tasks were first employed by the pioneering psychologist Jean Piaget to investigate the course of childhood cognitive development.) The girl is shown a tall, skinny glass full of water, the contents of which are then poured into a short, wide glass.</p>
    
    <p> Asked whether the amount of water remains the same, the girl answers no—but at the same time, her hands are making a cupping motion, indicating that she’s beginning to understand that the wider shape of the second glass accounts for the way the same amount of water fills it at a lower level than the first glass.
This episode is drawn from a voluminous video archive compiled by Susan Goldin-Meadow, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago.
Goldin-Meadow has collected thousands of such video vignettes, recordings of individuals as they use words and gestures to explain how they solve problems.
Across these many scenes, she has identified an intriguing pattern: When speech and gesture are both correct and congruent, it’s a given that the speaker has mastered the material.</p>
    
    <p> When speech and gestures match but both are wrong, we can assume that the speaker is still far from “getting it.” But when there’s a mismatch between speech and gesture—when a person says one thing but does something else with her hands—then that individual can be said to be in a “transitional state,” moving from the incorrect notion she’s expressing in words to the correct one she is expressing in gesture.
In videos recorded by Goldin-Meadow of children carrying out conservation tasks, new understandings emerged first in gesture some 40 percent of the time.
Such mismatches appear to be a common occurrence across development: when ten-year-olds solve math problems, one study reported, their gestures represent strategies different from those found in their speech about 30 percent of the time.</p>
    
    <p>
Another study found that for fifteen-year-olds working on a problem-solving task, the rate of speech-gesture mismatch was 32 percent.
Furthermore, Goldin-Meadow has found, learners who produce such speech- gesture mismatches are especially receptive to instruction—ready to absorb and apply the correct knowledge, should a parent or teacher supply it. Even adults signal their readiness to learn through mismatches between what they’re saying and how their hands are moving. In one experiment, for example, a group of college students was asked to learn about a set of “stereoisomers”—chemical compounds that feature the same number of atoms but that differ from one another in the way the atoms are spatially arranged.</p>
    
    <p> The extent to which the undergraduates made gesture-speech mismatches while learning “predicted their ability to profit from instruction,” writes Goldin-Meadow, who was lead author of the study. “Namely, the more they expressed correct conceptual information in gesture that they did not verbalize in speech, the more they were subsequently able to learn.” When our words and our movements diverge, it’s our gestures that signal what happens next.
 WHY WOULD OUR “most advanced ideas” appear in our gestures before surfacing in our speech? Researchers speculate that gesture helps give shape to an incipient notion still forming in our minds.</p>
