    <p> Unlike for the specialist, shifting the generalist's curve still leaves substantial overlap with the market. The risk of the complex-coupled businessman is thus not of losing his job, as it is for the specialist, because in principle the businessman doesn't have a job, and he'll always be able to work. His risk is in the loss of profit, as profit depends on customers buying his products. In that sense, companies owe their existence to consumers (see Foundations of economics and finance).</p>
    
    <p>
Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn't risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business. Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working--the businessman is an entrepreneur. The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between shareholders and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom must be satisfied with the businessman in the middle, lest capital and profits vanish. Some companies reduce this risk by having no long-term debt or by having special classes of shares.</p>
    
    <p> Others reduce it by having many customers or clients or easy access to labor, either by outsourcing, offering attractive benefits or simply due to an abundance of workers in a given field.
However, as long as there is a drive for profit, there will be competition and innovation, and those risks are hard to eliminate without monopoly pricing power, political favors, and other barriers to entry. Since profit is the income of the businessman, and since the businessman needs income to buy stuff for himself, he too is at risk. Many businessmen and entrepreneurs take steps similar to employees and establish emergency funds (see The working man).</p>
    
    <p> However, those that desire to retire early either need to earn a lot of money fast or find an alternative solution.
The Renaissance man A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering intellectual areas as well as the arts, physical fitness, and social accomplishments. This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else. However, I think it can be argued that a specialist is not a well-balanced human.</p>
    
    <p> Many people strive for a sense a balance between work and life without ever achieving it,
leaving some areas underdeveloped and others overly so. This isn't the case for the Renaissance man, who develops all sides of himself to their full potential. Furthermore, generalized skills allow a Renaissance man to reach creative solutions for most of his needs. Because of his ability to solve problems, the Renaissance man is fairly independent of the marketplace since he no longer has to buy nearly as much to satisfy his needs.</p>
    
    <p> Rather than buying a product, he puts solutions together using social skills (borrowing, bartering), technical skills (building, reengineering), artistic skills (designing, creating), and physical fitness (humanpowered tools).
Buying less means that he doesn't require millions to reach financial independence. For the money he needs, jobs are much easier to find. The Renaissance man can apply for different jobs in different fields rather than just a single one.</p>
    
    <p> Although they don't pay as well as a highly specialized career job, less money is needed. Complex solutions based on multiple different skills don't require leverage. They may result in profit, but profit is merely a side effect of the construction, and therefore the Renaissance man isn't subject to the same risk as the businessman. The main purpose of the Renaissance man is to solve a problem as a human rather than as a part of the "work-spend" system.</p>
    
    <p>
The Renaissance man is capable of many different things and doesn't restrict himself to vocational skills. He does his own taxes and researches his own investments. He can fix a computer or a broken appliance. He knows how to drive and fix a car, but he has enough time and athletic ability to ride his bicycle 20 miles instead, or run five miles to get groceries.</p>
