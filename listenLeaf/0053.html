    <p> B. Plant High School in Tampa, Florida, for example, the large windows that were closed off in the 1970s were recently restored, letting daylight shine in for the first time in some four decades. When new schools and office buildings are constructed, some architects are now thinking in terms of balancing occupants’ need for natural light with the obligation to reduce costs and conserve energy. At PS 62 in Staten Island, New York—also known as the Kathleen Grimm School of Leadership and Sustainability—the school building generates as much energy as it consumes, thanks to solar panels, a wind turbine, and heating and cooling systems powered by underground geothermal wells.</p>
    
    <p> Completed in 2015, the structure achieves “daylight autonomy” as much as 90 percent of the time: that is, its classrooms and hallways are illuminated almost entirely by the sun. In addition to saving funds and protecting the environment, says principal Lisa Sarnicola, the thoughtful design of the school building enlivens the students’ education. “It changes the whole mood of the building,” she says. “It makes the children happy.</p>
    
    <p>” There is even evidence that views of nature are associated with improved academic performance. John Spengler, a professor at the Chan School of Public Health at Harvard, employed an ingenious method of gauging the “greenness” of school grounds: with satellite images, taken by a NASA spacecraft from four hundred miles above the earth. Spengler and his colleagues analyzed aerial photographs of public schools in Massachusetts, determining the amount of vegetation present on their grounds, and compared these measurements with scores on the MCAS, the statewide assessment of academic skill, earned by students in grades three through ten. Controlling for race, gender, family income,
and English as a second language, among other factors, the results “showed that a higher surrounding greenness contributes to a better English and mathematics academic performance in students of all grades,” the researchers reported.</p>
    
    <p>
Another, more direct test of the effect of natural surroundings was carried out by William Sullivan, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Illinois, and his colleague Dongying Li. High school students were randomly assigned to a room with a view of greenery, a room with a view of a building or parking lot, or a windowless room. The researchers taxed the mental resources of the participants with a series of challenging activities, including completing a proofreading exercise, giving a speech, and solving a set of mental math problems. Then Sullivan and Li administered a test of attention to each participant, gave them a ten-minute break, and administered the attention test a second time—all within each participant’s assigned room.</p>
    
    <p> The high school students who were able to gaze out the window at greenery during their break scored 13 percent higher on the second administration of the attention test; the students who looked out on built surroundings, or at windowless walls, did not improve at all.
The benefits of a room with a natural view hold for office workers as well as students. A study carried out for the California Energy Commission examined the effects of window access on the performance of two groups of people employed by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Workers in the district’s call center were found to process calls 6 to 12 percent faster when they had the best possible view (a nearby window looking onto a green vista) versus having no view.</p>
    
    <p> And workers in the district’s main office were found to score 10 to 25 percent higher on tests of mental function and memory recall when they had the best possible view versus having no view.
Even a brief glance out the window can make a difference in our mental capacity. Researchers from the University of Melbourne in Australia found that a forty-second “micro-break” spent looking out at a roof covered with flowering meadow plants led study participants to perform better on a cognitive test than did an equally short break spent looking at a bare concrete expanse. Participants who gazed at the green roof were more alert, made fewer errors, and were more in control of their attention.</p>
    
    <p> We can seek out such “microrestorative opportunities” throughout the day, replenishing our mental resources with each glance out the window.
 MICRORESTORATIVE EXPERIENCES have their place in busy workdays and school schedules. But longer stretches spent in nature, when we can arrange them, may change how we think in deeper and more subtle ways, altering how we experience time and how we think about the future. “Oh, these vast calm measureless mountain days,” exclaimed naturalist and author John Muir about the time he spent hiking the Sierras in the American West.</p>
    
    <p> In May 1903 Muir guided Theodore Roosevelt, then president of the United States, on a three-day camping trip through California’s Yosemite Valley. “The first night we camped in a grove of giant sequoias,” Roosevelt later recalled. “It was clear weather, and we lay in the open, the enormous cinnamon-colored trunks rising about us like the columns of a vaster and more beautiful cathedral than was ever conceived by any human architect.” As the two men toured the glories of Yosemite, Muir warned the president that the country’s bountiful natural beauty was in danger of being despoiled if it was not preserved by official decree.</p>
