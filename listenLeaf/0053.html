    <p> [0 hours] Novice--knowledge or skills that any reasonably intelligent layman possess.
2. [300 hours] Apprentice--some skills, but can't be trusted to do independent work.
3.</p>
    
    <p> [1,000 hours] Journeyman--competent technician,
capable of independent routine tasks.
4. [3,000 hours] Master--proficient mechanic, capable of almost any task.
5.</p>
    
    <p> [10,000 hours] Expert--superior proficiency, capable of original work.
6. [30,000 hours] Genius--legendary proficiency,
capable of extraordinarily original work.
These terms which, except for the top level, have been borrowed from the professional trades, are known in the educational system as high school,
Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees; genius is beyond what can be obtained educationally.</p>
    
    <p> Note that the levels are close to being logarithmically spaced, suggesting that they are governed by a scaling power law. In other words, competence is judged by the rarity of the willingness and ability to put in the effort. The level at 30,000 hours is reserved for the Mozarts and da Vincis of the world, who spend every waking hour on their field of expertise. The hours are active learning hours.</p>
    
    <p>
Mindless repetition doesn't count towards the total. Five years of experience isn't the same as one year of experience repeated five times. The nominal rank isn't important either--we all know people whose work is better than their title suggests, and vice versa--rather, it is the degree of accumulated effort that distinguishes one level from the next.
Since not all effort is the same and not everybody learns and develops at the same pace, it's more useful to look at expertise by considering the following list, which parallels the development mentioned above.</p>
    
    <p>
1. Copying 2. Comparing 3. Compiling 4.</p>
    
    <p> Computing 5. Coordinating 6. Creating In the first stage, a person is unthinkingly copying what he sees in his surroundings. A person at this stage is entirely at the mercy of his surroundings.</p>
    
    <p> For those learning the skills of personal finance, good role models instill good financial behavior, whereas bad role models instill bad financial behavior. Many people live all their lives at this stage (see this figure). This is the novice level.
In the second stage, the person becomes aware that there's more than one way of behaving, possibly by copying other people who behave differently.</p>
