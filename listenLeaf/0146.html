    <p> It's equally valid to work 3 years and take the next 3 years off. A flexible work schedule would mean that instead of counting in years, you could be counting in months or even days or hours (a one hour work day, anyone?).
In other words, with a 20% savings rate, you could take 1 month off each time you work 4 months, or 1 day off each time you work 4 days.
Alternatively, with a 75% savings rate, you could work 3 months and take the rest of the year off.</p>
    
    <p> This works for anyone with a great deal of control over the timing of his income--for example, entrepreneurs, seasonal workers (farmers, tax accountants), freelancers, skilled travelers and contractors, handymen; in general, anyone who can easily find work without committing to an extended employment. Conversely, it doesn't work well for salaried career professionals.
Financial independence and investing The above calculations don't take investment returns on the fund into account. It stands to reason that if someone accumulates a 9 year fund by saving 75% while working for 3 years and invests it with a 5% return, it'll last longer than 9 years before it runs out, because of the investment returns on the money that hasn't been spent yet.</p>
    
    <p>
Presuming the returns can be guaranteed--more about that later--it's possible to calculate exactly how long such a fund will last if it compounds interest at a rate i. Suppose the fund has a size P0 and each year p is withdrawn on the first day of the year, while the rest of the money is invested for a year at a rate i. Then the amount of money after one year will be P1=(P0-p)+i(P0-p)=(P0-p)(1+i)=P0(1+i)-p(1+i).
Another p is withdrawn (we have now withdrawn a total of 2p) and the remaining amount P1-c is invested again at the rate i.</p>
    
    <p> The amount available at the end of the second year is then P2=(P1-p)(1+i) = P1(1+i)-p(1+i) = (P0(1+i)-p(1+i))(1+i)-p(1+i) = P0(1+i)2-p(1+i)2-p(1+i),
where we substituted in P1 from the first equation. Repeating this, we find the remaining amount after the third year to be P3=(P2-p)(1+i)=P0(1+i)3-p(1+i)3-p(1+i)2-p(1+i) and so on up to PN=P0(1+i)N-p(1+i)N-p(1+i)N-1-...</p>
    
    <p>-p(1+i)2-p(1+i) =P0(1+i)N-p[(1+i)N+(1+i)N-1+...+(1+i)2+(1+i)].</p>
    
    <p>
Write the term in the square bracket as (S for sum) S = (1+i)N+(1+i)N-1+...+(1+i)2+(1+i),
then (S+1)(1+i) = (1+i)N+1+(1+i)N+.</p>
    
    <p>..+(1+i)2+(1+i),
and so (S+1)(1+i)-S = S+Si+(1+i)-S = Si+(1+i) = (1+i)N+1 because all the individual terms in the sum cancel out (set N to any random number and write the sum out to verify if in doubt) leading to S = ((1+i)N+1-(1+i))/(i) = ((1+i)((1+i)N-1))/(i).
Substitute this equation and this equation back into this equation to get PN = P0(1+i)N-pS = P0(1+i)N-pS = P0(1+i)N-p((1+i)((1+i)N-1))/(i).</p>
    
    <p>
We are interested in using this formula to determine how long the portfolio will last, namely, how large is N?107 When money runs out, PN == 0,
therefore we rewrite this equation as 0 = (P0)/(p)i-(1+i)(1-1(1+i)N),
and so N=log[(1)/(1- (P0)/(p)(i)/(1+i))]/log(1+i).
From this formula--which incidentally is the point where you can wake up again if you fell asleep during the derivation--we see that if we have a P0=10 year fund which pays out p=1 annually at a 4% (i=0.04) interest, it lasts N=12.38 years rather than 10 years.</p>
