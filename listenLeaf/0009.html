    <p> What's more, they will have experienced much mental anguish before finally capitulating and declaring, "Enough of this frugality," or, "I want to splurge; I deserve it," or,
"I give up; I'll just hire a professional." No, one's entire philosophy must change. Later on I offer a philosophy modeled on the Renaissance ideal of the 17th century and the craftsmen of the 18th century who wrote the Constitution of the United States at the peak of the Age of Enlightenment.
This is a framework of complexity where a person is skilled in more than just one area.</p>
    
    <p> It is, in a way, a contrarian approach to the contemporary idea of "one man-one specialization." It's an interlocking way of arranging one's life. In risk management parlance, one wants to transfer from a tightly coupled linear system of financed consumerism to a loosely coupled,
complex system of the financially independent Renaissance man.
Naturally, I do not expect everybody to like this philosophy.</p>
    
    <p> We typically tend to like philosophies that are already somewhat aligned with our personal values and talents. For example, books like this one, which first tell you that everything about our current society is wrong, and then try to offer an alternative, are mostly a reflection of the author's values rather than an absolute view. We're all different and it's up to each of us to develop, grow, and walk our unique path. This is what it means to be human.</p>
    
    <p> One thing is certain, though: conspicuous consumption is not a natural state for all of us.
This change isn't easy. Not everybody can do it. In a sense, it's like running a marathon or getting into shape.</p>
    
    <p> Running a marathon is technically easy, but few have the persistence to actually go through with it, and even fewer are already in such a physical condition so as to do it without preparation. Mental blocks are similar. It's much easier to say that something can't work than it is to find a way to make it work. There are always excuses.</p>
    
    <p> "I don't want it enough;" "It'd be nice, but I can't do it," they say. Of course they can do it. There are no laws of physics that forbid it. There are, thankfully, no laws of society that forbid it, either.</p>
    
    <p> They just prefer their convenient, predictable, and comfortable misery. So don't expect people to immediately understand when you start casting your chains off. There will also be resistance from "well-adjusted" people who like to see everybody fit a particular mold and who don't tolerate anyone with different values. They'll tell you that you are unrealistic and irresponsible, and maybe speak of duty: "If you don't work, you're lazy.</p>
    
    <p> If you don't spend, you're unpatriotic." Yet these same people may feel stuck in a life of quiet desperation--stuck because they've convinced themselves that everything is good as long as others are living the same way. In the best case, people will be slightly amused at what a crackpot you are: "Yes, that is interesting and may be fine for you, but I could never..</p>
