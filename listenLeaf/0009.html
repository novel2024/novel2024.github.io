    <p> It will be an ever-ending conquest that you are most likely going to lose. Seeing that perfection is often so hard to come by in everyday life, narcissists often end up miserable and frustrated.
Narcissists have an unquenchable thirst for control It is important always to be ready to take charge when called upon. This is a mark of all great leaders.</p>
    
    <p> In your own life, it helps to have a healthy sense of control over various aspects. After all, you cannot go through life drifting here and there with no sense of purpose or direction. For narcissists,
however, the need for control is more visceral--they must be in control come what may. Remember their great need for perfection? Well, narcissists feel that they must be in control so that they can achieve this perfection.</p>
    
    <p>
They simply cannot trust other ‘lesser beings’ to be in control because then they will mess everything up. A narcissistic partner will want to dictate what friends you can have, whether you should have a job or not, whether your friends can come over to your house or not and just about every detail of your life.  At the beginning of a relationship with a narcissist, you might find you mistake this need for control for undying love and devotion. Later on, however, you will start to feel mistrusted and suffocated, and that will mark the beginning of the end.</p>
    
    <p> In the workplace, narcissists love to manage every aspect of their employees’ work. A narcissistic supervisor will not give his juniors any room to breathe and will do everything possible to ensure that he is the one calling all the shots.
Narcissists have no sense of boundaries Your boundaries are those guidelines that you have set to determine how your personal interactions will go about. Boundaries establish what is acceptable and not acceptable in your life.</p>
    
    <p> For many people, boundaries are second nature. For instance, most people will not take insults while lying down. It is simply not acceptable for them to be disrespected this way.
Normal people are able to acknowledge boundaries in their everyday life.</p>
    
    <p>
Narcissists, on the other hand, have no time for such frivolities. A narcissist will have no problem intruding in your personal space because they believe they have a right to be there. They get a high from flouting social norms and rules because they believe these rules do not apply to them, and nobody can do anything about it since they are superior to everyone else anyway.
How Do Narcissists Control Others?
Now that you know how a narcissist looks like, you are probably wondering what the narcissist in your life is doing to control you.</p>
    
    <p> The traits of a narcissist discussed in the previous section seem pretty easy to notice. After all, how hard can it be to notice when someone is trying to control you? The answer is that it can be very hard, especially when this person disguises their actions as simply looking out for you. Most narcissists are usually very smart and are able to blend in your everyday life without calling attention to themselves. They may also be very talented and creative, and this will usually be the charm that draws you to them.</p>
    
    <p> When you are out there looking for a monster in the form of a narcissist, you might not be looking for that talented and super creative friend who always has a solution for everything. And yet, she might be the one narcissist in your life who is only concerned about winning regardless of who gets hurt along the way.
Besides making use of their aforementioned traits to the best of their abilities, narcissists are also very keen liars. In a bid to be the star of every show, narcissists easily master the skill of deceit in its various forms.</p>
