    <p> The loss of his usually ever-present computer hithim, he later wrote, “like a sudden and somewhat vicious type of (hopefullytransient) brain damage.” He was left “dazed, confused, and visibly enfeebled—the victim of the cyborg equivalent of a mild stroke.” The experience, distressingas it was, provided fodder for a notion he had been pondering for some time. Hiscomputer, he realized, had in a sense become a part of his mind, an integralelement of his thinking processes.</p>
    
    <p> His mental capacities were effectivelyextended by the use of his laptop, allowing his brain to overachieve—to thinkmore efficiently and effectively, more intelligently, than it could without thedevice. His brain plus his computer equaled his mind, extended.Two years earlier, Clark and his colleague David Chalmers had coauthored anarticle that named and described just this phenomenon. Their paper, titled “TheExtended Mind,” began by posing a question that would seem to have anobvious answer.</p>
    
    <p> “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” itasked. Clark and Chalmers went on to offer an unconventional response. Themind does not stop at the standard “demarcations of skin and skull,” they argued.Rather, it is more accurately viewed as “an extended system, a coupling ofbiological organism and external resources.</p>
    
    <p>” A recognition of this reality, theyacknowledged, “will have significant consequences”—in terms of “philosophicalviews of the mind,” but also “in moral and social domains.” The authors wereaware that the vision they were setting out would require a thorough reimaginingof what people are like and how they function, a reimagining they saw asnecessary and right. Once “the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped,” theyconcluded, “we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of theworld.”The world, at first, was not so sure.</p>
    
    <p> Before being published in Analysis in1998, the paper received rejections from three other journals. Once in print, “TheExtended Mind” was greeted with perplexity—and no small amount of derision.But the idea it proposed turned out to have surprising power, within the academyand well beyond it. What at first appeared radical and out-there quickly came toseem less so, as daily life in the digital age provided a continuous proof-of-concept demonstration of people extending their minds with their devices.</p>
    
    <p>Initially derided as wacky, the notion of the extended mind came to seememinently plausible, even prescient.In the more than twenty years since the publication of “The Extended Mind,”the idea it introduced has become an essential umbrella concept under which avariety of scientific sub-fields have gathered. Embodied cognition, situatedcognition, distributed cognition: each of these takes up a particular aspect of theextended mind, investigating how our thinking is extended by our bodies, by thespaces in which we learn and work, and by our interactions with other people.Such research has not only produced new insights into the nature of humancognition; it has also generated a corpus of evidence-based methods forextending the mind.</p>
    
    <p>That’s where this book comes in: it aims to operationalize the extended mind,to turn this philosophical sally into something practically useful. In chapter 1,we’ll learn how to tune in to our interoception—the sensations that arise fromwithin the body—and how to use these signals to make sounder decisions. Inchapter 2, we’ll find out how moving our bodies can nudge our minds towarddeeper understanding. Chapter 3 looks at how the gestures we make with ourhands can bolster our memory.</p>
    
    <p> Chapter 4 examines how time spent in naturalspaces can restore our depleted attention. In chapter 5, we’ll see how built spaces—the interiors we inhabit at school and at work—can be designed to promotecreativity. In chapter 6, we will explore how moving our thoughts out of ourheads and into “the space of ideas” can lead us to new insights and discoveries.Chapter 7 probes how we can think with the minds of experts; chapter 8considers how we can think with classmates, colleagues, and other peers.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, in chapter 9, we’ll examine how groups thinking together can becomemore than the sum of their members.Across these varied instantiations of the extended mind, several commonthemes are apparent. The first of these concerns the source of Andy Clark’sinitial inspiration: the role of technology in extending our thinking. Our devicescan and do extend our minds, of course—but not always; sometimes they lead usto think less intelligently, as anyone who’s been distracted by clickbait or misledby a GPS system can tell you.</p>
    
    <p> The failure of our technology to consistentlyenhance our intelligence has to do with a metaphor we encountered earlier in thisintroduction: the computer as brain. Too often, those who design today’scomputers and smartphones have forgotten that users inhabit biological bodies,occupy physical spaces, and interact with other human beings. Technology itselfis brainbound—but by the same token, technology itself could be extended,broadened to include the extra-neural resources that do so much to enrich thethinking we do in the offline world. In each of the chapters that follow, we’llencounter examples of such “extended technology”—from an online foreign-language-learning platform that encourages its users to make gestures and notjust repeat words; to a Waze-like app that plots not the fastest route but the onemost filled with nature’s greenery; to a video game that induces players to looknot at the screen but at one another, synchronizing their movements in pursuit ofa shared experience.</p>
