    <p> Such assumptions have profoundly shaped the views we hold on the nature of mental activity, on the conduct of education and work, and on the value we place on ourselves and others. It’s therefore startling to contemplate that the whole lot of it could be misconceived. To grasp the nature of this error, we need to consider another metaphor.
 ON THE MORNING of April 18, 2019, computer screens went dark across a swath of Seoul, South Korea’s largest city.</p>
    
    <p> Lights flickered out in schools and offices across the 234-square-mile metropolis, home to some 10 million people.
Stoplights at street intersections blinked off, and electric-powered trains slowed to a halt. The cause of the blackout was as small in scale as its effects were widespread: a power outage caused by magpies, the black-and-white-feathered birds who build their nests on utility poles and transmission towers. Magpies— members of the corvid family, which also includes crows, jays, and ravens—are well known for making their nests out of whatever is available in the environment.</p>
    
    <p> The birds have been observed using an astonishing array of materials: not only twigs, string, and moss, but also dental floss, fishing line, and plastic Easter grass; chopsticks, spoons, and drinking straws; shoelaces, eyeglass frames, and croquet wickets. During the American Dust Bowl of the 1930s,
which eliminated vegetation from huge swaths of the West, magpies’ corvid cousins made nests out of barbed wire.
The densely packed urban neighborhoods of modern-day Seoul feature few trees or bushes, so magpies use what they can find: metal clothes hangers, TV antennas, and lengths of steel wire. These materials conduct electricity—and so,
when the birds build their nests on the city’s tall electrical transmission towers,
the flow of electricity is regularly disrupted.</p>
    
    <p> According to KEPCO, the Korea Electric Power Corporation, magpies are responsible for hundreds of power Electric Power Corporation, magpies are responsible for hundreds of power outages annually in areas all across the country. Each year, KEPCO employees work to remove upwards of ten thousand nests, but just as quickly the magpies build them up again.
Magpies may pose a headache for power companies, but their activity supplies a felicitous analogy for the way the mind works. Our brains, it might be said, are like magpies, fashioning their finished products from the materials around them,
weaving the bits and pieces they find into their trains of thought.</p>
    
    <p> Set beside the brain-as-computer and brain-as-muscle metaphors, it’s apparent that the brain as magpie is a very different kind of analogy, with very different implications for how mental processes operate. For one thing: thought happens not only inside the skull but out in the world, too; it’s an act of continuous assembly and reassembly that draws on resources external to the brain. For another: the kinds of materials available to “think with” affect the nature and quality of the thought that can be produced. And last: the capacity to think well—that is, to be intelligent—is not a fixed property of the individual but rather a shifting state that is dependent on access to extra-neural resources and the knowledge of how to use them.</p>
    
    <p>
This is, admittedly, a radically new way of thinking about thinking. It may not feel easy or natural to adopt. But a growing mass of evidence generated within several scientific disciplines suggests that it’s a much more accurate rendering of how human cognition actually works. Moreover, it’s a gratifyingly generative conceptualization, because it offers so many practical opportunities for improving how well we think.</p>
    
    <p> It has arrived just in time. Recasting our model of how the mind functions has lately become an urgent necessity, as we find ourselves increasingly squeezed by two opposing forces: we need ever more to think outside the brain, even as we have become ever more stubbornly committed to the brainbound approach.
First, as to that growing need to think outside the brain: as many of us can readily recognize—in the accelerated pace of our days and the escalating complexity of our duties at school and work—the demands on our thinking are ratcheting up. There’s more information we must deal with.</p>
    
    <p> The information we have to process is coming at us faster. And the kind of information we must deal with is increasingly specialized and abstract. This difference in kind is especially significant. The knowledge and skills that we are biologically prepared to learn have been outstripped by the need to acquire a set of competencies that come far less naturally and are acquired with far more difficulty.</p>
