    <p> Other rooms, like the dining room or sitting room, are practically never used. This leaves the bedroom.
When sharing, one has to avoid queuing problems. If you live in a place where everybody needs to leave at seven in the morning and wants to get up at the same time, you have a queuing problem.</p>
    
    <p> This is typically solved by having multiple bathrooms. This ridiculous waste can be solved by a slight change of habit (someone gets up half an hour earlier) or simply by living with people who have different habits.
When I was a grad student, I lived in a dorm. More accurately, as I spent most of my waking hours in my office, I realized that I effectively lived in my office.</p>
    
    <p> The dorm room I had was just a place where I slept. I'd sleep about 7-9 hours a day, which effectively meant my bed had a duty cycle of 33%, which is probably what most bedrooms see; except a berth on a small ship, which may see 66% or even 100% use as one person can sleep while the other is on watch. I cooked once every six days--I did all my own cooking--and ate in my room. Cooking took 30 minutes a week.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore,
if I had had my own kitchen, my duty cycle would have been 0.5 / (6Ã—24)=0.347%, which is a waste of resources. It therefore made sense to share the kitchen with others--18 others.</p>
    
    <p> I avoided the crowds due to my work schedule. I'm at my most creative during evenings and nights, when there are few distractions. Hence I would cook and do laundry at two in the morning. Showers and toilets were also shared (and professionally cleaned daily).</p>
    
    <p> This also makes sense. After all, how much time do you spend in the bathroom? For my schedule and priorities, my living arrangements, 10 minutes away from my office, were fully optimized, with very little waste.
Many consider living with other people a horrible idea. I suspect this is due to atrophied social skills from living apart in houses, and lately, in rooms.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps a criteria for moving in with anyone, for instance your spouse or a friend, should be sufficient social skills to be able to tolerate being together in small quarters. Learn to be easy to get along with. Be considerate. I'm sure this is a learned skill.</p>
    
    <p> Historically, extended families have lived together just fine, and perhaps living under the same roof as Uncle Bob or sharing a house with another family will become the norm once again.
Living together with others provides significant economies of scale,
with the largest effect realized by adding the first person (see this figure and Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle). The fewer people there are in a household and the more aligned their interests are, the fewer the compromises that have to be made. Therefore, depending on alignment, there's an optimal number of people in a household.</p>
