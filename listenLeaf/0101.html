    <p> One day, a fellow scientist named Henri Becquerel showed Marie and Pierre a special kind of rock called pitchblende.
When Henri took this pitchblende rock into a dark room, Marie could see that it gave off a light blue glow.” This second account continued: “Henri explained that the pitchblende had a lot of the element called uranium, and that he believed that the glow came from the uranium. Certainly, this was one of the strangest rocks that Marie and Pierre had ever seen, which is why they wanted to learn as much as possible about the mysterious blue glow and whether it came from the uranium.</p>
    
    <p>” The second group of students went on to hear about how Marie and Pierre crushed the rock into tiny pieces, how they burned it at different temperatures and added different kinds of acid to see what would happen. They read about how the two scientists discovered that the uranium in the rock was emitting energetic particles, a property they named “radioactivity.” And, the students were told, “while working with excitement and hope for developing a brand new element, Pierre and Marie noticed that they were beginning to feel tired and sick”—the effects of radiation poisoning.
Study author Diana Arya, an assistant professor of education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wanted to see whether the difference in presentation would produce a difference in learning.</p>
    
    <p> It did. Students understood the material more thoroughly, and remembered it more accurately, when it was given to them in the form of a story—in particular, a story that captured the human motives and choices that lay behind the creation of what is now well- established knowledge. Arya notes that it’s not the case that the second version was artificially imbued with narrative drama; rather, it’s the conventional text that has been stripped of “a sense of the feelings of importance and intrigue that originally inspired the discovery.” Alas, such conventional texts—devoid of human stories and human sentiment —make up the bulk of the information students encounter in school, and, for that matter, of the information employees encounter in the workplace.</p>
    
    <p> This “depersonalized” approach, as other educational psychologists have called it,
fails to take advantage of the distinctive power wielded by narrative. Cognitive scientists refer to stories as “psychologically privileged,” meaning they are granted special treatment by our brains. Compared to other informational formats, we attend to stories more closely. We understand them more readily.</p>
    
    <p>
And we remember them more accurately. Research has found that we recall as much as 50 percent more information from stories than from expository passages.
Why do stories exert these effects on us? One reason is that stories shape the way information is shared in cognitively congenial ways. The human brain has evolved to seek out evidence of causal relationships: this happened because of that.</p>
    
    <p> Stories are, by their nature, all about causal relationships; Event A leads to Event B, which in turn causes Event C, and so on. If a speaker were to relate a story in which the first part of the tale had no bearing on the second part,
listeners would justifiably protest that this so-called “story” made no sense. At the same time, stories don’t spell everything out for us either. If a storyteller were to laboriously connect every narrative dot, listeners would again rightly object: Okay, we get it! When stories are told well, only the highlights are included, leaving listeners to fill in the causal inferences that lend the story its full meaning.</p>
    
    <p> Such inferences require some mental effort, though not too much,
making stories enjoyable to listen to and think about. But precisely because we do have to think about stories in order to understand them—do have to maintain a mental chain of events that links beginning, middle, and end—we’re more likely to remember stories than to remember information that doesn’t require such cognitive processing.
There’s another reason why stories affect us more deeply than non-narrative forms of information: when we listen to a story, our brains experience the action as if it were happening to us. Brain-scanning studies show that when we hear about characters emoting, the emotional areas of our brains become active; when we hear about characters moving vigorously, the motor regions of our brains are roused.</p>
    
    <p> We even tend to remember what characters in a story are said to remember and forget what the characters forget. On the basis of such evidence,
researchers have concluded that we understand stories by running a simulation of them in our minds. Because stories by their nature feature human actors carrying out observable actions, our brains generate a mental movie of the events —an imaginary film strip that doesn’t unfurl when we’re reading a set of facts or instructions. Such simulations offer a kind of practice by proxy; the experiences we hear about in stories didn’t happen to us, but thanks to the mental dress rehearsal we conduct as we listen, we’ll be better prepared when they do.</p>
