    <p> Since few people have that kind of money, they're often advised to apply the minimum amount of effort when it comes to investing.
With asset management, skill and wisdom are rewarded directly proportionally to the asset base, but never proportionally to the time base.
This is probably the most important cultural barrier to overcome in a society that prides itself on being busy and productive. Frequently, asset managers get wealthy just by waiting and being wise.</p>
    
    <p> The real challenge,
especially faced by professional asset managers, but hopefully not by you,
is the tendency to ignore this fact. Many associate effort with taking action,
but not taking action is also a form of action. In fact, often not taking action is just what is required. The easiest way to get in the right frame of mind is to stop thinking like a farmer and start thinking like a hunter.</p>
    
    <p> A farmer (and a modern salary-, working-, and businessman) gets rewarded by activity.
The more he does, the greater his reward. Conversely, a hunter isn't going to catch anything if he thrashes around in the woods, frantically looking for prey. A strategy where he first identifies the best place to hunt (skill), and then waits patiently for the opportunity to present itself, will be more successful.</p>
    
    <p> In this sense, the farmer-turned-hunter is his own worst enemy.
Patience is a virtue that can take years or maybe even decades to develop.
An impatient investor is likely to fire off all his arrows before the situation is optimal and will never make as much money as someone who can wait.
Conversely, an impatient farmer will keep his beds free of weeds and therefore impatience and a strong inclination towards productivity works for him.</p>
    
    <p>
The goal of asset management or any management is to either create an environment or alternatively be in an environment that allows for optimal yield. Here optimal could mean the largest possible, the largest possible when adjusted for volatility, or the largest possible when adjusted for catastrophic loss. Like traditional management, micromanagement, which tries to increase yield by substituting time for assets, never provides the intended results.
Investment science Economics (and investing) is often said to suffer from "physics envy",
in that it would like to be an exact science.</p>
    
    <p> To do this, mathematics, which is precise though not necessarily accurate, is used to give the impression of accuracy. Using an equation is no substitute for understanding an equation.
In fact, an equation isn't a black box where one cranks the handle to obtain a result.113 Rather, it's an idea formulated in another language which just happens to be internally consistent, so that one idea may be transformed into another idea and remain consistent! In particular, the limitations of the equations should be understood--very often people make simplifying assumptions to make a problem mathematically tractable.</p>
    
    <p>114 This works well in physics because the universe seems to be inherently simple. It works poorly when it comes to predicting behavior because people, even when treated statistically, are complex.
Investing is a skill to be learned. Copying requires no skill (see Gauging mastery).</p>
    
    <p> The easiest thing to copy is the average, since there are few numbers simpler than the average to describe a set. The average is also known as the market index. Since copying requires no effort, the cost is zero and so the return on effort is undefined. In particular, "average" is psychologically attractive, because people like to compare themselves to others and a guaranteed average usually feels better than below average.</p>
