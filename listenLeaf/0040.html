Physically, he keeps up with people decades younger than himself. He can play an instrument, dance, paint, or write creatively. He can create interesting meals from scratch rather than recipe. Socially, he knows who to ask for help, who needs help, and how to put people together to efficiently solve problems.</p>
    
    <p> He is a leader or an inspiration to other people, whether it is personal, local, national, or global.
The Renaissance man has the best of all worlds. In this figure, we can draw a line of increasing job dependence from the highly independent Renaissance man to the highly dependent salary man, with the working man and the businessman having a sort of semi-dependence. Similarly, we can draw a line of increasing asset independence from the highly independent working man to the highly dependent businessman.</p>
    
    <p> These dimensions are illustrated in this figure, which provides another way of looking at the types. This can be thought of as an alternative four types or a further splitting into octants to more precisely describe the leanings of a person. In the latter case, each of the four types fall into a given wing. The nomenclature of the figure should be self-evident.</p>
    
    <p> For example, a Renaissance man could be leaning towards asset-backed job independence of a businessman (Rb) or he could be leaning towards the jack-of-all-trades approach to job independence of a working man (Rw). Similarly, the salary man could lean towards starting a side business or investing in stocks to provide more income to replace or add to some of his job income (Sb), or he could reduce his need for job income by divesting some of the things he has financed and finding ways to do more and spend less (Sw). A working man could engage in longer-term consulting projects (Ws).
An alternative way of looking at behaviors in terms of dependence on financing and having a job.</p>
    
    <p> Taken together with the previous figure,
this describes eight types.
Independence is not something one has; rather, it is something that one is. This is good news, because it means that it is possible to change one's behavior and economic interactions in a way that fosters greater independence, or less, if so desired. The salary man can work on reducing his dependence on money by learning and creating alternative solutions,
thus reducing his dependence on a job.</p>
    
    <p> Such activities are best started through one's hobbies. Similarly, the working man can also learn to create solutions rather than buying them--in particular, it is quite likely that the working man will already be creating some of his own solutions, like car repair, lawn maintenance, plumbing, etc. This could free up money for his legacy or charity, or the money could simply be used to buy time for early retirement. Finally, the businessman can discover other forms of profit than strictly monetary, like social and environmental.</p>
    
    <p> Health and good relations could just as easily be optimized, and when business size is subject to diminishing returns, why not aim for a smaller but more efficient business (see Appropriate response)? That is, the business of finding solutions for just a handful of people rather than leveraged solutions that control and serve thousands or millions of people. Doing this, the businessman will find that the leveraged bond eventually eases and money will flow to him freely.
Succession and the cycle of change As mentioned in Economic classifications, different types dominate a culture during different periods. It's possible to model this change as an ecological succession of groups of four different agent species--Renaissance men, businessmen, salary men, and working men--where each type feeds on the culture created by the previous type, but, in turn, sets up the next dominant type, which eventually will suppress and dominate it.</p>
    
    <p>
In nature, succession is initiated by the formation of new, unoccupied habitat--for example, through lava flow, wildfires, or colonization. If soil is not present, the barren land is first populated by pioneer plants like moss and lichen that can live in cracks, where water and dissolved minerals collect. These plants break down the rock into its mineral components and form soil when they decompose. The soil, whether already present or formed in the aforementioned process, is populated with annual weeds,
which also die and contribute to the soil formation.</p>
