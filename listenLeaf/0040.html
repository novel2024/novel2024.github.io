Myth #12: Your ex is a psycho Truth: A relationship ended on a sour note. This does not make any of you a psycho.
A lot of people are fond of referring to their exes as psychos.</p>
    
    <p> Every once in a while, a relationship will end on a good note where both parties go on to become great friends for the rest of their lives.

Before you call your ex a psychopath, evaluate the signs elaborated in this book and find out whether your ex’s behavior matches any of these.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, this should not matter if you are done with the relationship, but it might help you avoid falling into the same trap of dating someone who exhibits the same signs.

Alexander the Great Son of Philip II of Macedon and Olympias, Alexander the Great was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom known as Macedon and a raging narcissist as well. Alexander believed that he was destined for greatness and that anything that existed within his imagination was attainable in real life,
regardless of the expense. His mother did not make things any better for him--she had lofty ambitions for him. He sought to actualize these ambitions all his life, and it is no wonder that he ended up being named ‘the Great’ in recognition of his fierce achievement as an unrivaled military commander.</p>
    
    <p>
Perhaps the greatest indication that Alexander was a narcissist is the fact that he thought of himself as a deity. In other words, he thought himself to be a god. Again, his mother had led him to believe that he was the son of Zeus,
the king of the Greek gods. Further, Alexander was fond of downplaying his own father’s achievements to his friends.</p>
    
    <p> In his eyes, these achievements did not matter, and the only wins that counted were those that had his name on them. He was constantly worried that his father did not leave him any legacy that counted.
In response, he made it his business to win as many battles as he could. He took his army on endless battles in a quest for his own personal glory.</p>
    
    <p> It did not matter who lost their lives or got injured. Alexander was on a mission to create his own legacy, and anything or anyone who stood in his way was the enemy.
