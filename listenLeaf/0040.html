    <p> At a moment when we cannot quite put words to a concept we’re struggling to comprehend, we can still move our hands in a way that captures some aspect of our emerging understanding. We may then be able to use the experience of making and seeing our own gesture to help us locate the appropriate language. It’s possible, too, that we feel freer to try out new ideas in movement before committing to them in speech; as Susan Goldin-Meadow puts it, “Gesture encourages experimentation.” The role played by gesture in consolidating our initially inchoate thoughts is revealed by the changes our hand motions undergo as we begin to master new material.</p>
    
    <p> At first we gesture profusely, and rather indiscriminately, as we attempt to wrap our heads around an unfamiliar idea. We gesture more when we are actively trying to apprehend or reason about a concept than when we are describing a concept we already understand. Gesturing also increases as a function of difficulty: the more challenging the problem, and the more options that exist for solving it, the more we gesture in response. Meanwhile, we engage in what one researcher calls “muddled talk”—speech that is a jumble of incompletely articulated notions.</p>
    
    <p> Our speech and our gesture are not yet coordinated or congruent; so cognitively demanding is the task of assimilating a new idea that we divide the work between our head and our hands, each going its own way for now.
The process may be messy, but it allows us to circle ever closer to the attainment of complex knowledge that would otherwise remain out of reach.
While moving our hands around, we may find that our gestures summon insights of which we had previously been unaware; psychologist Barbara Tversky has likened gesturing to a “virtual diagram” we draw in the air, one we can use to stabilize and advance our emerging understanding. As our comprehension deepens, our language becomes more precise and our movements become more defined.</p>
    
    <p> Gestures are less frequent, and more coordinated in meaning and timing with the words we say. Our hand motions are now more oriented toward communicating with others and less about scaffolding our own thinking.
Without gesture’s initial assist, however, this happy state might never have been reached. Research shows that people who are asked to write on complex topics,
instead of being allowed to talk and gesture about them, end up reasoning less astutely and drawing fewer inferences.</p>
    
    <p>
This same sequence unfolds not only for novices learning a subject for the first time, but also for experts venturing into uncharted territory. Gesture is especially useful in supporting the provisional understandings shared by team members who together are working their way toward new discoveries. This was evident in a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego. Amaya Becvar and two colleagues analyzed hours of videotape recorded at the lab meetings of a biochemistry research group on the UCSD campus.</p>
    
    <p> The scientists in this lab were studying the dynamics of blood clotting, with a particular focus on an enzyme called thrombin. Depending on which protein attaches to thrombin’s “active site,” blood clots are either formed or broken down. Determining how and why thrombin binds to one protein or another could guide the design of drugs to treat heart attacks and strokes—conditions that are caused by aberrant blood clots. The lab’s scientists had a hunch that a key role was played by thrombomodulin, a protein that is a “binding partner” of thrombin.</p>
    
    <p>
At one of the lab’s weekly meetings, a graduate student presented new research on thrombomodulin to two other graduate students and a professor, the group’s research adviser. Responding to the new findings, the professor used her left hand to represent a thrombin molecule, curling her fingers into a claw and pointing to her palm. “That’s the active site,” she explained. “Our new theory is that thrombomodulin does something like this”—she curled each of her spread fingers more tightly.</p>
    
    <p> Or, she added, perhaps it has an effect “like this”—and she drew her fingers tightly together. Throughout the rest of the meeting, Becvar notes, the professor and the graduate students continually reproduced the “thrombin hand” gesture: pointing to it, talking at it, shifting the position of their fingers to represent various potential configurations. The scientists’ creation of new knowledge was actively supported by the symbolic movements of their hands, Becvar concludes—a fact acknowledged by the title of her article,
“Hands As Molecules.” Gestures are especially useful in the effort to understand concepts that words will always fail to capture fully—concepts that are visual and image-rich, that pertain to the relation between objects or ideas, or that concern entities beyond direct perception (those things tiny as an atom or vast as the solar system).</p>
