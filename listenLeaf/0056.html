    <p> For the creative person, the retooling happens subconsciously, and when the retooling is complete, inspiration suddenly strikes. This means that it's perfectly possible to switch between things, even rapidly, according to where the inspiration strikes. For instance, at any one time I have four to six simultaneous projects going. If I restricted myself to just one project for the sake of simplicity, or tried to switch projects on a pre-arranged schedule dictated by time management, there would be a lot of downtime when my subconscious was processing a problem while I would be sitting around doing nothing and being underutilized.</p>
    
    <p> Hence, not allowing yourself to do anything but focus on one specific task will actually not increase productivity for creative work. It will only increase productivity for assembly line work (see Economic degrees of freedom) or the management thereof.
If the dynamic dependence between parts is reduced or eliminated,
failure does not require a dynamic fix. One can either fix it instantly or simply leave it be and declare the part dead.</p>
    
    <p> The lack of cascading interactions increases resilience. It should be clear that the more diverse and independent the parts of the system are, and the more complex the system itself is, the greater its survival rate. Conversely, a simple, specialized system with interdependent parts, like a career professional, is likely to break as soon as circumstances change (see this figure andÂ this figure). The dynamic response of a single part can further be reduced by introducing reserve capacity (a buffer), which ensures the ability to maintain a dynamic response over a greater range of circumstances.</p>
    
    <p> Closely related is the increase of peak effort, as it makes what was previously extreme, normal. In some cases maintaining this reserve has a maintenance cost, but in many cases it does not.
Strategy,
tactics,
and guiding principles The development of a strategy follows the progression given in Gauging mastery--copying -> comparing -> compiling -> computing -> coordinating -> creating, and parallels the development of expertise. The first two levels, copying and comparing, correspond to defining an objective--that is, a goal, such as getting out of debt, becoming a millionaire, retiring early, or running a marathon.</p>
    
    <p> The next two levels,
compiling and computing, correspond to following a plan, which is a sequence of individual actions or tactics ("tips" in personal finance parlance). Don't confuse a plan with a strategy. A plan comprises a goal and a sequence of actions, but it doesn't describe the guiding principles. A strategy requires all three ingredients and thus requires coordination and creativity.</p>
    
    <p>
Now, there are many plans available on the market following a permutation of a formula of the type, "X days/tips to success in Y using the Z method," where X is a number (typically 7, 21, 30, or 365 days or 10, 12,
50, or 100 tips), Y is something desirable (typically $1,000,000, losing weight, getting a date, etc.), and Z is some kind of secret or, often, the author's autobiography. A plan can be thought of as a sequential set of instructions. "If you do this, followed by this and that, and several additional steps, you'll end up at the goal.</p>
    
    <p>" Plans work well if the number of degrees of freedom (see Economic degrees of freedom) is limited so that few things can go wrong--that is, not according to plan. However, the more complex the situation--and life is generally more complex than assembling a piece of Swedish furniture--the greater the chance of something going wrong due to unknown unknowns--uncertain factors that nobody is aware of, also known as surprises,
unknown knowns--certain factors that you're not aware of, meaning that you got the wrong plan, also known as "I told you so",
known unknowns--uncertain factors that you are aware of, meaning that the plan is correct but lacking precision, also known as bad luck or bad design.
The construction of a plan--that is, the way the tactics are coordinated and created--follows a set of guiding principles. If a plan shows how to put instructions together, then guiding principles show how to put a plan together and create a strategy.</p>
    
    <p> Strategic thinking--that is, the creation of plans--is what separates the last two levels, coordinating and creating, from the first four levels. Compared to a plan, which may be thought of as a string of actions, subject to complete failure if it breaks, a strategy is better thought of as a web of actions. A web does not fail catastrophically if it's cut in a single, or even a few places. It's resilient, whereas a plan is not.</p>
