    <p>” This emotional reaction to the sight of Earth—to its beauty, to its fragility—is one persistent motif noted by David Yaden, a research fellow at Johns Hopkins University who has studied astronauts’ accounts of their flights. A second recurring theme is the dissolution of the boundaries and barriers that divide those of us here on the ground. From up in outer space, recounted astronaut Rusty Schweickart, “you identify with Houston and then you identify with Los Angeles and Phoenix and New Orleans . .</p>
    
    <p> . and that whole process of what it is you identify with begins to shift when you go around the Earth . . .</p>
    
    <p> You look down and see the surface of that globe you’ve lived on all this time, and you know all those people down there and they are like you, they are you . . . You recognize that you’re a piece of this total life.</p>
    
    <p>” Astronaut Edgar Mitchell recalled an “explosion of awareness” upon seeing Earth from space, an experience that gave him an “overwhelming sense of oneness and connectedness.” Paradoxically, the intense feelings of connection felt by space travelers are often pierced by equally powerful feelings of dislocation and alienation. When they’re not marveling at the sight of Earth on the horizon, astronauts must contend with what many describe as a stultifying environment, tightly confined,
filled with highly technical instruments but with none of the features that ease or delight the human mind. The result may be boredom, ennui, anxiety, even aggression toward other crew members.</p>
    
    <p> How to preserve the psychological well- being of astronauts has emerged as a compelling question as the prospect of long-term space travel draws closer. One possible answer has already shown some promise: have them grow green things.
When NASA astronaut Michael Foale arrived at the joint American-Russian space station Mir in 1997, one of the tasks he was assigned was tending to the station’s greenhouse. He carried out a variety of experiments intended to investigate how plants grow in space; if astronauts are to spend months and even years onboard, they will need to have a supply of fresh food.</p>
    
    <p> And indeed, Foale did succeed in growing, and tasting, what the astronauts called “space broccoli.” That required figuring out how to use light to guide the broccoli seedlings in the right direction; without gravity, they didn’t know to grow “up.” Without bees to pollinate the mizuna (a salad green), Foale himself had to do the job, gently transferring pollen from one plant to another with a toothpick.
Foale took such care with his plants that the team on the ground at NASA nicknamed him “Farmer Foale.</p>
    
    <p>” But the space garden was of more than utilitarian value. “I loved the greenhouse experiment,” said Foale at a press conference after returning from Mir. Maintaining a greenhouse on a long-range space flight, such as a trip to Mars, “would be essential,” Foale added, “because there would be so little to do in that long period in between planets, and growing and tending plants is certainly a very soothing thing to do.” Of the plants under his care, he said, “I enjoyed looking at them every morning for about ten, fifteen minutes.</p>
    
    <p> It was a moment of quiet time.” Psychologists who study the psyches of astronauts—many of whom already spend months at a time on space stations orbiting Earth—use a telling word for the malaise that many experience: such individuals, they say, are “homesick.” It’s possible to perceive an unsettling similarity between these space travelers,
starved for the Earth they can see only through a window, and ourselves—sealed in our capsules of home and car and office, separated from the verdant vegetation, fresh air, and ever-shifting sunlight that is our natural habitat. When we’re outdoors, “we feel ‘at home’ because we remain, in part, the children of our ancestral past,” the architect Harry Francis Mallgrave has written.</p>
