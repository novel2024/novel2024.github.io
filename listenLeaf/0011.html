    <p> The biggest cost of a startup is often the salary you need to pay yourself to live. Not having to pay this out of company funds allows you to invest the money back into the company.
In addition, you can focus all your effort on the company instead of working other jobs to support yourself.
Do you dream of doing instead of having things?
Is your job getting in the way of doing what you want to do? Nobody lives forever and sooner or later people realize that their lifespan is finite and that someday they're going to die.</p>
    
    <p> This revelation occurs retrospectively when people hit their forties and ponder what they've done with their life so far. It's called a mid-life crisis. The question you need to answer is what you want to do with your life given that you don't have the time to do everything? Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest of a 30-year mortgage and working so you can fill increasingly bigger houses with increasingly more stuff while being stuck in your daily commute in increasingly nicer cars? Or are you prepared to give up the stuff so that you can do whatever you want, whenever, and wherever, within reason? What will your legacy be--what you owned or who you were?
Do you believe life is an adventure?
The average man leads a predictable, some would say boring, life. He is expected to get a college degree and a career, buy the things that are advertised on TV, get married and have children, and then get a mortgage and a retirement plan.</p>
    
    <p> Our culture of conformity doesn't allow much choice. Do you find it difficult to accept this constraint of choice? Do you find it difficult to pursue your passions when you have to hold onto a full-time job to pay all the bills? Does your job zap your creative energies? Many people, particularly young people, are starting to realize that the pursuit of happiness isn't found through the pursuit of accumulating things. They don't drop out, they opt out and forge their own path, starting up Internet companies, traveling the world, and retiring early from the rat race so they can spend their lives living rather than just buying stuff. Which do you prefer?
Do you want to make a difference?
The "system," which many of us like to blame our problems on and yet count on for our solutions, is not really governed by a mysterious group referred to as "them.</p>
    
    <p>" The world that we live in is the aggregate sum of the individual behavior of all of us. "They" are not responsible for our world. We are! You are! Unless you are a dictator, a rock star,
or another person with enough influence to facilitate a top-down approach with decrees or manifestos, the most effective change starts with individuals using a bottom-up approach. You have to become the change you want to see.</p>
    
    <p> You have to set an example for other people to follow. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
Unfortunately, many people in our culture are part of the problem.
We're concerned about our dependence on oil imports and the resulting wars, yet we drive 30 miles to work every day to pay the bills.</p>
    
    <p> We're very much locked into an economic and behavioral model that conflicts with our values. What other choice do we have? Well, read on!
Society offers you a deal: Get a student loan; get a college degree; get a mortgage and become a homeowner; build your life with a deck of credit cards. Just sign on the dotted line and before you know it, you're on the hook for a house, a car, the basic "human needs" of cable TV, fancy restaurant visits, cell phone and gym subscriptions, and a house full of toys.
After a few years, it'll be hard to imagine life without all that stuff.</p>
    
    <p> You will, therefore, spend all your life working in a possibly unfulfilling job to pay the bills for all the things you signed up for. If your job brings you down, you buy something on credit as a reward, dragging you further into the spiral of addiction. You'll be living in a virtual debtor's prison, except you'll only see the bars if you miss a payment. If you have debt, you're not a free person.</p>
    
    <p> You're explicitly owned by your debt and implicitly owned by the creditor. You put 15% of your income into a retirement account for 40 years, plan to retire at 65, then try to spend the remainder of your life making up for lost time and health. Are you willing to take that deal? If not,
there's another way: Don't accept the chains; leave the cave.
Changing your frame of mind is key to escaping, but change is a challenge.</p>
