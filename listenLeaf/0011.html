    <p> The loss of his usually ever-present computer hit him, he later wrote, “like a sudden and somewhat vicious type of (hopefully transient) brain damage.” He was left “dazed, confused, and visibly enfeebled— the victim of the cyborg equivalent of a mild stroke.” The experience, distressing as it was, provided fodder for a notion he had been pondering for some time. His computer, he realized, had in a sense become a part of his mind, an integral element of his thinking processes.</p>
    
    <p> His mental capacities were effectively extended by the use of his laptop, allowing his brain to overachieve—to think more efficiently and effectively, more intelligently, than it could without the device. His brain plus his computer equaled his mind, extended.
Two years earlier, Clark and his colleague David Chalmers had coauthored an article that named and described just this phenomenon. Their paper, titled “The Extended Mind,” began by posing a question that would seem to have an obvious answer.</p>
    
    <p> “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” it asked. Clark and Chalmers went on to offer an unconventional response. The mind does not stop at the standard “demarcations of skin and skull,” they argued.
Rather, it is more accurately viewed as “an extended system, a coupling of biological organism and external resources.</p>
    
    <p>” A recognition of this reality, they acknowledged, “will have significant consequences”—in terms of “philosophical views of the mind,” but also “in moral and social domains.” The authors were aware that the vision they were setting out would require a thorough reimagining of what people are like and how they function, a reimagining they saw as necessary and right. Once “the hegemony of skin and skull is usurped,” they concluded, “we may be able to see ourselves more truly as creatures of the world.” The world, at first, was not so sure.</p>
    
    <p> Before being published in Analysis in 1998, the paper received rejections from three other journals. Once in print, “The Extended Mind” was greeted with perplexity—and no small amount of derision.
But the idea it proposed turned out to have surprising power, within the academy and well beyond it. What at first appeared radical and out-there quickly came to seem less so, as daily life in the digital age provided a continuous proof-of- concept demonstration of people extending their minds with their devices.</p>
    
    <p>
Initially derided as wacky, the notion of the extended mind came to seem eminently plausible, even prescient.
In the more than twenty years since the publication of “The Extended Mind,” the idea it introduced has become an essential umbrella concept under which a variety of scientific sub-fields have gathered. Embodied cognition, situated cognition, distributed cognition: each of these takes up a particular aspect of the extended mind, investigating how our thinking is extended by our bodies, by the spaces in which we learn and work, and by our interactions with other people.
Such research has not only produced new insights into the nature of human cognition; it has also generated a corpus of evidence-based methods for extending the mind.</p>
    
    <p>
That’s where this book comes in: it aims to operationalize the extended mind,
to turn this philosophical sally into something practically useful. In chapter 1,
we’ll learn how to tune in to our interoception—the sensations that arise from within the body—and how to use these signals to make sounder decisions. In chapter 2, we’ll find out how moving our bodies can nudge our minds toward deeper understanding. Chapter 3 looks at how the gestures we make with our hands can bolster our memory.</p>
    
    <p> Chapter 4 examines how time spent in natural spaces can restore our depleted attention. In chapter 5, we’ll see how built spaces —the interiors we inhabit at school and at work—can be designed to promote creativity. In chapter 6, we will explore how moving our thoughts out of our heads and into “the space of ideas” can lead us to new insights and discoveries.
Chapter 7 probes how we can think with the minds of experts; chapter 8 considers how we can think with classmates, colleagues, and other peers.</p>
