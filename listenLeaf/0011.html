    <p> Such internal reports are merged with several otherstreams of information—our active thoughts and memories, sensory inputsgathered from the external world—and integrated into a single snapshot of ourpresent condition, a sense of “how I feel” in the moment, as well as a sense ofthe actions we must take to maintain a state of internal balance.All of us experience these bodily signals—but some of us feel them morekeenly than others. To measure interoceptive awareness, scientists apply theheartbeat detection test, the one John Coates used with his group of financialtraders: test takers are asked to identify the instant when their heart beats,without placing a hand on the chest or resting a finger on a wrist. Researchershave found a surprisingly wide range in terms of how people score.</p>
    
    <p> Someindividuals are interoceptive champions, able to determine accurately andconsistently when their heartbeats happen. Others are interoceptive duds: theycan’t feel the rhythm. Few of us are aware that this spectrum of ability evenexists, much less where we fall on it—so preoccupied are we with moreconventionally brainbound capacities. We may remember down to the point ourSAT scores or our high school GPA, but we haven’t given this particularaptitude a moment’s thought.</p>
    
    <p>Vivien Ainley recalls a clear demonstration of this common oversight. Ainley,an interoception researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, wasadministering the heartbeat detection test to members of the public as part of anexhibit at London’s Science Museum. Visitors to the exhibit were instructed toplace a finger on a sensor that detected their pulse; the readout of the sensor wasvisible only to Ainley.“Please tell me when your heart beats,” she would say to each patron whostepped forward.</p>
    
    <p> An elderly couple who stopped by the booth had very differentreactions to Ainley’s request.“How on earth would I know what my heart is doing?” the woman askedincredulously. Her husband turned and stared at her, equally dumbfounded.“But of course you know,” he exclaimed.</p>
    
    <p> “Don’t be so stupid, everyoneknows what their heartbeat is!”“He had always been able to hear his heart, and she had never been able tohear hers,” Ainley observed in an interview, smiling at the memory. “They hadbeen married for decades, but they had never talked of or even recognized thisdifference between them.”Though we may not notice such differences, they are real, and even visible toscientists using brain-scanning technology: the size and activity level of thebrain’s interoceptive hub, the insula, vary among individuals and are correlatedwith their awareness of interoceptive sensations. How such differences arise inthe first place is not yet known.</p>
    
    <p> All of us begin life with our interoceptivecapacities already operating; interoceptive awareness continues to developacross childhood and adolescence. Differences in sensitivity to internal signalsmay be influenced by genetic factors, as well as by the environments in whichwe grow up, including the communications we receive from caregivers abouthow we should respond to our bodily prompts.What we do know is that interoceptive awareness can be deliberatelycultivated. A series of simple exercises can put us in touch with the messagesemanating from within, giving us access to knowledge that we already possessbut that is ordinarily excluded from consciousness—knowledge about ourselves,about other people, and about the worlds through which we move.</p>
    
    <p> Once weestablish contact with this informative internal source, we can make wise use ofwhat it has to tell us: to make sounder decisions, for example; to respond moreresiliently to challenges and setbacks; to savor more fully the intensity of ourresiliently to challenges and setbacks; to savor more fully the intensity of ouremotions while also managing them more skillfully; and to connect to otherswith more sensitivity and insight. The heart, and not the head, leads the way.TO UNDERSTAND HOW interoception can act as such a rich repository, it’simportant to recognize that the world is full of far more information than ourconscious minds can process. Fortunately, we are also able to collect and storethe volumes of information we encounter on a non-conscious basis.</p>
    
    <p> As weproceed through each day, we are continuously apprehending and storingregularities in our experience, tagging them for future reference. Through thisinformation-gathering and pattern-identifying process, we come to know things—but we’re typically not able to articulate the content of such knowledge or toascertain just how we came to know it. This trove of data remains mostly underthe surface of consciousness, and that’s usually a good thing. Its submergedstatus preserves our limited stores of attention and working memory for otheruses.</p>
    
    <p>A study led by cognitive scientist Pawel Lewicki demonstrates this process inmicrocosm. Participants in Lewicki’s experiment were directed to watch acomputer screen on which a cross-shaped target would appear, then disappear,then reappear in a new location; periodically they were asked to predict wherethe target would show up next. Over the course of several hours of exposure tothe target’s movements, the participants’ predictions grew more and moreaccurate. They had figured out the pattern behind the target’s peregrinations.</p>
    
    <p> Butthey could not put this knowledge into words, even when the experimentersoffered them money to do so. The subjects were not able to describe “anythingeven close to the real nature” of the pattern, Lewicki observes. The movementsof the target operated according to a pattern too complex for the conscious mindto accommodate—but the capacious realm that lies below consciousness wasmore than roomy enough to contain it.“Nonconscious information acquisition,” as Lewicki calls it, along with theensuing application of such information, is happening in our lives all the time.</p>
