High Machs are highly opportunistic While other people go through life smelling the flowers and doing other cliché things that make normal people happy, high Machs look at life as a game where they must win. They think of life as a giant chess board where every move must get you closer to winning. As such, high Machs are highly opportunistic and will leap at every chance they can grab to get ahead. They have no concern for others on the chessboard because they believe that there can only be one king while the rest stay on as pawns to be used as instruments for the achievement of power and status.</p>
    
    <p>
High Machs are emotionally detached High Machs have the uncanny ability to remain emotionally detached from every situation that they are in. They avoid commitments and will often make very frustrating relationship partners. For high Machs, emotions and feelings are just distractions that will keep them from achieving their goals.
If you are married to a high Mach, you might find yourself very lonely when all family time is replaced with work commitments.</p>
    
    <p> To the high Mach, work must be done, so that power and money are achieved. It does not matter to them that they are neglecting their family. They simply must do what needs to be done. This, however, does not mean that every workaholic is a high Mach.</p>
    
    <p> However, more often than not, this is usually the case.
Because of their ability to detach their emotions from situations, high Machs are also prone to having numerous sexual encounters, often with people they are not well-acquainted with. There are two reasons for this.
Oscar Wilde once said this: everything in human life really is about sex,
except sex.</p>
    
    <p> Sex is about power. Nobody relates to this better than a high Mach who has convinced yet another conquest to join him in bed. The second reason for the numerous sexual partners is the ability for emotional detachment, which allows a high Mach to jump from person to person without feeling any sort of commitment to anyone.
High Machs lack empathy Empathy is defined as the ability to share the feelings of another.</p>
    
    <p> Seeing that high Machs are not emotionally attuned to people or situations, it goes without saying that they are not exactly in the best position to be empathetic. This lack of empathy also works to their benefit in that they can easily harm others to get ahead without blinking. After all, if you are incapable of feeling someone’s pain, you really have no problem causing them the pain in the first place.
High Machs make good teammates but not good friends When you are competing in a sport or in a debate, you want to get the teammate who will help you win the top prize.</p>
    
    <p> Because of their competitiveness and willingness to use any means to get ahead, high Machs make very good teammates in competitive scenarios. The same cannot be said for personal relationships. While many people will rush to team up with a high Mach, not too many will be willing to date them or be best friends with them. This is simply because they do not make very good friends.</p>
    
    <p> A high Mach will throw you under the bus at the drop of a hat even if you have been friends for years. Then again, high Machs do not really make friends--they simply collect pawns and instruments for later use.
High Machs are often mysterious Since they believe they are playing a game, high Machs rarely put their hearts on their sleeves. They are hard to figure out and will often come across as aloof.</p>
