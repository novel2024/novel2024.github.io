    <p> Get furniture used and make this your norm. Mention that this month your expenses were completely covered by income from your investment accounts. Volunteer for housework. The golden rule of volunteering is that the volunteer gets to do it his way.</p>
    
    <p> If you want to eat better for less, volunteer to cook. If you want to save money on cleaning supplies, start making them yourself. This takes leadership abilities, but if not you, then who?
None of this guarantees success, but maybe, just maybe someday your spouse will have a problem that is best solved using one of your solutions,
and you'll be right there.
Children Sometimes the question of children and how they factor into extreme early retirement comes up.</p>
    
    <p> We don't have children, so what follows are my purely theoretical thoughts on raising a child and how it would impact early retirement, and the child.
Most importantly, it should be realized that children don't spend a lot of money; rather, their parents do! This means that raising a child costs as much as you can afford. It is certainly possible to clothe and feed a child for $100/month just like it is possible to clothe and feed an adult for that amount. Beyond this, all they need is love, learning, activity, and responsibilities.</p>
    
    <p> You can either pay for someone else to provide this or you can provide it yourself. Most arguments will originate in the belief that it is normal, needed, or even desirable to pay someone else to provide these services.
I believe that having a stay-at-home parent is a very good idea, and I don't think I'd want it otherwise. I had a stay-at-home parent myself.</p>
    
    <p> My mom stayed home full-time for the first six years of my life and after we started going to school she took a part-time job, so we never came home to an empty house. This naturally goes very well with the idea of early retirement. Not only does financial independence and early retirement automatically allow for someone who stays at home; it doesn't delay the working spouse from early retirement in the sense that they don't have to provide for two people, since the retired adult is already providing investment income. This is also a good argument for achieving financial independence before having children--it only takes five years!
I wouldn't send my children off to cello lessons, travel soccer, or preschool where they could pretend to be intellectually stimulated at a rate of $1,500/month by learning a few words of Mandarin.</p>
    
    <p> I suspect children cost exactly as much as you're capable of spending. You can buy their clothes at thrift stores, just like you buy your own, or you can buy designer outfits for them just as you buy designer outfits for yourself. Their entertainment can match your own. I don't believe in the necessity of everybody having their own room.</p>
    
    <p> Again, this comes down to social skills.
Sharing used to be normal; ask your parents or grandparents. There are certainly happy families on cruising boats where nobody has their own room. It can be done.</p>
    
    <p>
Essentially, love and caring would be demonstrated through spending time together rather than spending money. I would make sure they did their homework. I would encourage inexpensive and creative hobbies. There would be chores in the form of housework since everybody would contribute in their own way.</p>
