On this scale there is no demarcation of when a need becomes a want.
Each step is slightly different and slightly more expensive than the previous step, with no clear indication of what the bare minimum is, other than having somewhere to sleep.</p>
    
    <p> At what point, then, does a want become a need?
It could be argued that sleeping under open air in Alaska or Finland will kill you, and that some form of shelter is therefore a need. However, it's possible for people living in Finland or Alaska to move south so shelter isn't an absolute need. Rather, it's shelter in Finland or Alaska that is an absolute need--insofar that staying alive is a need, but nobody needs to live in Finland or Alaska, even though I'm sure those are nice places.45 Even though the rankings on this list probably match the rankings of most people, it's by no means universal.</p>
    
    <p> Having experienced the freedom of living in an RV or a boat for a while, some people would never dream of substituting this for a 4,000square-foot McMansion with its endless cleaning and maintenance issues, and the need for walkie-talkies to find lost family members. The list is individual, because any choice has consequences in other domains (see Contingency goal-setting).
For each individual, there are similar lists for eating, clothing,
transportation, health, time, tools, toys, activities, status, etc., each ranging from essentially zero cost to more than one can imagine.</p>
    
    <p> These can also be classified into tangibles like air, water, food, sanitary, shelter,
communication, transport, health, and security, and intangibles, like time,
relationships, affiliation, power, and achievement. Some of these, like security and sanitation, we take for granted living in the developed world.
For others, except perhaps air and clean water, there's a large range of possible "consumption" levels. For instance, the eating list ranges from roadkill and dumpster diving, to industrially processed "food," to gourmet meals and fine dining.</p>
    
    <p> Clothing ranges from going naked to owning just one set of clothes, to owning massive wardrobes full of shoes and tailor-made suits. Transportation ranges from walking barefoot to driving a "hooptie," to private airplanes and megayachts. Health ranges from being strong (physically and mentally), to being on prescription medicines, to being entirely dependent on advanced medical infrastructure. Time ranges from being a galley slave, to working 8-10-hour days in a tolerable job, to doing what you want, which may or may not include what is otherwise classified as work.</p>
