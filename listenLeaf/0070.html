    <p> The method of loci—also known as the “memory palace” strategy, or in Pridmore’s phrasing, the “journey technique”—is remarkably effective. On their own, bits of data like the number or suit shown on a playing card are quickly forgotten. But when linked to a physical place we know well, that same information can be durably integrated into memory.
Pridmore is not the only memory champion to make use of the method of loci.</p>
    
    <p>
Indeed, research conducted with other memory contest winners has concluded that the strategy of tying new information to preexisting memories of physical space is the key to the extraordinary performance of many of these “memory athletes.” One such study was conducted by Eleanor Maguire, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. “Using neuropsychological measures, as well as structural and functional brain imaging,
we found that superior memory was not driven by exceptional intellectual ability or structural brain differences,” Maguire and her coauthors reported. “Rather, we found that superior memorizers used a spatial learning strategy, engaging brain regions such as the hippocampus that are critical for memory and for spatial memory in particular.</p>
    
    <p>” The difference between “superior memorizers” and ordinary people, Maguire determined, lay in the parts of the brain that became active when the two groups engaged in the act of recall; in the memory champions’ brains, regions associated with spatial memory and navigation were highly engaged, while in ordinary people these areas were much less active.
What sets memory champs apart, then, is their conscious cultivation of an ability every one of us comes by naturally—the capacity to find our way around and to remember where we’ve been. Research has found that all of us seem to use the brain’s built-in navigational system to construct mental maps, not just of physical places but of the more abstract landscape of concepts and data—the space of ideas. This repurposing of our sense of physical place to navigate through purely mental structures is reflected in the language we use every day:
we say the future lies “up ahead,” while the past is “behind” us; we endeavor to stay “on top of things” and not to get “out of our depth”; we “reach” for a lofty goal or “stoop” low to commit a disreputable act.</p>
    
    <p> These are not merely figures of speech but revealing evidence of how we habitually understand and interact with the world around us. Notes Barbara Tversky, a professor of psychology and education at Teachers College in New York: “We are far better and more experienced at spatial thinking than at abstract thinking. Abstract thought can be difficult in and of itself, but fortunately it can often be mapped onto spatial thought in one way or another. That way, spatial thinking can substitute for and scaffold abstract thought.</p>
    
    <p>” Scientists have long known that the hippocampus is centrally involved in our ability to navigate through physical space. More recently, researchers have shown that this region is engaged in organizing our thoughts and memories more generally: it maps abstract spaces as well as concrete ones. In a study published in 2016, neuroscientist Branka Milivojevic, of the Donders Institute for Brain,
Cognition and Behaviour in the Netherlands, scanned the brains of a group of volunteers as they watched the 1998 movie Sliding Doors. In this romantic comedy-drama, the main character, Helen—played by actress Gwyneth Paltrow —meets two different fates.</p>
    
    <p> In one storyline, she makes it onto a train and returns home in time to find her boyfriend in bed with another woman. In a second, parallel storyline, she misses the train and remains oblivious to her boyfriend’s infidelity. As the study participants watched the film, Milivojevic and her collaborators observed activity in their hippocampi identical to that of people who are mentally tracing a path through a physical space. Milivojevic proposes that the viewers of Sliding Doors were effectively navigating through the events of the movie, finding their way along its branching plotline and constructing a map of the cinematic territory as they went.</p>
    
    <p> We process our firsthand experiences in the same manner, she submits.
Some researchers have even suggested that the way our sense of space helps organize mental content can explain the puzzling phenomenon of “infantile amnesia”—the fact that we can’t recall much about our earliest years. Because very young children are not able to move through space under their own locomotion, the theory goes, they may lack a mental scaffold on which to hang their memories. Children’s impressions of their own experiences may become well enough structured to be memorable only once kids are able to move about of their own volition.</p>
    
    <p> As adults, our memories continue to be tagged with a sense of the physical place where the original experience occurred. When re-listening to a podcast or audiobook, for example, we may find that we spontaneously recall the place where we first heard the words. The automatic place log maintained by our brains has been preserved by evolution because of its clear survival value: it was vitally important for our forebears to remember where they had found supplies of food or safe shelter, as well as where they had encountered predators and other dangers. The elemental importance of where such things were located means the mental tags attached to our place memories are often charged with emotion, positive or negative—making information about place even more memorable.</p>
