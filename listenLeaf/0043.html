    <p> This attitude rests either on a thorough knowledge of or training in what is to be done, or on the surety that such knowledge or training can be attained. This attitude is often transferable from one field to another, completely unrelated field. Doing something that is considered very difficult at least once in your life is highly recommended.
Our current world I submit that we currently live in a climax stage.</p>
    
    <p>21 We have a political model that is based on leading in the popular polls--a model where barely differentiated political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most people--a model where the election is won by the person with the best marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant.
We have an economic model that is based on pulling resources out of the ground and mostly turning them into unnecessary products, getting people to buy the products by convincing them that they need them, then getting them to throw the products away because they're obsolete. This makes people buy the next model and bury the other one in the ground. The sole goal of this seemingly pointless exercise is to work faster and grow the gross domestic product, which measures the resource churn.</p>
    
    <p>
We live in a world where the money necessary for our way of life comes out of a slit in the wall as long as we keep showing up for work, yet only experts understand the fiat-based money/credit system. We live in a world where food can be heated in a microwave oven at the touch of a button, yet only experts understand how this works. This goes for most of the other technology we use. All we know is that if we press this or that button,
things magically happen.</p>
    
    <p>
We are aware of large-scale problems, but most of us believe that we can't do anything about them. Instead, we believe in a mythical They who will find a solution, just like They have provided all this wonderful technology we surround ourselves with.
We may be more technologically advanced as a group, and correctly but myopically hold up technology as our one indicator of "progress,"22 but in terms of individual understanding we have not come far, and once again live according to old concepts. In fact, we might have turned a full cycle from the last climax stage: The Dark Ages.</p>
    
    <p>
Leaving the Dark Ages The Dark Ages was characterized by an old and mature society set in its ways. Ruled from the top down by kings and governed by religion, it was a world of superstition and magical thinking, where the individual had few options and all cultural trends pointed towards more of the same (see The lock-in).23 It was a world ripe for new ideas.
The Dark Ages gradually ended six centuries ago with the Renaissance,
which seeded new ideas for a different world.</p>
    
    <p> The Renaissance ideal dominated our culture until three centuries ago, from the 14th to the 18th century, when it was superseded by modernism. Not surprisingly, this human ideal has almost been forgotten in our culture. The Renaissance,
literally "re-birth", was a revival and rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman culture following the decline of culture, trade, and technology during the Dark Ages. Human achievement was once again put into the center of human focus.</p>
    
    <p> A Renaissance man strove to develop his capabilities to their fullest extent.
As mentioned in Succession and the cycle of change, the colonization of new habitats, whether physical land as in the discovery of a new continent,
physiological "land" as in breaking the four-minute mile barrier, or intellectual land as in the discovery of new ideas, immediately initiates a succession.
As soon as those idea-seeds were sown, businessmen took unstructured but complex ideas and started commercializing them. Competitively, it's easier (but also riskier) to gain an advantage by leveraging complexity than it is to specialize while keeping the slack of the loose coupling, because the latter requires a lot of effort.</p>
    
    <p> Businessmen essentially move the structure from skilled artisans to factories by setting up a structure as described in The businessman. At this stage businessmen focus their efforts on competing with other businesses, until the structures for production are settled in large companies (for example, a handful of computer companies instead of the initial hundreds) and the industry is fairly stable. While businessmen may behave in a cutthroat fashion toward other companies,
they're fairly honest with their employees. There's a need for loyal employees to fill the jobs, and at this stage, the beginning of industry and the formation of the big corporations we still see today, the businessmen,
the salarymen, and the working men form a natural symbiosis.</p>
