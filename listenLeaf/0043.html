    <p> In the course of his life up until when he got caught, Dahmer went on to steal the lives of twelve more unfortunate victims.
Amy Bishop Amy Bishop was a biology professor who worked at the University of Alabama in Huntsville up until February 2010 when she walked into the university complex and killed three of her colleagues. Three other people sustained severe but non-fatal injuries from this attack. There are several reasons why Amy Bishop makes this list.</p>
    
    <p> First, Amy exhibited clear signs of narcissism when she went around letting everyone know that she had earned her Ph.D. from Harvard. It was almost the very first thing that she told you upon meeting.</p>
    
    <p> By virtue of having a degree from Harvard, Amy believed herself to be better than everyone else. She thought of herself as a capable professor who was deserving of tenure despite the fact that her students had complained about her abilities and teaching methods on numerous occasions.
Much earlier, before she killed her colleagues, Amy had shot her brother in what was later ruled as an accident. Some sources intimated that Amy might have killed her brother deliberately because he was getting the attention that she thought she deserved.</p>
    
    <p>
On the day of the murders, Amy attended a faculty meeting and sat quietly as it progressed. She appeared to be calm and just being her normal self.
About forty minutes later, Amy calmly pulled out a handgun and started shooting. She was subdued after killing three faculty members and injuring three others.</p>
    
    <p> It is interesting to note that Amy planned to kill her colleagues after getting denied tenure at the University. Despite her otherwise poor performance as a professor, Amy believed that she deserved tenure. In her mind, she was the best of the best, and nobody else had a greater right to be at the university.
Amy lost her tenure in 2009, and it was not until 2010 that she killed her colleagues.</p>
    
    <p> It is clear to see that she was cold and calculating and took the time to come up with just the right plan to eliminate her ‘enemies’ — Amy’s actions throughout her life point to a person that was highly narcissistic and psychopathic as well. A member of a writing group that Amy belonged to is cited as saying that Amy came across as a person who felt entitled to praise.
She is also said to have been abrasive in her interactions with others.
No doubt, these individuals are just a drop in the ocean of dark triad personalities that have walked on this earth.</p>
    
    <p> With psychologists suggesting that psychopaths make up about one percent of the general population, it goes without saying that making a list of all psychopaths ever to exist would be a lifelong task.
How to Talk to Your Child About Dark Psychology Other than the cases where there are classic warning signs of psychopathy such as the abuse of animals, you might have noticed that a whole lot of the personalities listed in the previous sections went through a normal childhood. If you are a parent, the safety of your children is paramount.
The kind of concern you feel towards your children extends from their interaction with other people to their own internal dialogue taking place without anybody else’s notice.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, you want to know that your child is safe when with other people and when alone as well.
It is especially disconcerting to know that there are people in this world who use their time, thoughts, and efforts to hurt children. While there is not especially much that you can do to change that kind of people, you can prepare your child to deal with the kind of people who are more likely than not to use dark psychology to take advantage of others.
Make your home your child’s safe haven Your home should be where your child feels safest.</p>
