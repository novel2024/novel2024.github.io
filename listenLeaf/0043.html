The study’s authors suggest that this discrepancy may emerge from differences in boys’ and girls’ experience: boys are more likely to play with spatially oriented toys and video games, they note, and may become more comfortable making spatial gestures as a result. Another study, this one conducted with four-year-olds, reported that children who were encouraged to gesture got better at rotating mental objects, another task that draws heavily on spatial-thinking skills. Girls in this experiment were especially likely to benefit from being prompted to gesture.
Another, more subtle approach to promoting gesture involves creating occasions for its use—setting up scenarios in which people are likely to move their hands.</p>
    
    <p> One such circumstance arises when people are asked to improvise:
that is, to come up with an explanation or a narrative on the spot, in front of an audience. Improvisation is cognitively taxing, and in the face of its demands we tend to gesture more.
Wolff-Michael Roth is a cognitive scientist at the University of Victoria in Canada. His research on the role of gesture in the development of scientific literacy has led him to change the way he conducts his courses as a professor.</p>
    
    <p>
Rather than presenting lectures in which he does most of the talking, Roth finds as many opportunities as he can to ask individual students to describe and explain the topics being covered in that day’s class. Lacking a fully developed understanding, or even the relevant technical vocabulary, his students lean heavily on gesture to convey their budding knowledge—and this is just what their professor wants to see. “It is from the attempt of expressing themselves that understanding evolves, rather than the other way around,” he maintains.
Roth is also a practitioner of another kind of occasion creation: he has observed, and research has confirmed, that people are more likely to gesture when they have something to gesture at.</p>
    
    <p> Providing what Roth calls “visual artifacts”—charts, diagrams, maps, models, photographs—induces speakers to gesture more, thus generating all the benefits for understanding that such hand motions confer. With his colleagues in the University of Victoria physics department, he has developed a set of visual depictions and concrete models that the physics professors now use to encourage gesture production in class. When standing next to such objects, students can simply point to parts or processes that they can’t yet fully describe or explain, allowing them to engage in “more mature physics talk” than would otherwise be possible at this early stage of their studies. The use of gesture supplies a temporary scaffold that supports these undergraduates’ still wobbly understanding of the subject as they fix their knowledge more firmly in place.</p>
    
    <p>
One more way to leverage the power of gesture: we can pay closer attention to the manner in which others move their hands. As we’ve discovered, people’s newest and most advanced ideas often show up first in their gestures; moreover,
individuals signal their readiness to learn when their gestures begin to diverge from their speech. In our single-minded focus on spoken language, however, we may miss the clues conveyed in this other mode. Research finds that even experienced teachers pick up on less than a third of the information contained in students’ hand movements.</p>
    
    <p> But studies also demonstrate that we can train ourselves to attend more closely to gesture’s corporeal code.
In a study carried out by Susan Goldin-Meadow and colleagues at the University of Chicago, a group of adults was recruited to watch video recordings of children solving conservation problems, like the water-pouring task we encountered earlier. They were then offered some basic information about gesture: that gestures often convey important information not found in speech,
and that they could attend not only to what people say with their words but also to what they “say” with their hands. It was suggested that they could pay particular attention to the shape of a hand gesture, to the motion of a hand gesture, and to the placement of a hand gesture.</p>
    
    <p> After receiving these simple instructions, study subjects watched the videos once more. Before the brief gesture training, the observing adults identified only around 30 to 40 percent of instances when children displayed emerging knowledge in their gestures; after receiving the training, their hit rate shot up to about 70 percent.
With a little effort, it’s possible to glean the information gesture holds, and once we do so, we have a host of new options. We can supply the insight the gesturer is reaching for—an insight for which, research suggests, she is already mentally primed; we can “translate” that individual’s gesture into words (“It looks like you’re suggesting that .</p>
    
    <p> . .”); and we can “second” her gesture by reproducing it ourselves, thereby reaffirming the promising strategy she has pointed to with her hands.
 IT’S CLEAR THAT spontaneous gestures can support intelligent thinking.</p>
