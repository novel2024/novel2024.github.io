    <p> This control is exerted by providing a choice within a narrow range. "You can choose between the following three models of cookie-cutter homes. You shouldn't modify them or your resale value will be impaired." "You can choose to drive a car subject to various rules and regulations.</p>
    
    <p>" "You can choose between the following two political candidates. You shouldn't vote for others, or your vote will be wasted." "You can choose between the following 25 different, heavily advertised breakfast cereals, but don't think of starting your day with anything but breakfast cereal." "Choose the size and type of your TV and the number of channels, but don't consider not watching TV, or you might miss out.</p>
    
    <p>" This gives the illusion of freedom while retaining control.
With both work and consumption being well-controlled, the salary man may be thought of as a brick in a wall or a cog in a machine. The associated cash flows are relatively simple. In the simplest case, time and energy flows from the specialist into a wage-earning job.</p>
    
    <p> Money from the job, in turn,
covers 100% of expenses. Thus, the professional puts time and energy into his work that pays him a wage income, which is used to pay for stuff that he subsequently consumes. Wages are typically preset to be "economic," meaning that there is no profit nor loss in it for the professional. The "profit/loss" in this setup goes to the owner of the machine that the cog fits into.</p>
    
    <p> It's obvious that the professional in this case is tightly coupled to his job. Many people's budgets are tightly coupled, since they've been encouraged to spend everything they earn. Why work if you can't spend your paycheck? After all, you deserve it. You earned it.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, many financial planners implicitly assume "expenses=income" in their calculations. Therefore, any decrease in income is felt instantly. An industrial example of a tightly coupled linear system is a manufacturing plant. If any part of the system runs slow, the entire plant runs slow and output decreases.</p>
    
    <p> The incentive is therefore to make sure that all parts are equally fast or equally slow and work together as a team.
Most consumer products are also engineered as tightly coupled linear products. For those products, it's optimal if all parts have about the same rate of failure. If one component lasts a lot longer and the product isn't designed to be repaired, that component is deemed to be overengineered and it will be replaced by a cheaper component which would create more profit.</p>
    
    <p> Thus, if a product hasn't been designed to be repaired (most consumer products), one will experience the curious phenomenon that once one part fails and is repaired, other parts will start failing soon after. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to state that many consumers' budgets work in a similar manner.
The example above demonstrates the typical cash flow of people without credit. People with access to credit can go into debt, and they usually do.</p>
