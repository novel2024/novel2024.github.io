Included on Anderson’s syllabus is, of course, “Walking,” the essay by philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau first delivered at the Concord Lyceum in 1851. “I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields,” he declared. That same year,
Thoreau expanded on the theme in his journal. “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live!” he exclaimed.</p>
    
    <p> “Methinks that the moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow.” 3 Thinking with Gesture GABRIEL HERCULE bounded onto the stage of Startupbootcamp’s 2018 Demo Day wearing a slim gray suit, white shirt, and red tie. Before he said a word, his confidence announced itself in his smooth stride and fluid gestures.
“Two years ago I was hit by a van because the driver’s eyes weren’t on the road,” he began.</p>
    
    <p> Hercule widened his eyes and held out his hands, palms up, as if to say, Can you believe it? “Fortunately, I made it out with only minor scratches, but this left me with a very real sense that something needed to be done about automotive safety—especially in the commercial vehicle sector,
where drivers face huge time pressures.” He spread his arms wide to emphasize the word “huge.” “One of the key lessons we learned”—the fingers of his right hand formed a precise pincer gesture—“in the commercial automotive sector is that the fleet manager is responsible for ensuring that every delivery”—the words were punctuated by two jabs at the air—“is made at the right place at the right time, a task that’s much easier said than done.” Fleet managers, Hercule continued, are nervous: nervous about their drivers getting lost, nervous about road accidents, nervous about packages arriving late.</p>
    
    <p>
“This is why fleet managers wish they could be in the vehicle with their drivers”—he made a downward tucking motion, emphasizing the word “in”—“to teach them better habits. And now they can.” Hercule paused for dramatic effect.
“I’d like to introduce the Atlas One, the very first head-up display that sends driving information directly to the driver through a projected hologram, with three key features to enhance driving behavior.</p>
    
    <p> All this, while keeping the driver’s eyes on the road.” Hercule’s hands were in constant motion as he got to the heart of his pitch: they framed his gaze like a camera’s viewfinder, then motioned toward himself as if information was flowing into his field of vision,
then pointed from his eyes toward the imagined road before him.
In fact, what was before him was an audience of several hundred potential customers, partners, and investors, listening carefully to every word. What these attendees likely didn’t realize is that they were being influenced at least as much by Hercule’s gestures as by his speech.</p>
    
    <p> Researchers who study embodied cognition are drawing new attention to the fact that people formulate and convey their thoughts not only with words but also with the motions of the hands and the rest of the body. Gestures don’t merely echo or amplify spoken language; they carry out cognitive and communicative functions that language can’t touch.
Where language is discrete and linear—one word following another—gesture is impressionistic and holistic, conveying an immediate sense of how things look and feel and move.
The special strengths of gesture are especially valuable in the effort to persuade or enlist others.</p>
    
    <p> Such movements visually place the gesturer at the center of the action, situating him at the locus of agency and control. When he talks, his words may describe or extol or explain—but when he gestures, he acts on the world (if only symbolically). At the same time, the gesturer’s motions render an abstract idea in human-scale, embodied terms, an act of translation that makes it easier for onlookers to mentally simulate the gesturer’s point of view for themselves. Perhaps most important, gesture generates the sense that an as yet immaterial enterprise is a palpable reality in the present moment.</p>
    
    <p> Using gesture in this way can confer an enormous advantage in the start-up world, one group of researchers notes, since “entrepreneurs are operating on the boundary of what is real and what is yet to happen.” That’s true for many of us, whether we’re offering projections for the next quarter, presenting a proposal for a project, or explaining why a change we’d like to make would be well advised.
Gesture brings an uncertain future into the observable present, imbues it with a realness that we can almost touch.
Jean Clarke, a professor of entrepreneurship and organization at Emlyon Business School in France, has spent years watching entrepreneurs like Gabriel Hercule make their case at demo days, incubators, and investment forums across Europe.</p>
