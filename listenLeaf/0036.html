    <p> Lies are often the first sign of manipulative behavior. If you are able to identify this recurring pattern in your relationship or interaction, then you know you have yourself a situation on your hands. How you decide to handle this situation will mean the difference between freeing yourself from the jaws and drama of a manipulator or staying on for the most overwhelming ride of your life.
Whenever possible, let the psychopath win but not at your expense.</p>
    
    <p> The personalities that love to win are often aggressive and will go to great lengths to ensure that they trump all their competitors. If you ever find yourself facing a psychopath on a negotiation table, always go for the suggestion that guarantees a win for the both of you. This is an effective means of ensuring that you do not expend all your energy trying to fight off a psychopath who is trying to finish you.
When dealing with people, be they saints or sinners, always listen to what your gut has to say.</p>
    
    <p> Scientists who have tried to explain gut instinct say that it is the body’s reaction to an intraspecies predator. This makes a whole lot of sense when you consider how sometimes you’ll feel uneasy around someone you do not know only to later find out that that person was not a good person. Do not let your gut instinct go ignored when it is working so hard to prevent you from making a mistake. In many instances, psychopaths assume roles such as mentor, boss, supervisor, church leader, guardian, or even parent.</p>
    
    <p> While these roles are indeed noble, your gut feeling might be screaming that the church leader is not as trustworthy as he might want to make you believe. If this is the case, always give priority to the gut feeling.
What your gut says is always a better bet than what you think you know.
Do not allow yourself to get drawn into the games that psychopaths,
sociopaths, narcissists, and other dark personalities play.</p>
    
    <p> Sure, you’ve read this book and are feeling particularly confident about your knowledge on the dark triad personalities. At the back of your mind, you believe that you have what it takes to take on a psychopath and win. What you do not know is that while you have just read this book, a psychopath has had his whole life to practice on his victims. Do not be drawn into their manipulations.</p>
    
    <p> It is not your job to entertain the psychopath. Your number one job when dealing with a psychopath is to protect yourself against their tricks.
 Chapter 7: Myths and Misconceptions about Dark Psychology There are numerous topics which are safe for dinner conversation. Dark psychology is not one of them.</p>
    
    <p> The last thing you want to ask during Thanksgiving is how Uncle Joe scores as far as their Machiavellianism orientation is concerned. Because of the malevolence surrounding dark psychology, there are usually very few open discussions regarding the topic.
 Let’s take the dark triad test, for instance. Are you planning to take it? If yes,
do you plan to share your results with anyone? The high chances are that if you answered yes to the first question, you are probably going to answer no to the second one.</p>
    
    <p> Most human beings like to think of themselves as good people. What’s more, they like other people to think of them as good people.
Putting your dark triad test on display for everyone to see might not exactly serve this purpose. Because of all of this hush-hush surrounding dark psychology, there is, therefore, a whole lot of misconceptions and myths about the personality traits that are key vessels for dark psychology.</p>
