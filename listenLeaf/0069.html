    <p> In that sense, tips are like a collection of pretty postcards or pictures of specific instances of a particular way of living. They are interesting to look at, but they do not substitute for a map of the lifestyle, nor do they substitute for navigating the map, and most importantly, knowing them does not make anyone an expert.
This is why lists and tips in any field, while greatly entertaining, often fail to deliver the desired results. Conversely, once the underlying principle has been identified, the approach becomes intuitive and automatic, thus obviating the need to follow lists and mechanical methods like budgets or diets.</p>
    
    <p>
The principle is to define a need or want and then proceed to fulfill that need or want with an appropriate response (see Appropriate response). An appropriate response to a problem is a solution that uses just enough resources to solve the problem--no more, no less. Since appropriate responses are rarely available in the marketplace, taking existing solutions and modifying them for things they were not intended for is a useful tactic to create more appropriate solutions.
Identifying needs and wants Spend much time reading about budgets or engaging in discussions about lifestyles and you'll notice that most of them focus on the difference between needs and wants.</p>
    
    <p> This often results in normative discussions of what other people should need or want, which usually degenerate into discussions about what is possible and what is not possible.
The fact that it is so hard to agree on which is which suggests that the differentiation has become meaningless and thus irrelevant.
There are no such things as needs and wants.
It's therefore pointless to argue about the difference or make lists of needs and wants.</p>
    
    <p> The problem is that needs and wants don't fit on two different lists. They fit on one list where they're ranked according to value rather than price (see Economical). Needs and wants are different in degree,
not in kind.
Consider, for example, shelter.</p>
    
    <p> Here the list of choices may look like this:
1. Sleeping under open air.
2. Sleeping under a tarp, basha, or hootchie.</p>
    
    <p>
3. Living in a tent.
4. Couch surfing.</p>
    
    <p>
5. Living in a shack or a cabin.
6. Living in a ship cabin or truck cab.</p>
    
    <p>
7. Living in a car or a boat.
8. Living in an RV.</p>
