    <p> The human animal is similarly delighted by the sight of gentle curves, like those that characterize the building Frank Gehry designed to house the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. When the eminent architect Philip Johnson first saw it, he was so moved that he began to weep.
Though its insights are suggestive, neuroarchitecture is far from a mature discipline. For now, when building and designing we still need to rely on our stock of conventional forms—and from these we must choose carefully,
knowing how profoundly setting can shape the way we think and act.</p>
    
    <p> We’ve seen how fully the coffeehouse model has come to dominate our notion of how workplaces should be arranged, for example. It is quintessentially modern in its rejection of bounded spaces and closed social circles, its embrace of transparency and openness—but it bears both the advantages and the drawbacks of this stance. The appeal of such places, so suited to our current sensibilities,
can blind us to the virtues of other models—premodern forms, such as the monastery and the studiolo, that served their inhabitants well before the coffeehouse was even invented.
But perhaps more concerning than spaces that affect our thinking in problematic ways are spaces that decline to shape us at all.</p>
    
    <p> Richard Coyne, a professor of architectural computing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland,
has lamented the “cognitive deficiency of non-places,” those spaces—all too common in the modern world—that are empty of cues or associations. Recall the major finding from Roger Barker’s “Midwest Study”: physical places influence our thinking and behavior far more than personality or other factors. This is possible because places offer our minds so much to work with—a “rich layering of custom, history, and meaning,” as Coyne writes. He continues: “A sign saying ‘wait here’ would be superfluous in the vestibule of the cathedral or temple, as the appropriate behavior or action is already inscribed in the architecture and ritual practices of the place.</p>
    
    <p> Neither would we require a text saying ‘Think of God,’ or ‘Consider your finitude’ in such places. In fact it could be said that we are already caught up in such thought by virtue of being in the sacred place.” But such rich signification is missing from non-places. What meaning or message is inscribed on a featureless chain store, or a generic hotel lobby, or the bleak urban “plaza” that surrounds many a skyscraper? What thoughts are inspired, what emotions are stirred by a row of beige cubicles, or a classroom housed inside a windowless trailer? We are set adrift in such spaces, alienated and purposeless.</p>
    
    <p>
This is not simply a question of aesthetics; it is a question of what we think, how we act, who we are.
Not surprisingly, Louis Kahn was one who understood the transformative effect places could have on the human psyche. Kahn, deeply versed as he was in the history of architecture, once reflected on the felt impact of the soaring design of public baths in ancient Rome. “If you look at the Baths of Caracalla,” said Kahn, “we all know that we can bathe just as well under an eight-foot ceiling as we can under a 150-foot ceiling.</p>
    
    <p>” But, he went on, “there’s something about a 150-foot ceiling that makes a man a different kind of man.” 6 Thinking with the Space of Ideas BEN PRIDMORE IS FAMOUS for his astonishingly accurate memory. A three-time winner of the World Memory Championship, Pridmore has pulled off feats such as reciting without error almost a hundred historic dates after just five minutes’ study, correctly recalling the order of more than 1,400 randomly shuffled playing cards, and committing to memory the digits of pi to thousands of decimal places. He was prominently featured in the best-selling Moonwalking with Einstein, a 2011 book by journalist Joshua Foer detailing the triumphs of memory prodigies.</p>
    
    <p>
Yet Pridmore, a resident of the town of Redditch in the United Kingdom,
can’t be counted on to remember his “lucky hat”—a black fedora that brought him good fortune at memory competitions, until he left it behind on a train.
Pridmore sometimes forgets to bring his briefcase or important papers to his job as an accountant, and he admits that he is hopeless at remembering friends’ birthdays. “I am famously bad at being able to remember people’s names and faces,” he concedes. He became a celebrated memory champion only through the application of what is known as the “method of loci”: a mental strategy that draws on the powerful connection to place that all humans share.</p>
    
    <p>
The method of loci is a venerable technique, invented by the ancient Greeks and used by educators and orators over many centuries. It works by associating each item to be remembered with a particular spot found in a familiar place, such as one’s childhood home or current neighborhood. For Ben Pridmore, this place is Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, which he attended as a child growing up in Horncastle, England. Preparing to recall the sequence of, say, a randomly shuffled deck of cards, he imagines placing each card, in order, in a succession of physical locations he would pass by if strolling through his old school:
through the front door, down the corridor, past the sixth-form common room,
into the classroom where math was taught.</p>
