At the center of it all is a metaphor: the brain as muscle. The mind, in this analogy, is akin to a biceps or a quadriceps—a physical entity that varies in strength among individuals. The comparison has been incorporated into another hugely popular concept originating in academic psychology: “grit.” Angela Duckworth, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist who defines grit as “perseverance and passion for long-term goals,” echoes Dweck in her own book.</p>
    
    <p>
“Like a muscle that gets stronger with use, the brain changes itself when you struggle to master a new challenge,” she wrote in the best-selling Grit, published in 2016. The emphasis in Grit on mustering more of one’s own internal resources makes the brain-as-muscle analogy a perfect fit. The comparison is made even more explicitly by purveyors of so-called “cognitive fitness” exercises, which have drawn millions of hopeful users under names like “CogniFit” and “Brain Gym.” (So pervasive is the metaphor that some scientists concerned about the spread of “neuromyths”—common misconceptions about the brain—have begun to point out that the brain is not actually a muscle but rather an organ made up of specialized cells known as neurons.</p>
    
    <p>) These two metaphors—brain as computer and brain as muscle—share some key assumptions. To wit: the mind is a discrete thing that is sealed in the skull;
this discrete thing determines how well people are able to think; this thing has stable properties that can easily be measured, compared, and ranked. Such assumptions feel comfortably familiar; indeed, they weren’t particularly novel even at the moment they were first proposed. For centuries, brains had been likened to machines—to whichever appliance of the time appeared most advanced: a hydraulic pump, a mechanical clock, a steam engine, a telegraph machine.</p>
    
    <p>
In a lecture delivered in 1984, philosopher John Searle noted: “Because we do not understand the brain very well, we are constantly tempted to use the latest technology as a model for trying to understand it. In my childhood we were always assured that the brain was a telephone switchboard.” Teachers, parents,
and other adults all proffered the metaphor of brain as switchboard, recounted Searle, for “what else could it be?” Brains had also long been likened to muscles that could be strengthened with exercise—a theme promulgated, for example, by physicians and health experts in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In his First Book in Physiology and Hygiene, published in 1888, doctor John Harvey Kellogg made an argument that sounds very much like Carol Dweck’s.</p>
    
    <p> “What do we do when we want to strengthen our muscles? We make them work hard every day, do we not?” Kellogg inquired of his intended youthful readership. “The exercise makes them grow large and strong. It is just the same with our brains. If we study hard and learn our lessons well, then our brains grow strong and study becomes easy.</p>
    
    <p>” Entrenched historical foundations support these metaphors; they rest upon deep cultural underpinnings as well. The computer and muscle analogies fit neatly with our society’s emphasis on individualism—its insistence that we operate as autonomous, self-contained beings, in possession of capacities and competencies that are ours alone. These comparisons also readily conform to our culture’s penchant for thinking in terms of good, better, best. Scientist and author Stephen Jay Gould once included in his list of “the oldest issues and errors of our philosophical traditions” our persistent inclination “to order items by ranking them in a linear series of increasing worth.</p>
    
    <p>” Computers may be slow or fast, muscles may be weak or strong—and so it goes, we assume, with our own and others’ minds.
There even appear to be hard-wired psychological factors underlying our embrace of these ideas about the brain. The belief that some core quantity of intelligence resides within each of our heads fits with a pattern of thought,
apparently universal in humans, that psychologists call “essentialism”—that is,
the conviction that each entity we encounter possesses an inner essence that makes it what it is. “Essentialism shows up in every society that has been studied,” notes Yale University psychology professor Paul Bloom.</p>
    
    <p> “It appears to be a basic component of how we think about the world.” We think in terms of enduring essences—rather than shifting responses to external influences— because we find such essences easier to process mentally, as well as more satisfying emotionally. From the essentialist perspective, people simply “are” intelligent or they are not.
Together, the historical, cultural, and psychological bases of our assumptions about the mind—that its properties are individual, inherent, and readily ranked according to quality—give them a powerful punch.</p>
