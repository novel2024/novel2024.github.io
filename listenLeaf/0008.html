    <p>" You can enjoy the fun of beating the system that exists to take your money and live a middle-class lifestyle on a quarter of the usual numbers. But why aim low? Why not live an upper-class lifestyle and think of yourself as a poor aristocrat? It requires a somewhat different approach, though, and it requires some skill. It also requires a reprogramming of "the way we've always done it," or, rather, the way we usually do it. In fact, a frequent question I get when I talk about frugality is what kind of things, like CFLs or pressure cookers people should buy to become more frugal.</p>
    
    <p> Wrong question, dude!
Leaving the cave takes some effort. It would be easy if the framework or mental modes of thinking outside the cave were similar to the shadows.
In that case, I'd write a list of 25 ways to save money, 25 ways to earn money, and 25 ways to save time, and you'd just add them to your checklist and squeeze them in during your lunch hour. It's acceptable to use these lists as inspirations, but don't follow them like recipes.</p>
    
    <p> You'd be missing the point. To paraphrase Einstein, you can't solve your problems with the same mindset that created them. To live as a free person, following lists of easy,
repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it's necessary to understand how the world works and how people have been specialized to the point of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature.</p>
    
    <p> To live well, one must go beyond lists and start thinking creatively about solving problems. One must accept a lot more personal responsibility than merely showing up on time, following orders, checking off boxes, and trying to fit in. One must learn the general systemic rules that allow one to improvise and really live life the way it was intended--in your own way, rather than following checklists devised by some random guy,
like me. One must start thinking creatively about how to solve problems.</p>
    
    <p>
Most of life's challenges can be thought of as problems with solutions.
Some problems are self-created; one must learn to avoid these. A common solution to problems is to go and buy some product. Too weak to open a lid? Go buy a tool rather than exercise to become stronger.</p>
    
    <p> Want to barbecue, but don't have a grill? Go buy one instead of making a fire pit.
Perhaps the best advice to overcoming this consumerist tendency to "buy, buy, buy!" is to study alternative sources of information. Ignore most of the personal finance books out there. They only explain how to play the game by the rules.</p>
    
    <p> Instead, use the rules to play a different game.
Remember that the shadows on the wall are just a part of life. There's no reason to only follow the rules of the shadows. I have been inspired by many different sources: books on backpacking, observations of animals and ecosystems, boating, cycling, people living in cars--even the homeless.</p>
    
    <p> I have read books on systems theory, biology, physics, finance, as well as more practical manuals on plumbing, house wiring, construction, etc., and then I have adapted these ideas to my own life.
To successfully break free of one's chains, one must build an overarching philosophy of what it means to live, which is different from the consumer philosophy of "follow advice/orders; work; get paycheck; spend paycheck; get stuff; repeat." Those who merely try to implement small changes like "25 Frugal Tips To Save Money" to have more money to spend have actions that are entirely misaligned with their goals, and they will fail for exactly the same reasons that most diets fail.</p>
