    <p> That is, some people are born with a predisposition to the dark triad traits. However, narcissism and psychopathy rank higher than Machiavellianism as far as heritability is concerned. That is, a psychopath parent is more likely to transfer the trait to their offspring when compared to a parent who ranks highly on the Machiavellianism scale.
In news that may not be very pleasant to anyone who is employed, the dark triadic traits have been shown to be well-represented in upper-level management.</p>
    
    <p> During the unpacking of the components of the dark triad in the sections below, it will become apparent why this representation may be so. After all, very few CEOs, if any, got to where they are by playing nice.
Unpacking the Dark Triad: Narcissism In Greek mythology, a story is told of a young man called Narcissus.
Narcissus was a hunter who was well-known for his striking good looks.</p>
    
    <p>
Despite the adoration he received from his admirers, Narcissus did not have the time of day for them and even pushed some to take their own lives in order to prove their love. While there are different versions of Narcissus’ story, all of them point to him being incredibly self-absorbed, which ultimately ended in him dying a death that was a punishment for his selfish way. Thanks to this young man’s story, the term narcissism was first coined by Sigmund Freud. Freud, in his famous 1914 essay aptly titled On Narcissism.</p>

In the simplest terms, narcissism is the excessive and obsessive self- admiration that a person has towards themselves and their physical appearance. A narcissist is often easy to spot because their actions and beliefs easily give them away. Wondering whether you have a narcissist in your life? Here’s what to look out for:
Narcissists like to feel superior and are often entitled Normal, healthy relationships involve a reasonable amount of give and take,
be they work, personal or business relationships. Narcissists do not subscribe to this logic.</p>
    
    <p> They like to do all the taking while someone else does all the giving. They feel that they are owed the things that they demand, even when this is not the case. Narcissist are unrelenting in their pursuit to be always right and always at the center of attention. At the workplace, a narcissist will never take responsibility for anything that goes wrong in a team.</p>
    
    <p> Whenever an issue arises, the narcissist will deflect blame from themselves and place it on another party. After all, they believe themselves to be superior and incapable of wrongdoing. If you are dating a narcissist, they will try and make it all about themselves. You must eat where they want, do the things they want and place your life on hold to make them happy.</p>
    
    <p> They will have no problem doing all these things that normal people would frown upon because in their minds they are actually doing you a favor by dating you. If you come across these signs of extreme self-centeredness in an individual, you are likely to be dealing with a narcissist.
Narcissists are often type A perfectionists For many people, flaws and imperfections are a normal part of life. If a party does not go exactly according to plan, most people have no problem kicking back and enjoying it all the same.</p>
    
    <p> Not so for narcissists. For a narcissist, if something is not perfect, then it does not count. Narcissists seek perfection in everything that they do because they believe they are perfect and therefore, deserving of only perfection. If you are dating a narcissist, they will demand perfection from you as far as how you dress,
the way you talk, the kind of friends you keep, the neighborhood you live in and just about anything.</p>
