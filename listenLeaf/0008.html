    <p> While the Hazda people of East Africa —one of the hunter-gatherer tribes studied by Raichlen—spend an average of 135 minutes a day engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity, most inhabitants of industrialized countries fail to meet health experts’ minimum recommendation of 150 minutes of activity a week. Put another way,
contemporary hunter-gatherers engage in more than fourteen times as much moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as the typical American. The lack of physical movement in our society is due in large part to the dominance of academic learning and of knowledge work, and to the habits and convictions that have grown up around these endeavors. While we’re thinking, we believe, we should be sitting still.</p>
    
    <p>
Challenges to this belief may be met with derision. When Jeff Fidler published his findings in the Journal of the American College of Radiology,
some of his colleagues reacted with mocking ridicule. “I see that I can depend on this publication for comic relief,” wrote Robert Feld, a radiologist from Hartford,
Connecticut, in a letter to the editor. Fidler’s study, he declared, was “a parody of clinical research gone awry”; in Feld’s view, making provisions for physicians to move as they work is “a staggering waste of effort and resources.</p>
    
    <p>” Such attitudes are widely reflected in the way students and workers use their time. Children spend an average of 50 percent of the school day sitting, a proportion that increases as they enter adolescence. Adults in the workplace move even less, remaining seated for more than two-thirds of the average workday. We inherited a “mind on the hoof,” in the phrase of philosopher Andy Clark—but in today’s classrooms and offices, the vigorous clatter of hoofs has come to an eerie halt.</p>
    
    <p>
 THAT’S EMPHATICALLY not the case in the classroom helmed by Maureen Zink, a fourth-grade teacher at Vallecito Elementary School in San Rafael, California.
Her students don’t sit still at their desks; in fact, most of them are not sitting at all. In 2013, the entire school replaced traditional desks and chairs with standing desks, and the school’s “activity-permissive” ethos allows pupils to stand upright, perch on stools, sit on the floor, and otherwise move around as they wish. Though some were hesitant about the change, Zink and the other teachers at Vallecito now say it’s been a resounding success; students are more alert,
more attentive, and more engaged.</p>
    
    <p> “I taught at sitting desks for 30 years,” says Zink, “and I’ll never go back.” Tracy Smith, the principal at Vallecito during the switch to standing desks, agrees that students are “more focused, confident, and productive” when given license to move.
The community’s initial trepidation is telling. We associate stillness with steadiness, seriousness, and industriousness; we believe there’s something virtuous about controlling the impulse to move.</p>
    
    <p> At times and places where there’s work to be done, physical movement is regarded with disapproval, even suspicion. (Consider the way we associate fidgeting with a certain moral shiftiness.) What this attitude overlooks is that the capacity to regulate our attention and our behavior is a limited resource, and some of it is used up by suppressing the very natural urge to move.
This trade-off is highlighted by the work of Christine Langhanns and Hermann Müller of Justus Liebig University in Germany.</p>
    
    <p> For a study published in 2018, they asked groups of volunteers to solve a set of math problems in their heads while staying still, while remaining relaxed “but without substantial movement,” or while moving slightly in a rhythmic pattern. All the while, the participants’ cognitive load—how hard their brains were working—was being measured with a brain-scanning technology called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results were illuminating. Subjects’ cognitive load “considerably increased under the instruction ‘not to move,’ ” Langhanns and Müller report.</p>
    
    <p> Significantly, the stay-still command increased brain activity in the same area as did the mental calculations: the prefrontal cortex, responsible for carrying out intellectual tasks like arithmetic and for keeping our impulses in check. Of the three conditions, the requirement to remain still produced the poorest performance on the math problems; the greater their overall cognitive load as registered by fNIRS, the worse the subjects did on the calculations.
“Sitting quietly,” the researchers conclude, “is not necessarily the best condition for learning in school.” The continual small movements we make when standing as opposed to sitting —shifting our weight from one leg to another, allowing our arms to move more freely—constitute what researchers call “low-intensity” activity.</p>
    
    <p> As slight as these movements appear, they have a marked effect on our physiology: an experiment carried out by researchers at the Mayo Clinic determined that simply by standing rather than sitting, study participants expended 13 percent more energy. The impact on our cognitive functioning is also significant. Research has found that the use of a standing desk is associated with an enhancement in students’ executive function—that crucial capacity for planning and decision making—and with an increase in “on-task engagement.” In adults, working at a standing desk has been shown to boost productivity.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s not only that such activity-permissive setups relieve us of the duty to monitor and control our inclination to move; they also allow us to fine-tune our level of physiological arousal. Such variable stimulation may be especially important for young people with attention deficit disorders. The brains of kids with ADHD appear to be chronically under-aroused; in order to muster the mental resources needed to tackle a difficult assignment, they may tap their fingers, jiggle their legs, or bounce in their seats. They move as a means of increasing their arousal—not unlike the way adults down a cup of coffee in order feel more alert.</p>
