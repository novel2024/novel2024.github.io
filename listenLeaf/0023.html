On any other day, they would have sat back and considered the work involved in making lasagna and probably suggested an alternative. On the day that you throw them off your pattern, they will say yes without thinking too much because you have essentially short-circuited their conscious mind.
Tip #2: Make use of the Zeigarnik effect In psychology, the Zeigarnik effect is the concept that people are more likely to remember incomplete tasks than those which have been completed.
Think about it: if you intend to do your laundry, you are likely to have this thought lingering in your mind until you actually wash all your dirty clothes and put them away.</p>
    
    <p> Soon after completing your laundry duties, you will no longer have any interest in remembering anything to do with laundry. The Zeigarnik effect was named so after a Russian psychologist who investigated the phenomenon after being inspired by her professor. The professor, one Kurt Lewin, made the observation that a waiter was able to remember more accurately the orders that were still unpaid.
In everyday life, the Zeigarnik effect is used in many scenarios.</p>
    
    <p> Soap operas and television series, in particular, are keen to leave their audience wanting more by ensuring that each episode ends with a cliffhanger. When the episode ends anticlimactically, your brain stores this in your short-term memory as an incomplete task. This is why you keep going back to your favorite soap opera because your mind tells you to finish what you started.
As long as the incompleteness is lingering somewhere in your brain, your attention will be drawn there.</p>
    
    <p>
To hypnotize someone using the Zeigarnik effect, consider telling an exciting story complete with pauses in between during which you give them hypnotic commands. This might look something like this:
You will not believe what happened last weekend when I decided to go hiking with my friends. We were walking up this rather lonely trail when all of a sudden we [could you please shut the door for me] hear these strange noises coming from the woods. They sounded like a cross between a coyote and a bear, and they were getting louder and louder the further we got up the trail.</p>
    
    <p> At this point, of course, we are getting very concerned but [could you also file these documents for me] we knew that there was no turning back. We were four of us, and we were prepared to fight whatever it was… During this storytelling, you can ask your conversation partner to do pretty much anything that you want without much objection. This is because their mind is focused on the story that you are telling, and their brain is yearning for the completion. While they are in this trance-like state, they are your putty to work with.</p>
    
    <p>
Tip #3: Stay ambiguous Ambiguity keeps your audience guessing. If you want to linger in the minds of people you interact with long after the conversation has ended, you must strike a balance between being memorable and staying ambiguous.
Ambiguity keeps the mind wondering: what exactly did he mean when he said this or that? As long as their mind is wondering, you are in control of the other person. Ambiguity and vagueness confuse the conscious mind.</p>
    
    <p>
There are things that cannot be processed by the conscious mind, and the mystery of ambiguity is one of them.
In the world of dating and relationships, ambiguity can serve a particularly important role in convincing others to go out with or date you. Many relationship experts will concur that a little mystery serves a long way as far as keeping things exciting. What most is not explain is why.</p>
    
    <p> The reason why mystery is so exciting is that as long as you have not been fully processed and understood by a person’s conscious mind, you will always linger in their mind. You can hypnotize your partner or lover into doing whatever you want them to do by always ensuring that you are ambiguous and mysterious about one or two things.
Tip #4: Negative words have more impact It is often believed that the subconscious mind cannot hear negatives.
Instead, any negatives communicated to the subconscious mind are interpreted as positives.</p>
