    <p> These are the people who build the "cookie-cutter homes" of their professions, which are ideally suited for mass production. These are the "professionals." Creating a system based on specialized production thus increases productivity, but at the cost of increased risk to and pressure on the individual. Another feature of specialized work is that it depends on expending resources such as time and energy.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore, specialization is not an optimal strategy for those who seek balance in their life. Those who take some time or energy off to pursue other interests will surely be overtaken by another specialist, who sleeps less or does not have other responsibilities. The competition is intense.
A further problem that causes systemic inefficiencies is that advancement inside the system is subject to the Peter Principle, where people are promoted as long as they're competent in their current specialization.</p>
    
    <p> This creates a problem as specializations change, and a person might get promoted to a specialization, typically management,
where he isn't competent (his highest level of incompetence) and never will be. In such a system, work is only done by those who are yet to reach a position in which they're incompetent. Although some institutions have made efforts to eliminate the detrimental effects of this principle, it's still observed in many places.
Job competition As mentioned above, specialization has another problem.</p>
    
    <p> Competition is very difficult because it's hard to compare the actual skills of the specialists. In some cases, the desired skill level for a position is reached by several competitors, who are all sufficiently good. If there are plenty of competitors, the decision process breaks down, becomes fuzzy, and starts depending on things that are less connected with the skills in demand. In those cases, getting the job begins to depend on intangibles which are generally outside the control, and certainly outside the specialization, of the worker.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, there are plenty other specialists who will sell advice on what to wear, how to format a résumé, which clubs to join, etc. This is good for the system, but less beneficial for the individual.
Large amounts of time are spent picking the few winners of this game.
One might argue that the function of a college education isn't so much to provide education as it is to produce college dropouts, who are willing to accept lower paying jobs.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, a college education is a sorting mechanism. It does not stop there, though. A so-called career provides a similar sorting mechanism. People frequently talk about climbing the corporate ladder.</p>
    
    <p> However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough,
one eventually will get to the top. In reality, it's more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard; one also has to beat the other climbers as the pyramid gets narrower and narrower.
While this system tends to promote those with the required skills to best play the game, it causes much stress and wasted effort.</p>
    
    <p> Since so many are used to thinking that employment-based income is the only way to get ahead, they spend all their effort on their job to the detriment of their home life, despite employers paying lip service to work-life balance. Here, one solution is to moderate one's career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only depends on skills, but also requires 100% dedication, reading time, and possibly some ethical compromises, one can aid in the sorting process by consciously seeking positions suitable to one's more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition. Those with less foresight are forced to lower their aims through career burn out.</p>
