    <p> For instance, if all cars were sold with a locked steering wheel, cars could only go forward or backward. Soon this restricted behavior would become normal. Roads would be designed to make driving without turning the wheels easier. The purpose of the steering wheel would be forgotten.</p>
    
    <p> First it would be turned into a clothes hanger,
like much home exercise equipment. In later models it might be eliminated altogether.
A society that worships conformity has zero apparent degrees of freedom. This may be hard to understand in a consumer society which prides itself on choice.</p>
    
    <p> However, while the choices are abundant, they're restricted to a fairly narrow range. Consider shaving kits for men. These are restricted to various multi-bladed safety razors, in which a below-cost handle locks the consumer into a product line, after which more expensive replacement blades can be sold to recover the cost. It's getting increasingly hard to find the old flat single safety razor blades that can be sharpened.</p>
    
    <p> A straight razor can only be bought from barbershops, hairdressers, or specialized shops on the Internet. Not shaving at all is sure to make a person stand out. Thus, this is an example where the degrees of freedom for the consumer have been eliminated. It also shows the possibility of finding other solutions.</p>
    
    <p>
In democratic societies with a free market, and certain other societies as well, the economic possibilities of a member of society can be described with at least two degrees of freedom, as shown in this figure. One axis describes the linearity of the person's activities, while the other axis describes the coupling between the person and the activities, typically through an economic system.
Domain of economic behaviors described in terms of coupling and organizational structure. This divides the domain into four types.</p>
    
    <p>
Coupling is a measure of a person's dependence on the world, economic here. In principle, it also measures the world's dependence on the individual. However, except for billionaires, leaders of totalitarian countries, and rock stars, it's doubtful how much impact individual people have on the world.
A tight coupling means that one part depends strongly on another part of the system.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, the front wheels of a car are tightly coupled to the steering wheel, which is good. When the steering wheel turns, the front wheels turn as well. For a consumer, food, shelter, etc.Â are tightly coupled to a paycheck, which is not good.</p>
    
    <p> Much effort in engineering goes into establishing tight couplings between some parts--for example, the steering system mentioned above--and removing couplings between other parts--for example, not having the steering system coupled to the engine system. A tight coupling or a complete lack of coupling makes the response predictable. This is also useful in social engineering. For instance, a consumer that is fully dependent on a paycheck is more likely to stay employed and not quit his job.</p>
