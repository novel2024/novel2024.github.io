    <p> Check back frequently to see if anyone is underpricing you.
Serial ownership Many things--books in particular come to mind--are sufficiently well- built to last longer than you as their owner maintain an interest in them.
Instead of storing them, which increases the demand for housing and new goods, I feel almost obligated to reduce this pressure by passing them along when I'm no longer interested, so that other people may enjoy them. For similar reasons, I also always attempt to buy things used.</p>
    
    <p> Not only does this keep the pressure off of people's homes, it also keeps the pressure off landfills, since normal people don't think twice about throwing perfectly functional items in the trash when their space becomes too crowded by stuff. In fact, any depreciating asset should always be bought used if you must own it at all. Serial ownership is one of the biggest contributions you can make towards counteracting environmental problems (climate change,
resource depletion, and population pressure), as the resources required to build and transport stuff is generally higher than those used to repair and maintain stuff, and even the resources used to heat and light your home.
Bartering and swapping Bartering and swapping work best with what could be considered "differentiated commodities" such as CDs, books, board games, computer games, etc.</p>
    
    <p> These things are all different in degree but very similar in kind (a CD is a CD), and joining a network is a great way to get new media.
Once you develop some skill in networking and bartering, you'll begin to pay attention to the needs of other people and whether you can fulfill them with items you have. At this point you may want to barter your excess items for food or services, to reduce your stuff.
Using up and wearing out Those who take care of their stuff will likely be able to use their current inventory for several years before using it up.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, in my experience one towel will last four years if it's the only one in use.
Consequently, a set of four towels in rotation will last a good 16 years.
Similarly, if t-shirts can be washed 100 times,61 are only worn once between washings, one is worn every day, and you have 15 of them--which shouldn't be a problem if you participate in a few events that give you a free t-shirt each year--you have enough t-shirts to last four years.
Unlike cars and computers, which start failing "all over" once the first failures start to appear,62 clothes have known weak spots--for example,
armpit, shoulder, and crotch seams or heels and toes in socks.</p>
    
    <p> Learn to mend these.
You can make a sport out of extending the wear. For instance, bed sheets generally wear out in the middle (the middle part covers the body).
When it finally rips (this takes 3-4 years if you only have one set, and why own more?), you can cut it in half along the middle and sew the sides together to become the new middle.</p>
    
    <p> This is how people used to do it, but I must admit that today fabric is so cheap that I'd just get a new set and turn the old sheets into rags for cleaning. The benefit of this exercise is perhaps not so much in extending the wear of things, but in learning what to look for when acquiring new things. For instance, having noticed that the no- stick treatment for pots and pans only lasts a couple of years and that it can't, as far as I know, be replaced, get stainless steel, iron, or copper the next time. For shoes, get Norwegian welts, which allow a complete replacement of the sole.</p>
    
    <p> And try to avoid plastic; it is hard to fashion plastic replacement parts on your own.
How to get things Things used to be built to last. It was expected that a piece of furniture or even a good jacket could be handed down to the next generation. With growing product quality, there was a limit to the size of the market.</p>
    
    <p> As soon as everybody had everything they needed, there was no one left to sell to and businesses would have begun to shut down, leaving people with less work (gasp!). This happened around the 1920s. The solution was and still is to change the focus to the service aspect.63 One contemporary example is when a $500 cell phone is sold for $1, but with a mandatory $1,000 contract.</p>
