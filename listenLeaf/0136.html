    <p> I would certainly not try to fill their schedule with leadership activities and other brouhaha for their application to Brand Name University. I would make sure they did their homework, but I would let them make their own mistakes.
I don't think I would pay an allowance, but I would hire them to do work not associated with the household. Whenever they got a money gift (birthday, Xmas) or any income whatsoever, I would make them put 50% into savings and let them spend the other 50% as they wished.</p>
    
    <p> I would let them spend the interest of their savings account, hoping that they got the point. Once they understood the point of this exercise, the decision would be up to them. In the end, I would not be able to make the decision of whether they should be salary men, working men, businessmen, or Renaissance men. That would be up to them.</p>
    
    <p>
Naturally I'd also educate them on life skills that they don't get from school. They would know how to read a balance sheet, double dig a garden,
put up a shelf, and fix a flat before turning 18. Again, the decision whether to spend money on this later on would be theirs.
Speaking of school, I would concentrate on the early years (primary) rather than the late years (trade school / college).</p>
    
    <p> Generalized skills, such as work discipline and the multiplication table, learned early are far more important than a course in Ancient Egyptian Algebra, in my opinion. I would strongly encourage that they learn a trade (machinist, engineer,
accountant, nurse, etc.) before going for their education (English literature,
history, political science, mathematics, etc.).</p>
    
    <p> This would make it possible to work their way through college and always have something to fall back on.
I would probably not pay for a college education, but they would be free to stay at home until they finish. I'd recommend a state university and make them fully aware of the consequences of being in debt up to their eyeballs should they insist on a brand name college.
In conclusion, I don't believe that adding members to our household would materially change the possibility, form, and implementation of financial independence.</p>

Foundations of economics and finance An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources), producers, consumers, and decomposers. Modern economics only considers two of these relevant: producers and consumers. It ignores the finite103 abiotic resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers' ability to turn them into commodities. Similarly, consumers and producers ignore decomposition.</p>
    
    <p> Once our waste and detritus is dumped into landfills, lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind. Meanwhile, the finite planet is running out of its finite resources (duh!) and pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. Typically, the economists solve this problem by waving their hands and mumbling something about substitution and human ingenuity. However, it's obvious that our cultural paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no longer be considered infinite.</p>
    
    <p>
Naturally, the economy can't keep growing without killing itself if the cycle isn't completed. If the cycle is not completed, we're either going to run out of resources or drown in pollution. If a decision is made to solve this problem, the size of the economy would be determined by how efficient the cycle is. Given the enormous size of the human population in relation to the renewable resource base of Earth, completing this cycle and preventing leaks will be to the 21st century what the Cold War was to the 20th century.</p>
