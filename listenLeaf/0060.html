    <p>The solution is to reverse the outsourcing of ordinary life skills and gradually insource skills that were previously acquired in the marketplace to become less dependent on a single source of income.
become less dependent on a multitude of store services.
This is both simple as well as tremendously challenging, because it requires a different kind of thinking. To get started, make a list of services and things acquired in the marketplace (see Building blocks for how to get a better idea of how to look for them) and start learning them on a need-to- know basis (see The Renaissance education).</p>
    
    <p> Here is a short list41 of suggestions:
1. Hair cutting. If necessary change your hairstyle into something you can do. Be flexible!
2.</p>
    
    <p> Mending clothes and darning socks.
3. Cooking, preferably from scratch. Heating something in the microwave or mixing powder with water doesn't count.</p>
    
    <p> Again, if necessary, change your diet.
4. Buying something used instead of new or swapping something. There are now many websites to facilitate this.</p>
    
    <p>
5. Getting somewhere without a car. Use public transportation, commute by bicycle or try walking a few blocks to the grocery.
6.</p>
    
    <p> Borrowing a book from the library. It's amazing how many people do not take advantage of this free resource.
7. Planting a garden of edible vegetables.</p>
    
    <p> Start with spices. Move onto high-cost/low-effort plants like tomatoes (not potatoes). Look into permaculture and intensive gardening.
8.</p>
    
    <p> Making simple nontoxic household agents from scratch, like laundry detergent, toothpaste, insect killer, window cleaner, or beer.
9. Bicycle, motorcycle, or car maintenance. At least start by washing it yourself.</p>
