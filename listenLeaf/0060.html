    <p> This development was especially apparent in the places where we work. By the beginning of our own century, some 70 to 80 percent of American office workers labored in open-plan rooms.
Why did the wall-less workspace triumph over the private office? For one thing, it’s cheaper. Open-plan office space can cost as much as 50 percent less per employee than more traditional office layouts because of its smaller footprint and lower interior construction costs.</p>
    
    <p> But there was also a theoretical rationale behind the enthusiasm for open offices —a bold idea, if you will. The idea is this: take down the walls, throw everybody together in one big room, and communication will flow, with increased collaboration and creativity sure to follow.
The notion of promoting collisions in a shared space comes with an appealing historical and intellectual pedigree. The coffeehouse, as author Steven Johnson has told us in his influential writings on “where ideas come from,” is the arena where the modern world was born.</p>
    
    <p> These buzzy gathering places, Johnson writes, “fertilized countless Enlightenment-era innovations; everything from the science of electricity, to the insurance industry, to democracy itself.” New ideas,
he argues, arise out of “the collisions that happen when different fields of expertise converge in some shared physical or intellectual space.” For example: during the years he lived in London, from 1764 to 1775,
Benjamin Franklin spent many hours at a coffeehouse near St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>
    
    <p>
In his book The Invention of Air, Johnson recounts how Franklin mingled there with a group of “freethinkers”—scientists, mathematicians, philosophers—who stimulated and inspired one another through their wide-ranging conversations.
“There should be a plaque to commemorate that coffeehouse,” Johnson has said.
“It was really a tremendously generative space.” Today’s leaders and managers have seized on this notion: get people to “collide” with one another, the thinking goes, and magic will happen.</p>
    
    <p> How better to promote collisions than to remove the physical barriers that would keep them from happening?
And, in fact, it is the case that people who work near one another are more likely to communicate and collaborate. This finding was first demonstrated more than forty years ago by Thomas Allen, a professor at MIT who drew what has come to be known as the “Allen curve.” The curve describes a consistent relationship between physical distance and frequency of communication: the rate of people’s interactions declines exponentially with the distance between the spaces where they work. This would mean, for example, that people sitting six feet apart are four times more likely to talk regularly than people seated sixty- five feet apart.</p>
    
    <p> Allen found that fifty meters (about 165 feet) was the cutoff point for regular information exchange; beyond that distance, routine communication effectively ceased. People who are located close to one another are more likely to encounter one another, and it’s these encounters that spark informal exchanges, interdisciplinary ideas, and fruitful collaborations.
Allen further observed that shared spaces through which every member of an organization passes at least once a day are especially useful encounter promoters. He offered as an example MIT’s “Infinite Corridor,” an 825-foot- long hallway that runs through several buildings, effectively extending from one side of the campus to the other.</p>
    
    <p> (That’s longer than two football fields, although MIT students are less apt to be interested in football than in . . . other things.</p>
    
    <p>
Undergraduates at the university celebrate the moment each school year when the sun lines up in just the right spot to beam its rays directly down the long hallway. They call it MIThenge.) More recent research has confirmed Allen’s original findings; in the age of texting, email, and Slack, the Allen curve still applies. Online communication, it seems, is no substitute for the offhand conversation, the casual exchange carried out in person.</p>
