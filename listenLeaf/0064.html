This rarely works, since real-life goals are seldom straightforwardly one-dimensional. Most actions have side effects. This has a very important consequence:
You can never do just one thing!
When focusing on a single goal, side effects are ignored. For instance,
the most popular single goal is building a career.</p>
    
    <p> This goal tends to ignore the sometimes adverse side effects such as complete dependence on the job,
complete identification with the job, alienation from the spouse and any children, failing physical health, stress, and so on. If one manages to maintain a strict focus on the goal, then by the time the goal is reached, this strategy will have caused so much collateral damage that the work is not complete; the damage must be fixed first. Often this "fixing" creates additional problems.
Consider a two-dimensional problem (see this figure).</p>
    
    <p> A rudimentary example of a two-dimensional problem is achieving the famous "work- life"-balance. While I don't believe there is such a thing, it will serve as an example. In this example, the challenge is to solve two problems simultaneously. The first problem, goal1, is the "work" problem,
presumably working enough to build a career, display skills, gain power,
money, awards, merit badges, or whatever.</p>
    
    <p> The ideal point is marked on the x-axis. The second problem, goal2, is the "life" problem, that is having a happy home life, whatever that entails. The ideal point is marked on the y- axis. Together they form a two-dimensional goal (goal1,goal2) marked with the box "Goal.</p>
    
    <p>" This figure requires a rudimentary understanding of vector spaces from "linear algebra 101." It shows the difference between a heterotelic and a homeotelic response in a world that only has two possible goals. The homeotelic response moves closer to both goals whereas the heterotelic response, while moving further towards goal-1,
actually moves away from goal-2.
Also shown in the figure are two possible strategies.</p>
    
    <p> Both strategies have side effects and affect the pursuit of both goals. The heterotelic strategy moves you closer to goal-1--you went in the right direction along the x-axis--but away from goal-2--you went in the wrong direction along the y-axis. Heterotelic, a term borrowed from ecological philosophy, means different goals (telos is Greek for goal). A heterotelic strategy includes finite behavior that is misdirected.</p>
    
    <p> This behavior is behavior that works against you. The homeotelic, meaning same goals, response, on the other hand, moves you closer to both goals. From a systemic perspective, the homeotelic response is the right strategy, because it works against you the least.
Another way to think of a heterotelic response to a problem is that it aims to fix a single symptom of, say, a disease.</p>
    
    <p> If the response causes undesirable side effects, additional drugs are taken in an attempt to fix these side effects. Here many arrows are used in the figure to try to get closer to the desired goal. The heterotelic response makes particular symptoms more bearable and tends to encourage more problem-causing behavior. If hiding the symptoms is effective, then Liebig's Law of the minimum suggests that additional symptoms will appear.</p>
