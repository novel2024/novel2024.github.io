    <p> The way we act, the way we think, and even the way we perceive the world around us differ when we’re in a space that’s familiar to us—one that we have shaped through our own choices and imbued with our own memories of learning and working there in the past. When we’re on our home turf, Meagher has found, our mental and perceptual processes operate more efficiently, with less need for effortful self-control. The mind works better because it doesn’t do all the work on its own; it gets an assist from the structure embedded in its environment,
structure that marshals useful information, supports effective habits and routines,
and restrains unproductive impulses. In a familiar space over which we feel ownership, he suggests, “our cognition is distributed across the entire setting.</p>
    
    <p>” The place itself helps us think.
With ownership comes control, and a sense of control over their space—how it looks and how it functions—leads people to perform more productively. This was demonstrated in dramatic fashion in an experiment conducted by psychologists Craig Knight and Alex Haslam. In the study, volunteers were given a set of tasks to perform under one of four conditions: they worked in a lean office (spare, uncluttered); in an enriched office (decorated with posters and potted plants); in an empowered office (participants could arrange the room as they liked); and in a disempowered office (the room was rearranged in front of them, without their cooperation or consent).</p>
    
    <p>
In the lean office, found Knight and Haslam, participants invested a low level of effort in their assigned work; they were listless and lackadaisical. In the disempowered office, subjects’ productivity was similarly mediocre; in addition,
they were very, very unhappy. “I wanted to hit you,” one participant confessed to the experimenter in a follow-up interview, describing how he felt as “his” office was rearranged to the researcher’s liking. In the enriched office,
participants worked harder and were more productive; in the empowered office,
people performed best of all.</p>
    
    <p> They got 30 percent more done there than in the lean office, and about 15 percent more than in the enriched office. The size of such effects is large enough to make any employer sit up and take notice: three people working in empowered offices accomplished almost as much as four people in lean offices.
Perhaps the most important form of control over one’s space is authority over who comes in and out—a point missed by those who believe that our who comes in and out—a point missed by those who believe that our workspaces should resemble a bustling coffeehouse. The informal exchanges facilitated by proximity are indeed generative.</p>
    
    <p> But the value of such interactions can be extracted only if it is also possible, when necessary, to avoid interacting at all. Consider again in this light the denizens of the St. Paul’s coffeehouse, who surely had private studies to which to retreat at home, or the professors who traverse MIT’s Infinite Corridor—on their way to their own quiet, book-lined offices.
It’s certainly the case that the nature of today’s work demands frequent consultation and cooperation with others.</p>
    
    <p> What we may not realize is that good work also requires periods of abstention from such exchanges—a phenomenon that organizational psychologists call “intermittent collaboration.” Research on intermittent collaboration is based on the understanding that complex problem solving proceeds in two stages, the first of which entails gathering the facts we need to clarify the nature of the problem and begin constructing a solution. In this stage, communication and collaboration are essential. But there is a second phase, equally vital: the process of generating and developing solutions, and figuring out which of these solutions is best.</p>
    
    <p> During this phase, studies find,
excessive collaboration is actually detrimental.
The reason can be found in our nature as a group-dwelling species. We are exquisitely sensitive to social pressure, easily drawn into consensus and conformity. When we’re constantly in touch with others, we all end up gravitating toward the same pretty-good-but-not-great answers.</p>
    
    <p> Research finds that people who keep lines of communication perpetually open consistently generate middling solutions—nothing terrible, but nothing exceptional either.
Meanwhile, people who isolate themselves during the solution-generation phase tend to come up with a few truly extraordinary solutions—along with a lot of losers. The best of all worlds is enjoyed by those who engage in cycles of sociable interaction and quiet focus. Just as we need walls to protect us from our propensity to be distracted, so we require walls to shield us from our susceptibility to social pressure.</p>
