    <p> With so many variables,
there are several solutions.
(75) Four layers could be an undershirt, a shirt, a sweater, and a suit jacket for the top. For the legs, long underwear and tweed pants. For the feet,
double layer socks.</p>
    
    <p> Finally a scarf to round out the intellectual look.
(76) The most efficient wardrobe will typically be based on the above mentioned base colors. It can be expanded by adding a color/shade that goes well with your skin tone, eye color, hair color, etc. This step is not necessary if you're okay with a bland style.</p>
    
    <p> For bags, belts, and shoes stick with one color. Black matches everything, but brown is more casual.
(77) Perhaps being surrounded by madness redefines madness as normal,
while making depression and other health issues a natural response to an unnatural situation? In other words, is it really healthy to be adjusted to an unhealthy culture? I say no.
(78) Imagine how a health care system that focused on promoting health rather than treating diseases or symptoms would look.</p>
    
    <p> It would not be a particular institution or corporation. It would be a system which was completely integrated with everyday life to form healthy habits.
(79) If the food energy is not burned, it must be stored--think of the fuel tank as being made out of expanding nonrupturing rubber, making an overflow impossible. As food is eaten but not burned, it's stored in the tank as fat.</p>
    
    <p> Fortunately, storing more fuel makes the body spend more energy to carry it around. This is perhaps not as comfortable for the "owner" of the body, as it detracts from the handling characteristic, but it prevents the fuel tank from growing infinitely large as the increased amount of calories required to carry it around eventually matches the caloric intake.
(80) On a parallel note, The United States used to be known for its auto companies. Today, some of the biggest industrial companies are in the business of selling junk food and cholesterol-lowering drugs.</p>
    
    <p> Food for thought?
(81) Jogging means speeds between 10 minutes per mile and 15 minutes per mile. Anything faster is running. Anything slower is walking.
(82) The body which has been evolutionarily conditioned over millions of years thinks, "I'm being pursued and I don't get to eat much.</p>
    
    <p> How do I survive this? Better hang on to the energy I already have. How do I do that? First, by storing all the fat close to the muscles where it is going to be used (thighs and butt). Second, by decreasing muscle mass to its bare necessity--that is, just enough power to keep me jogging, which is nothing more than a controlled continuous fall forward, and by becoming a more efficient runner to use less energy." (83) Compare Anakin Skywalker to Luke Skywalker.</p>

(84) In itself, the biceps are fairly useless muscles which mainly act as support to hold the elbow joint together when pulling a heavy load. In the past, a large bicep thus suggested that the functional muscles of the back and torso, which aren't immediately apparent when seen from the front, were really strong. Similarly, the pectorals, which are visible from the front, aren't as useful as the triceps and shoulders are for pushing. Large pectorals thus suggested very strong triceps and shoulders.</p>
