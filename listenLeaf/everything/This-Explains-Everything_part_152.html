He conceived this novel idea by listening with a critical‚Äîand open‚Äîmind to his patients with depression. In his early work on depression, Beck set out to test a specific psychoanalytic idea: that depression was due to ‚Äúintrojected anger.‚Äù Patients with depression, it was argued, experienced deep hostility and anger toward someone they loved. They could not deal with having hostile feelings toward someone they valued, so they would repress their anger and direct it inward, toward themselves. Beck tested this idea by comparing the dreams‚Äîthe royal road to the unconscious‚Äîof depressed patients with those of non-depressed patients and found that in their dreams depressed patients showed, if anything, less hostility than non-depressed patients. Instead, in their dreams, as in their waking lives, depressed patients have a systematic negative bias in their cognitive style, in the way they think about themselves and their future. They see themselves as ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù</p><p>Beck considered these distorted patterns of thinking not simply a symptom‚Äîa reflection of a conflict lying deep within the psyche‚Äîbut a key etiological agent in maintaining the disorders. This led him to develop a systematic psychological treatment for depression that focused on distorted thinking. He found that increasing the patients‚Äô objectivity regarding their misinterpretation of situations, or their cognitive distortions and negative expectations, resulted in substantial shifts in their thinking and subsequent improvements in their affect and behavior.</p><p>During his work on depression, Beck focused on suicide and provided for the first time a rational basis for the classification and assessment of suicidal behaviors, making it possible to identify high-risk individuals. His prospective study of 9,000 patients led to the formulation of an algorithm for predicting future suicide that has proved to have high predictive power. Of particular importance was his identification of clinical and psychological variables such as hopelessness and helplessness to predict future suicides. These turned out to be better predictors of suicide than clinical depression per se. Beck‚Äôs work on suicide‚Äîand that of others, such as John Mann at Columbia‚Äîdemonstrated that a short-term cognitive intervention can significantly reduce subsequent suicide attempts.</p><p>In the 1970s, Beck carried out the aforementioned controlled trials. Later, the National Institute of Mental Health carried out similar trials, and together these established cognitive therapy as the first psychological treatment shown to be effective in clinical depression.</p><p>As soon as cognitive therapy was found effective in the treatment of depression, Beck turned to other disorders. In a number of controlled clinical trials, he demonstrated that cognitive therapy is effective in panic disorder, post-traumatic-stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In fact, even before Helen Mayberg‚Äôs work on depression, Lewis Baxter at UCLA had imaged patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and found an abnormality in the caudate nucleus that was reversed when they improved with cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p>Aaron Beck has recently turned his attention to patients with schizophrenia and has found that cognitive therapy helps improve their cognitive and negative symptoms, particularly their motivational deficits. Another amazing advance.</p><p>So the answer to the decline of psychoanalysis may not simply lie in the limitation of Freud‚Äôs thought but much more in the lack of a deep, critical, scientific attitude of many in the subsequent generation of therapists. I have little doubt that insight therapy is extremely useful as a therapy, and there are studies supporting that contention. But an elegant, deep, and beautiful proof requires putting a set of highly validated approaches together to make the point in a convincing manner and perhaps even providing us with an idea of how the therapeutic result is achieved.</p><p>TRANSITIONAL OBJECTS</p><p>SHERRY TURKLE</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_151.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_153.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
