Answers to his questions often reflect a current zeitgeist in the scientific community, but those answers mutate as additional knowledge becomes available. His questions challenge us to rethink our basic presumptions each time another chunk of data lands in our laps, whatever our field of study. Our fascination with simple elegant answers strikes me as a Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy) pursuit: We may find ‚Äú42,‚Äù but unless we know how to formulate the appropriate questions, the answer isn‚Äôt always very meaningful.</p><p>THE UNIVERSAL TURING MACHINE</p><p>GLORIA ORIGGI</p><p>Philosopher, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris; editor, Text-e: Text in the Age of the Internet</p><p>‚ÄúThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,‚Äù says Hamlet to his friend Horatio.
