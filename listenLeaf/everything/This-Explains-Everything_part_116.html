If thoughts consist of the manipulation of abstract symbols, just as computers process 0s and 1s, then how are such abstract symbols translated into meaningful cognitive representations? This so-called symbol-grounding problem has now been largely overcome, because many findings from cognitive science suggest that the brain does not translate incoming information into abstract symbols in the first place. Instead, sensory and perceptual inputs from everyday experience are taken in their modality-specific form, and they provide the building blocks of thoughts.</p><p>British empiricists such as Locke and Berkeley long ago recognized that cognition is inherently perceptual. But following the cognitive revolution in the 1950s, psychology treated the computer as the most appropriate model to study the mind. Now we know that a brain does not work like a computer. Its job is not to store or process information; instead, its job is to drive and control the actions of the brain‚Äôs large appendage, the body. A new revolution is taking shape, considered by some to bring an end to cognitivism, and ushering in a transformed kind of cognitive science‚Äînamely, an embodied cognitive science.</p><p>The basic claim is that the mind thinks in embodied metaphors. Early proponents of this idea were linguists, such as George Lakoff, and in recent years social psychologists have been conducting the relevant experiments, providing compelling evidence. But it does not stop here; there is also a reverse pathway. Because thinking is for doing, many bodily processes feed back into the mind to drive action.</p><p>Consider the following recent findings that relate to the basic spatial concept of verticality. Because moving around in space is a common physical experience, concepts such as ‚Äúup‚Äù or ‚Äúdown‚Äù are immediately meaningful relative to one‚Äôs own body. The concrete experience of verticality serves as a perfect scaffold for comprehending abstract concepts, such as morality: Virtue is up, whereas depravity is down. Good people are ‚Äúhigh-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúupstanding‚Äù citizens, whereas bad people are ‚Äúunderhanded‚Äù and the ‚Äúlow life‚Äù of society. Recent research by Brian Meier, Martin Sellbom, and Dustin Wygant illustrated that research participants are faster to categorize moral words when presented in an up location and immoral words when presented in a down location. Thus people intuitively relate the moral domain to verticality; however, Meier and colleagues also found that people who do not recognize moral norms‚Äînamely, psychopaths‚Äîfail to show this effect.*</p><p>People not only think of all things good and moral as up, but they also think of God as up and the Devil as down. Further, those in power are conceptualized as being high up relative to those over whom they hover and exert control, as shown by Thomas Schubert.* All the empirical evidence suggests that there is indeed a conceptual dimension that leads up, both literally and metaphorically. This vertical dimension that pulls the mind up to considering what higher power there might be is deeply rooted in the basic physical experience of verticality.</p><p>Verticality not only influences people‚Äôs representation of what is good, moral, and divine, but movement through space along the vertical dimension can even change their moral actions. Lawrence Sanna, Edward Chang, Paul Miceli, and Kristjen Lundberg recently demonstrated that manipulating people‚Äôs location along the vertical dimension can turn them into more ‚Äúhigh-minded‚Äù and ‚Äúupstanding‚Äù citizens. They found that people in a shopping mall who had just moved up an escalator were more likely to contribute to a charity donation box than people who had moved down on the escalator. Similarly, research participants who had watched a film depicting a view from high above‚Äînamely, flying over clouds seen from an airplane window‚Äîsubsequently showed more cooperative behavior than participants who had watched a more ordinary, and less ‚Äúelevating,‚Äù view from a car window. Thus being physically elevated induced people to act on ‚Äúhigher‚Äù moral values.*</p><p>The growing recognition that embodied metaphors provide a common language of the mind has led to fundamentally different ways of studying how people think. For example, under the assumption that the mind functions like a computer, psychologists hoped to figure out how people think by observing how they play chess or memorize lists of random words. From an embodied perspective, it is evident that such scientific attempts were doomed to fail. It is increasingly clear that cognitive operations of any creature, including humans, have to solve certain adaptive challenges of the physical environment. In the process, embodied metaphors are the building blocks of perception, cognition, and action. It doesn‚Äôt get much more simple and elegant than that.</p><p>METAPHORS ARE IN THE MIND</p><p>BENJAMIN K.
