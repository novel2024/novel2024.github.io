We all live in multiple time zones, learned from childhood, shaped by education, culture, social class, and experiences with economic and family stability or instability. Most of us develop a biased temporal orientation that favors one time frame over others, becoming excessively oriented to past, present, or future.</p><p>Thus, at decision time for major or minor judgments, some of us are totally influenced by factors in the immediate situation: what others are doing, saying, urging, and one‚Äôs own biological urges. Others facing the same decision matrix ignore all those present qualities, focusing instead on the past: the similarities between current and prior settings, remembering what was done and its effects. A third set of decision makers ignores the present and the past and focuses primarily on the future consequences of current actions, calculating costs vs. gains.</p><p>To complicate matters, there are subdomains of each of these primary time zones. Some past-oriented people tend to focus on negatives in their earlier experiences (regret, failure, abuse, trauma), while others are primarily past-positive, focusing instead on the good old days, nostalgia, gratitude, and successes. There are two ways to be present-oriented: to live in a present-hedonistic domain (seeking pleasure, novelty, sensation) or being present-fatalistic, believing nothing you do can change your future. Future-oriented people are goal setters, who plan strategies, which tend to be successful; but another future focus is on the transcendental future‚Äîlife begins after death of the mortal body.</p><p>My interest in time-perspective theory inspired me to create an inventory so as to determine exactly the extent to which we fit into each of these six time zones. The Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, or ZTPI, correlates scores on these time dimensions with a host of other psychological traits and behaviors. We have demonstrated that time perspective has a major effect in a vast domain of human nature. In fact, some of the relationships uncovered reveal correlation coefficients much greater than any seen in traditional personality assessments. For example, future orientation correlates .70 with the trait of conscientiousness, which in turn predicts longevity. Present hedonism correlates .70 with sensation-seeking and novelty-seeking. Those high on past-negative are most likely to be high on measures of anxiety, depression, and anger, with correlations as robust as .75. Similarly substantial correlations are uncovered between present fatalism and these measures of personal distress. I should add that this confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on a sample of functioning college students, thus such effects should be cause for alarm by counselors. Beyond mere correlations of scale measures, the ZTPI scales predict a wide range of behaviors: course grades, risk-taking, alcohol, drug use and abuse, environmental conservation, medical checkups, creativity, problem solving, and much more.</p><p>Finally, one of the most surprising discoveries is the application of time-perspective theory to time therapy in ‚Äúcuring‚Äù PTSD in veterans, sexually abused women, or people suffering from motor-vehicle fatality experiences. Drs. Richard and Rosemary Sword have been treating with remarkably positive outcomes a number of veterans from recent U.S. wars and also civilian clients. The core of the treatment replaces the past-negative and present-fatalistic biased time zones common to those suffering from PTSD with a balanced time perspective that highlights the critical role of the hope-filled future, adds some selected present hedonism, and introduces memories of a past-positive nature. In a sample of thirty PTSD vets of varying ages and ethnicities treated with time perspective therapy for relatively few sessions (compared to traditional cognitive behavioral therapies), dramatic positive changes were found for all PTSD standard assessments, as well as in life-changing social and professional relationships. It is rewarding to see many of our veterans, who have continued to suffer for decades from their combat-related severe traumas, discover a new life rich with opportunities, friends, family, fun, and work by being exposed to this simple, elegant reframing of their mental orientation.</p><p>DEVELOPMENTAL TIMING EXPLAINS THE WOES OF ADOLESCENCE</p><p>ALISON GOPNIK</p><p>Professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California‚ÄìBerkeley; author, The Philosophical Baby</p><p>‚ÄúWhat was he thinking?‚Äù This is the familiar bewildered cry of parents trying to explain why their teenaged children act the way they do. Developmental psychologists, neuroscientists, and clinicians have an interesting and elegant explanation for teenage weirdness. It applies to a wide range of adolescent behavior, from the surprisingly admirable to the mildly annoying to the downright pathological. The idea is that there are two different neural and functional systems that interact to turn children into adults. The developmental relationship between those two systems has changed, and that, in turn, has profoundly changed adolescence.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_161.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_163.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
