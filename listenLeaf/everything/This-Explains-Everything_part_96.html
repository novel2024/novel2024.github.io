There even seems to be a missing link‚Äîthere are rather vile, smelly, bottom-feeding critters called acorn worms that have nerve cords on the back and the front and guts that seem on their way to moving on down.</p><p>So the reason we humans have a backbone is not because it‚Äôs somehow better to have a spinal column to break a fall backward, or anything of the sort. Roll the dice again and we could be bipeds with spinal columns running down our fronts like zippers and the guts carried in the back (this actually doesn‚Äôt sound half bad). This explanation of what‚Äôs called dorsoventral inversion is yet more evidence of how, under natural selection, such awesome variety can emerge in unbroken fashion from such humble beginnings. And finally it‚Äôs hard not to be heartened by a scientific explanation that early adopters, like Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, were ridiculed for espousing.</p><p>Quite often when I‚Äôm preparing shrimp, or tearing open a lobster, or contemplating what it would be like to be forced to dissect an acorn worm, or patting my cat on the belly, or giving someone a hug, I think a bit about the fact that all these bodies are built on the same plan, except that the cat‚Äôs and the huggee‚Äôs bodies are the legacy of some worm swimming the wrong way up in a Precambrian ocean more than 550 million years ago. It has always struck me as rather gorgeous.</p><p>GERMS CAUSE DISEASE</p><p>GREGORY COCHRAN</p><p>Consultant, Adaptive Optics; adjunct professor of anthropology, University of Utah; coauthor (with Henry Harpending), The 10,000-Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution</p><p>The germ theory of disease has been very successful, particularly if you care about practical payoffs like staying alive. It explains how disease can rapidly spread to large numbers of people (exponential growth), why there are so many different diseases (distinct pathogen species), and why some kind of contact (sometimes indirect) is required for disease transmission. In modern language, most disease syndromes turn out to be caused by tiny self-replicating machines whose genetic interests are not closely aligned with ours.</p><p>In fact, germ theory has been so successful that it almost seems uninteresting. Once we understood the causes of cholera and pneumonia and syphilis, we got rid of them, at least in the wealthier countries. Now we‚Äôre at the point where people resist the means of victory‚Äîvaccination, for example‚Äîbecause they no longer remember the threat.</p><p>It‚Äôs still worth studying‚Äînot just to fight the next plague but also because it has been a major factor in human history and human evolution. You can‚Äôt really understand Cortez without smallpox or Keats without tuberculosis. The past is another country‚Äîdon‚Äôt drink the water.</p><p>It may well explain patterns we aren‚Äôt even supposed to see, let alone understand. For example, human intelligence was, until recently, ineffective at addressing problems caused by microparasites, as William McNeill has pointed out in Plagues and Peoples. Those invisible enemies played a major role in determining human biological fitness‚Äîmore so in some places than others. Consider the implications.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_95.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_97.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
