But they are elegant and non-obvious, and some of them verge on beautiful.</p><p>HOW DO YOU GET FROM A LOBSTER TO A CAT?</p><p>JOHN McWHORTER</p><p>Linguist; senior fellow, Manhattan Institute for Policy Research; author, What Language Is (And What It Isn‚Äôt and What It Could Be)</p><p>Did you ever notice that the ‚Äúvein‚Äù you are told to remove from shrimp before eating them doesn‚Äôt seem to ooze anything you‚Äôd be inclined to call blood? Doesn‚Äôt the slime seem more like some sort of alimentary waste? That‚Äôs because it is. In shrimp, you can get at the digestive system right through its back, because that‚Äôs where it is. The heart‚Äôs up there too, and this is the way it is in arthropods, the animal phylum that includes crustaceans and insects. Meanwhile, if you were interested in finding the shrimp‚Äôs main nerve highway, you‚Äôd find it running down along its bottom side.</p><p>That seems backwards to us, because we‚Äôre chordates, another big animal phylum. Chordates have the spinal nerve running down the back, with the heart and gut in front. It‚Äôs as if our body plans were mirror images of arthropods‚Äô, and this is a microcosm of a general split between larger classes. Arthropods are among the protostomes, with the guts on the back, as opposed to the deuterostomes that we chordates are among, with the guts up front.</p><p>Biologists have noticed this since auld lang syne, with naturalist √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire turning a dissected lobster upside down and showing that as such, its innards‚Äô arrangement resembled ours. The question was how things got this way, especially as Darwin‚Äôs natural-selection theory became accepted. How could one get step-by-step from the guts on the back and the spinal cord up front to the reverse situation? More to the point, why would this be evolutionarily advantageous, which is the only reason we assume it would happen at all?</p><p>Short of imagining that the nerve cord glommed upward and took over the gut and a new gut spontaneously developed down below because it was ‚Äúneeded‚Äù‚Äîthis idea was actually entertained for a while by one venturesome thinker‚Äîthe best that biologists could do for a long time was to suppose that the arthropod plan and the chordate plan were alternative pathways of evolution from some primordial creature; just a matter of the roll of the dice, they thought.</p><p>Not only was this explanation boring, the problem was also that molecular biology was making it ever clearer that arthropods and chordates trace back to the same basic body plan in a good amount of detail. The shrimp‚Äôs little segments are generated by the same genes that create our vertebral column, and so on. Which leads back to the old question: How do you get from a lobster to a cat? Biologists are converging upon an answer that combines elegance with a touch of mystery, with a scintilla of humility in the bargain.</p><p>What‚Äôs increasingly thought to have happened is that some early wormlike aquatic creature with the arthropod-style body plan started swimming upside down. Creatures can do that‚Äîbrine shrimp today, for example. Often it‚Äôs because a creature‚Äôs coloring is different on top than on the bottom, and having the top color down makes them harder for predators to see. So there would have been evolutionary advantage to such a creature turning upside down forever. In this creature, the spinal cord was up and the guts were down. By itself, this story is perhaps cute, maybe a little sad, but not much more. But suppose this little worm then evolved into today‚Äôs chordates? It‚Äôs hardly a stretch, given that the most primitive chordates actually are wormish, only vaguely piscine things called lancelets. And if you were moved to rip one open, you‚Äôd see that nerve cord on the back, not the front.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_94.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_96.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
