Observations deemed paradoxical in the standard view emerge seamlessly. The hypothesis makes testable predictions‚Äîfor example, that many other oxidative stress- and mitochondrial-disruption-inducing exposures that have not yet been assessed will promote one or more elements of MetSyn. For factors that relate at both extremes to MetSyn‚Äîsay, short and long sleep duration‚Äîthe energy-disruptive one will prove to cause MetSyn and the energy-supportive one to serve as a fellow adaptive consequence.</p><p>This reframing addresses an important problem. Some think MetSyn is slated to reverse the gains we have made in longevity. The conclusion might be surprising‚Äîand should precipitate a revision in our thinking not just about the causes of MetSyn but also about its solutions.</p><p>DEATH IS THE FINAL REPAYMENT</p><p>EMANUEL DERMAN</p><p>Professor of professional practice, Columbia University; former managing director, Goldman Sachs; author, Models.
