This is important because rational decision making is very difficult when there are many variables and unknowns. Having an internal system that quickly delivers good guesses is a great advantage, and may make the difference between life and death when a quick decision is needed. TD learning depends on the sum of your life experiences. It extracts what is essential from these experiences long after the details of the individual experiences are no longer remembered.</p><p>TD learning also explains many of the experiments performed by psychologists who trained rats and pigeons in simple tasks. Reinforcement learning algorithms have traditionally been considered too weak to explain complex behaviors, because the feedback from the environment is minimal. Nonetheless, reinforcement learning is universal among nearly all species and is responsible for some of the most complex forms of sensorimotor coordination, such as piano playing and speech. Reinforcement learning has been honed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. It has served countless species well, particularly our own.</p><p>How complex a problem can TD learning solve? TD-Gammon is a computer program that learned how to play backgammon by playing itself. The difficulty with this approach is that the reward comes only at the end of the game, so it‚Äôs not clear which were the good moves that led to the win. TD-Gammon started out with no knowledge of the game, except for the rules. By playing itself many times and applying TD learning to create a value function to evaluate game positions, TD-Gammon climbed from beginner to expert level, along the way picking up subtle strategies similar to ones that humans use. After playing itself a million times, it reached championship level and was discovering new positional play that astonished human experts. Similar approaches to the game of Go have achieved impressive levels of performance and are on track to reach professional levels.</p><p>When there‚Äôs a combinatorial explosion of possible outcomes, selective pruning is helpful. Attention and working memory allow us to focus on most of the important parts of a problem. Reinforcement learning is also supercharged by our declarative memory system, which tracks unique objects and events. When large brains evolved in primates, the increased memory capacity greatly enhanced their ability to make complex decisions, leading to longer sequences of actions to achieve goals. We are the only species to create an educational system and to consign ourselves to years of instruction and tests. Delayed gratification can extend into the distant future (in some cases, into an imagined afterlife), a tribute to the power of dopamine to control behavior.</p><p>At the beginning of the cognitive revolution in the 1960s, the brightest minds could not imagine that reinforcement learning could underlie intelligent behavior. Minds are not reliable. Nature is cleverer than we are.</p><p>IMPOSING RANDOMNESS</p><p>MICHAEL I. NORTON</p><p>Associate professor of business administration and Marvin Bower Fellow, Harvard Business School</p><p>Paul Meier, who passed away in 2011, was primarily known for his introduction of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. But Meier was also a seminal figure in the widespread adoption of an invaluable explanatory tool: the randomized experiment. The decided unsexiness of the term masks a truly elegant form, which in the hands of its best practitioners approaches art. Simply put, experiments offer a unique and powerful means for devising answers to the question that scientists across disciplines seek to answer: How do we know whether something works?</p><p>Take a question that appears anew in the media each year: Is red wine good or bad for us? We learn a great deal about how red wine works by asking people about their consumption and health and looking for correlations between the two. To estimate the specific impact of red wine on health, though, we need to ask people a lot of questions‚Äîabout everything they consume (food, prescription medication, more unsavory forms of medication), their habits (exercise, sleep, sexual activity), their past (their health history, their parents‚Äô and grandparents‚Äô health histories), and on and on‚Äîand then try to control for these factors to isolate the impact of wine on health. Think of the length of the survey.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_165.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_167.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
