Democritus called the smallest indivisible particle of matter √°tomos, meaning ‚Äúuncuttable.‚Äù Atoms were also simple, eternal, and unalterable. But in Greek thinking (and generally for about 2,000 years after), atoms lost out to the four basic elements of Empedocles‚Äîfire, air, water, earth‚Äîwhich were also simple, eternal, and unalterable but not made up of little particles, Aristotle believing those four elements to be infinitely continuous.</p><p>Further progress in our understanding of the world, based on the concept of atoms, had to wait until the 18th century. By that time, the four elements of Aristotle had been replaced by the thirty-three elements of Lavoisier, based on chemical analysis. Dalton then used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of whole numbers, proposing that each element is made up of atoms of a single type and that these atoms can combine to form chemical compounds. Of course, by the early 20th century (through the work of Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, and many others), it was realized that atoms were not indivisible and thus not the basic units of matter. All atoms were made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, which took over the title of being the indivisible components (basic building blocks) of matter.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_137.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_139.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
