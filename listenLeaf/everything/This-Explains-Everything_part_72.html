Mathematical thinking is essentially another manifestation of the brain‚Äôs simulation capacity, but in quantitative/relational/logical terms rather than descriptive/communicative.</p><p>As is usually the case with natural-selection arguments, it takes considerable work to flesh out the details of these simplistic explanations (and some days I‚Äôm less convinced than others about some aspects), but overall they strike me as about right. In particular, the mathematical story explains why doing mathematics carries with it an overpowering Platonic sense of reasoning not about abstractions but about real objects‚Äîat least ‚Äúreal‚Äù in a Platonic realm. At which point, the lifelong mathematics educator in me says I should leave the proof of that corollary as an exercise for the reader‚Äîso I shall.</p><p>COMMITMENT</p><p>RICHARD H. THALER</p><p>Theorist, behavioral economics; director, Center for Decision Research, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago; coauthor (with Cass R. Sunstein), Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</p><p>It is a fundamental principle of economics that a person is always better off if they have more alternatives to choose from. But this principle is wrong. There are cases when I can make myself better off by restricting my future choices and committing myself to a specific course of action.</p><p>The idea of commitment as a strategy is an ancient one. Odysseus famously had his crew tie him to the mast so he could listen to the sirens‚Äô songs without steering the ship into the rocks. Another classic is Cortez‚Äôs decision to burn his ships upon arriving in South America, thus removing retreat as one of the options his crew could consider. But although the idea is an old one, we did not understand its nuances until Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote his 1956 masterpiece: ‚ÄúAn Essay on Bargaining.‚Äù</p><p>It is well known that games such as the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma work out if both players can credibly commit themselves to cooperating, but how can I convince you that I will cooperate when it is a dominant strategy for me to defect? (And if you and I are game theorists, you know that I know that you know that I know that defecting is a dominant strategy.) Schelling gives many examples of how this can be done, but here‚Äôs my favorite: A Denver rehabilitation clinic whose clientele consisted of wealthy cocaine addicts offered a ‚Äúself-blackmail‚Äù strategy. Patients were offered an opportunity to write a self-incriminating letter, which would be delivered if and only if the patient, who would be tested on a random schedule, was found to have used cocaine. Most patients would now have a very strong incentive to stay off drugs; they were committed.</p><p>Many of society‚Äôs thorniest problems, from climate change to Middle East conflict, could be solved if the relevant parties could only find a way to commit themselves to some future course of action. They would be well advised to study Tom Schelling in order to figure out how to make that commitment.</p><p>TIT FOR TAT</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_71.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_73.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
