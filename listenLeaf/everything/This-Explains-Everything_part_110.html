But with this assumption, we arrive at another contradiction. Suppose, for example, that after a small interval of time the speed of the faster body is 11 and that of the slower body is 7. But this would mean that they aren‚Äôt moving at the same velocity, and the front surface of the faster body would advance through the rear surface of the slower body, which is impossible because we have assumed that the bodies are impenetrable. It therefore becomes apparent that the interaction must take place immediately before the impact of the two bodies and that this interaction can only be a repulsive one, because it is expressed in the slowing down of one body and the speeding up of the other.</p><p>Moreover, this argument is valid for arbitrary speeds, so one can no longer speak of definite dimensions for the particles (namely, the atoms) that were until now thought of as impenetrable. An atom should be viewed, rather, as a point source of force, with the force emanating from it acting in some complicated fashion that depends on distance.</p><p>According to Boscovich, when bodies are far apart, they act on each other through a force corresponding to the gravitational force, which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. But with decreasing distance, this law must be modified, because, in accordance with the above considerations, the force changes sign and must become a repulsive force. Boscovich even plotted fanciful traces of how the force should vary with distance in which the force changed sign several times, hinting at the existence of minima in the potential and the existence of stable bonds between the particles, or atoms.</p><p>With this idea, Boscovich not only offered a new picture for interactions in place of the Aristotelian-Cartesian theory based on immediate contact, but also presaged our understanding of the structure of matter, especially that of solid bodies.</p><p>BIRDS ARE THE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF DINOSAURS</p><p>GREGORY S. PAUL</p><p>Independent researcher; author, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs</p><p>The most graceful example of an elegant scientific idea in one of my fields of expertise is the idea that dinosaurs were tachyenergetic‚Äîthat they were endotherms with the high internal-energy production and high aerobic-exercise capacity typical of birds and mammals that can sustain long periods of intense activity. Although not dependent on it, the high-powered-dinosaur idea meshes with the hypothesis that birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs‚Äîthat birds are flying dinosaurs, much as bats are flying mammals.</p><p>The sense that the tachyenergetic idea makes cannot be overemphasized, nor can the degree to which it revolutionized a big chunk of our understanding of evolution and 230 million years of Earth history, relative to what was thought from the mid-1800s to the 1960s. Until then, it was generally presumed that dinosaurs were a dead-end collection of bradyenergetic reptiles that could achieve high levels of activity for only brief bursts; even walking at a rate of 5 mph requires high respiratory capacity, beyond that of reptiles, who must plod along at a mile per hour or so if they are moving over a long distance. Birds were seen as a distinct and feathery group in which energy inefficiency evolved in order to power flight. Although the latter hypothesis was not inherently illogical, it was divergent from the evolution of bats, whose high aerobic capacity was already present in their furry ancestors.</p><p>I first learned of ‚Äúwarm-blooded‚Äù dinosaurs in my senior year of high school, via a blurb in Smithsonian Magazine about Robert Bakker‚Äôs article in Nature in the summer of 1972. As soon as I read it, it just clicked. I had been illustrating dinosaurs in accord with the reptilian consensus, but it was a bad fit, because dinosaurs are so obviously constructed like birds and mammals, not crocs and lizards. About the same time, John Ostrom, who also had a hand in discovering dinosaur endothermy, was presenting the evidence that birds are aerial versions of avepod dinosaurs‚Äîa concept so obvious that it should have become the dominant thesis back in the 1800s.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_109.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_111.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
