For example, the binding of matter, energy, and spacetime in general relativity seemed (and indeed is) an extraordinarily elegant and deep explanation.</p><p>Nowadays I am even more compelled by powerful explanations that lie behind the things we see around us that are too easily taken for granted. And I find myself drawn to a context experienced every day by just about everybody.</p><p>How generous is that himself the sun</p><p>‚Äîarriving truly, faithfully who goes</p><p>(never for a moment ceasing to begin</p><p>the mystery of day for someone‚Äôs eyes)</p><p>Thus wrote e. e. cummings in the opening of his lyrical celebration of our star. Those words highlight a daily moment‚Äîa sunrise‚Äîwhose associated human sense of (in)significance and mystery may for some be only deepened by appreciating (at least) three great explanations underlying the experience. And each has at least one of the Edge Question‚Äôs requested qualities: depth, elegance, and beauty.</p><p>If you care about such things, and (like me) live at a northern middle latitude, you will know the range of the horizon visible from your home, between roughly southeast and northeast, across which the point of sunrise shifts back and forth over the year, with sunrise getting later as it moves northward and the days shorten, and the motion reversing at the winter solstice. And beyond that quite complex behavior is the simple truth of the sun‚Äôs fidelity‚Äîwe can indeed trust it to come up somewhere in the east every morning.</p><p>Like a great work of art, a great scientific explanation loses none of its power to inspire awe afresh whenever one contemplates it. So it is with the explanation that those daily and annual cycles of sunrises are explicable by a tilted rotating Earth orbiting the sun, whose average axial direction can be considered fixed relative to the stars thanks to a still-mysterious conservation law.</p><p>Unlike my two other chosen explanations, this one encountered skepticism from scientists for decades. The heliocentric view of the solar system, articulated by Copernicus in the mid 16th century, was not widely accepted until well into the 17th. For me, that triumph over the combination of scientific skepticism and religious hostility only adds to the explanation‚Äôs appeal.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_157.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_159.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
