Lord Rayleigh succeeded James Clerk Maxwell as Cavendish professor of physics at Cambridge. One of his early achievements was to deduce laws of the scattering of light. His first effort reached the right answer on an invalid foundation‚Äîthe scattering of light in an elastic aether. Although the existence of such an aether wasn‚Äôt shown to be a fallacy until some years later, he redid his calculations using Maxwell‚Äôs deeply unifying theories of electromagnetism. ‚ÄúRayleigh scattering‚Äù is the expression of those theories in contexts where an electromagnetic wave encounters electrically polarized particles much smaller than its wavelength. The amount of scattering, Rayleigh discovered, is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. By 1899, he had shown that air molecules themselves were powerful scatterers.</p><p>There, in one bound, is the essential explanation of why the sky is blue and why sunrises are reddened. Blue light is scattered much more by air molecules than light of longer wavelengths. The sun‚Äôs disk is accordingly reddened, and all the more so when seen through the long atmospheric path at sunrise and sunset. (To fully account for the effect, you also need to take into account the sun‚Äôs spectrum and the visual responses of human eyes.) The pink clouds that can add so much to the beauty of a sunrise consist of comparatively large droplets that scatter the wavelengths of reddened sunlight more equally than air molecules‚Äîcolorwise, what you see is what they get.</p><p>The third explanation behind a sunrise is conceptually and cosmologically the deepest. What is happening in the sun to generate its seemingly eternal light and heat? Understanding the nuclear reactions at the sun‚Äôs core was just a part of an explanation that, thanks especially to Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle in 1957,* simultaneously allowed us to understand not only the light from many kinds of stars but also how almost all the naturally occurring chemical elements are produced throughout the universe: in chains of reactions occurring within stable and cataclysmically unstable cosmic balls of gas in their various stages of stellar evolution, driven by the shifting influences of all the fundamental forces of nature‚Äîgravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.</p><p>Edge readers know that scientific understanding enhances rather than destroys nature‚Äôs beauty. All of these explanations, for me, contribute to the beauty in a sunrise.</p><p>Ah, but what is the explanation of beauty? Brain scientists grapple with nuclear-magnetic-resonance images; a recent meta-analysis indicated that all of our aesthetic judgments seem to include the use of neural circuits in the right anterior insula, an area of the cerebral cortex typically associated with visceral perception. Perhaps our sense of beauty is a by-product of the evolutionary maintenance of the senses of belonging and of disgust. For what it‚Äôs worth, as exoplanets pour out of our telescopes, I believe we will encounter astrochemical evidence for some form of extraterrestrial organism well before we achieve a deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation of human aesthetics.</p><p>THE ORIGIN OF MONEY</p><p>DYLAN EVANS</p><p>Founder and CEO of Projection Point; author, Risk Intelligence: How to Live with Uncertainty</p><p>Carl Menger‚Äôs account of the origin of money is my favorite scientific explanation. It‚Äôs deeply satisfying because it shows how money can develop from barter without anyone consciously inventing it. As such, it‚Äôs a great example of Adam Smith‚Äôs Invisible Hand, or what scientists now call ‚Äúemergence.‚Äù</p><p>Menger (1840‚Äì1921) founded the Austrian school of economics, a heterodox school of thought derided by many mainstream economists. Yet their accounts of the origin of money beg the very question Menger answered. The typical mainstream-economics textbook lists the problems of barter exchange and then explains how money overcomes these problems. However, that doesn‚Äôt really explain how money actually got started, any more than listing the advantages of air travel explains how airplanes were invented. As Lawrence White puts it in The Theory of Monetary Institutions (1999), ‚Äú[O]ne is left with the impression that barterers, one morning, suddenly became alert to the benefits of monetary exchange, and, by that afternoon, were busy using some good as money.‚Äù</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_158.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_160.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
