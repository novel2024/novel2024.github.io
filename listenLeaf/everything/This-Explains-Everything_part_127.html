This notion‚Äîthe 1965 brainchild of chemist James Lovelock, further developed with microbiologist Lynn Margulis‚Äîproposes that air (atmosphere), water (hydrosphere), Earth (geosphere), and life (biosphere) interact to form a single evolving system capable of maintaining environmental conditions consistent with life. Lovelock initially put forth the Gaia hypothesis to explain how life on Earth has persisted for almost 4 billion years despite a 30 percent increase in the sun‚Äôs intensity over that interval.</p><p>But how does Gaia work? Lovelock and Margulis demonstrated that, lacking a conscious command-and-control system, Gaia uses feedback loops to track and adjust key environmental parameters. Take oxygen, a highly reactive by-product of life, generated and continually replenished by photosynthetic algae and plants. The present atmospheric concentration of oxygen is about 21 percent. A few percentage points lower and air-breathing life-forms could not survive; a few percentage points higher and terrestrial ecosystems would become overly combustible, prone to conflagration. According to the Gaia hypothesis, oxygen-producing organisms have used feedback loops to maintain atmospheric oxygen between these narrow limits for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>Similar arguments, backed by an ever-growing body of research, can be made for other atmospheric constituents, as well as for global surface temperature, ocean salinity, and other key environmental metrics. Although the Gaia hypothesis highlights cooperation at the scale of the biosphere, researchers have documented multiple examples showing how cooperation at one level could evolve through competition and natural selection at lower levels. Initially criticized by serious scientists as New Age mumbo-jumbo, Lovelock‚Äôs radical notion has increasingly been incorporated into scientific orthodoxy, and key elements are now often taught as ‚ÄúEarth systems science.‚Äù One timely lesson resulting at least in part from Gaian research is that food-web complexity, including higher species diversity, tends to enhance ecological and climate stability.</p><p>So, while Earth may inhabit a Goldilocks zone‚Äîneither too close nor too far from the sun‚Äîlife‚Äôs rampant success on this ‚Äúpale blue dot‚Äù cannot be ascribed to luck alone. Life has had a direct hand in ensuring its own persistence.</p><p>Science has not yet fully embraced the Gaia hypothesis. And it must be admitted that as an explanation, the idea remains incomplete. The insights cascading from Gaia are unquestionably deep and beautiful, uniting the whole of the biosphere and Earth‚Äôs surface processes into a single, emergent, self-regulating system. But this explanation has yet to achieve the third milestone defined in this year‚Äôs Edge Question: elegance. The Gaia hypothesis lacks the mathematical precision of Einstein‚Äôs e = mc2. No unified theory of Earth and life has been presented to explain why life stabilizes more than it destabilizes.</p><p>Evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton once compared Lovelock‚Äôs insights to those of Copernicus, adding that we still await the Newton who will define the laws of this grand, seemingly improbable relationship. Hamilton himself became deeply engrossed in seeking an answer to this question, developing a computer model that seemed to show how stability and productivity could increase in tandem. Were it not for his untimely death, he might have emerged as that modern-day Newton.</p><p>The cultural implications of Gaia also continue to be debated. Arguably the most profound implication of Lovelock‚Äôs idea is that Earth considered as a whole has many qualities of an organism. But is Gaia actually alive, akin to a single life-form, or is it more accurate to think of her as a planet-size ecosystem? Lynn Margulis argued strongly (and convincingly, to my mind) for the latter view. Margulis, whose work revolutionized evolutionary biology at the smallest and grandest of scales, died last year. Always the hard-nosed scientist, she once said, ‚ÄúGaia is a tough bitch‚Äîa system that has worked for over 3 billion years without people. This planet‚Äôs surface and its atmosphere and environment will continue to evolve long after people and prejudice are gone.‚Äù</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_126.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_128.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
