In physics, that means a simple equation or a very general principle. I have to admit, though, that no equation or principle appeals to me more than Darwinian evolution, with the selfish-gene mechanism thrown in. To me, it has what the best physics explanations have: a kind of mathematical inevitability. But there are many people who can explain evolution better than I, so I will stick to what I know best.</p><p>The guiding star for me, as a physicist, has always been Ludwig Boltzmann‚Äôs explanation of the second law of thermodynamics‚Äîthe law that says that entropy never decreases. To the physicists of the late 19th century, this was a very serious paradox. Nature is full of irreversible phenomena‚Äîthings that easily happen but could not possibly happen in reverse order. However, the fundamental laws of physics are completely reversible: Any solution of Newton‚Äôs equations can be run backwards and it‚Äôs still a solution. So if entropy can increase, the laws of physics say it must be able to decrease. But experience says otherwise. For example, if you watch a movie of a nuclear explosion in reverse, you know very well that it‚Äôs fake. As a rule, things go one way and not the other. Entropy increases.</p><p>What Boltzmann realized is that the second law‚Äîentropy never decreases‚Äîis not a law in the same sense as Newton‚Äôs law of gravity or Faraday‚Äôs law of induction. It‚Äôs a probabilistic law that has the same status as the following obvious claim: If you flip a coin a million times, you will not get a million heads. It simply won‚Äôt happen. But is it possible? Yes, it is; it violates no law of physics. Is it likely? Not at all. Boltzmann‚Äôs formulation of the second law was very similar. Instead of saying entropy does not decrease, he said entropy probably doesn‚Äôt decrease. But if you wait around long enough in a closed environment, you will eventually see entropy decrease; by accident, particles and dust will come together and form a perfectly assembled bomb. How long? According to Boltzmann‚Äôs principles, the answer is the exponential of the entropy created when the bomb explodes. That‚Äôs a very long time, a lot longer than the time it takes to flip a million heads in a row.</p><p>I‚Äôll give you a simple example to see how it‚Äôs possible for things to be more probable one way than the other, despite both being possible. Imagine a high hill that comes to a narrow point‚Äîa needle point‚Äîat the top. Now imagine a bowling ball balanced at the top of the hill. A tiny breeze comes along. The ball rolls off the hill, and you catch it at the bottom. Next, run it in reverse: The ball leaves your hand, rolls up the hill, and with infinite finesse, comes to the top‚Äîand stops! Is it possible? It is. Is it likely? It is not. You would have to have almost perfect precision to get the ball to the top, let alone to have it stop dead-balanced. The same is true with the bomb. If you could reverse every atom and particle with sufficient accuracy, you could make the explosion products reassemble themselves. But a tiny inaccuracy in the motion of just one single particle and all you would get is more junk.</p><p>Here‚Äôs another example: Drop a bit of black ink into a tub of water. The ink spreads out and eventually makes the water gray. Will a tub of gray water ever clear up and produce a small drop of ink? Not impossible, but very unlikely.</p><p>Boltzmann was the first to understand the statistical foundation for the second law, but he was also the first to understand the inadequacy of his own formulation. Suppose you came upon a tub that had been filled a zillion years ago and had not been disturbed since. You notice the odd fact that it contains a somewhat localized cloud of ink. The first thing you might ask is, What will happen next? The answer is that the ink will almost certainly spread out more. But by the same token, if you ask what most likely took place a moment before, the answer would be the same: It was probably more spread out a moment ago than it is now. The most likely explanation would be that the ink blob is just a momentary fluctuation.</p><p>Actually, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd come to that conclusion at all. A much more reasonable explanation is that, for reasons unknown, the tub started not so long ago with a concentrated drop of ink, which then spread. Understanding why ink and water go one way becomes a problem of ‚Äúinitial conditions.‚Äù What set up the concentration of ink in the first place?</p><p>The water and ink is an analogy for the question of why entropy increases. It increases because it‚Äôs most likely that it will increase. But the equations say that it‚Äôs also most likely that it increases toward the past. To understand why we have this sense of direction, one must ask the same question Boltzmann did: Why was the entropy very small at the beginning? What created the universe in such a special low-entropy way? That‚Äôs a cosmological question we are still very uncertain about.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_38.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_40.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
