What fascinates me about this number is not how huge it is but how tiny. Indeed, a typical dish has about eight ingredients. Thus the roughly 300 ingredients used in cooking today allow for about a quadrillion distinct dishes. Add to this your choice of deep-freezing, frying, smashing, centrifuging, or blasting your ingredients and you start to see why cooking is a growth industry. It currently uses only a negligible fraction of its resources‚Äîless than one in a trillion dishes that culinary combinatorics permits.</p><p>Don‚Äôt you like green eggs and ham? Or why leave this vast terra incognita unexplored? Do we simply lack the time to taste our way through this boundless bounty, or is it because most combinations are repugnant? Could there be some rules that explain liking some ingredient combinations and avoiding others? The answer appears to be yes, which leads me to my most flavorful explanation to date.</p><p>As we search for evidence to support (or refute) any ‚Äúlaws‚Äù that may govern our culinary experiences, we must bear in mind that food sensation is affected by many factors, from color to texture, from temperature to sound. Yet palatability is largely determined by flavor, representing a group of sensations including odors, tastes, freshness, and pungency. This is mainly chemistry, however. Odors are molecules that bind olfactory receptors, tastes are chemicals that stimulate taste buds, freshness or pungency are signaled by chemical irritants in our mouth and throat. Therefore, if we want to understand why we prize some ingredient combinations and loathe others, we have to look at the chemical profile of our recipes.</p><p>But how can chemistry tell us which ingredients taste well together? Well, we can formulate two orthogonal hypotheses. First, we may like some ingredients together because their chemistry (henceforth, their flavor) is complementary‚Äîwhat one lacks is provided by the other. The alternative is the polar opposite: Taste is like color matching in fashion‚Äîwe prefer to pair ingredients that already share some flavor compounds, bringing them in chemical harmony with one another. Before you go on reading, I urge you to stop for a second and ponder which of these you find more plausible.</p><p>The first one makes more sense to me: I put salt in my omelet not because the chemical bouquet of the egg shares the salt‚Äôs only chemical, NaCl, but precisely because it is missing it. Yet lately, chefs and molecular gastronomers are betting on the second hypothesis, and they have even given it a name, calling it the food-pairing principle. Its consequences are already on your table. Some contemporary restaurants serve white chocolate with caviar because they share trimethylamine and other flavor compounds, or chocolate and blue cheese because they share at least seventy-three flavor compounds. Yet evidence for food pairing is at best anecdotal, making a scientist like myself ask: Is this more than a myth?</p><p>So whom should I trust, my intuition or the molecular gastronomers? And how to really test if two ingredients indeed go well together? Our first instinct was to taste, under controlled conditions, all ingredient pairs. Yet 300 ingredients offered about 44,850 pairs to sample, forcing us to search for smarter ways to settle the question. Having spent the last decade trying to understand the laws governing networks, from the social network to the intricate web of genes governing our cells, my colleagues and I decided to rely on network science. We compiled the flavor components of over 300 ingredients and organized them into a network, linking two ingredients if they shared flavor compounds. We then used the collective intelligence accumulated in the existing body of recipes to test what goes with what. If two common ingredients are almost never combined, like garlic and vanilla, there must be a reason for it; those who tried it may have found it either uninspired or outright repulsive. If, however, two ingredients are combined more often than we would expect, based on their individual popularity, we took that as a sign that they must taste well together. Tomato and garlic are in this category, combined in 12 percent of all recipes.*</p><p>The truth is rather Dr. Seussian at the end: We may like some combinations here, but not there. That is, North American and Western European cuisine show a strong tendency to combine ingredients that share chemicals. If you are here, serve parmesan with papaya and strawberries with beer. Do not try this there, however: East Asian cuisine thrives by avoiding ingredients that share flavor chemicals. So if you hail from Asia, yin/yang is your guiding force: seeking harmony through pairing the polar opposites. Do you like soy sauce with honey? Try them together and you might.</p><p>MOTHER NATURE‚ÄôS LAWS</p><p>STUART PIMM</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_142.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_144.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
