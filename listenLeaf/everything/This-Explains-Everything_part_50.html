In a world of scissors and schooldesks shaped for righties, being a lefty is not just annoying, it seems to be bad for you. According to a number of studies, lefties are at higher risk for disorders like schizophrenia, mental retardation, immune deficiency, epilepsy, learning disability, spinal deformity, hypertension, ADHD, alcoholism, and stuttering.</p><p>Which brings me to Charlotte Faurie and Michel Raymond, a pair of French scientists who study the evolution of handedness. Left-handedness is partly heritable and is associated with significant health risks. So why, they wondered, hadn‚Äôt natural selection trimmed it away? Were the costs of left-handedness canceled by hidden fitness benefits?</p><p>They noted that lefties have advantages in sports like baseball and fencing, where the competition is interactive, but not in sports like gymnastics or swimming, with no direct interaction. In the elite ranks of cricket, boxing, wrestling, tennis, baseball, and more, lefties are massively overrepresented. The reason is obvious: Since 90 percent of the world is right-handed, righties usually compete against one another. When they confront lefties, who do everything backwards, their brains reel, and the result can be as lopsided as my mauling by Nick. In contrast, lefties are used to facing righties; when two lefties face off, any confusion cancels out.</p><p>Faurie and Raymond made a mental leap. The lives of ancestral people were typically more violent than our own. Wouldn‚Äôt the lefty advantage in sports‚Äîincluding combat sports like boxing, wrestling, and fencing‚Äîhave extended to fighting, whether with fists, clubs, or spears? Could the fitness benefits of fighting southpaw have offset the health costs associated with left-handedness? In 2005, they published a paper supporting their prediction of a strong correlation between violence and handedness in preindustrial societies: The more violent the society, the more lefties. The most violent society they sampled, the Eipo of highland New Guinea, was almost 30 percent southpaw.*</p><p>What makes a scientific explanation beautiful? General factors like parsimony play a role, but as with any aesthetic question, quirks of personal taste bulk large. Why do I find the Faurie-Raymond hypothesis attractive? Partly because it was an almost recklessly creative idea, and yet the data seemed to fit. But mainly because the undoubtable truth of it was pounded into my brain by a young soldier sometime last year.</p><p>This is not to say, with apologies to Keats, that beauty and truth are synonyms. Sometimes the truth turns out to be dull and flat. Many of the loveliest explanations‚Äîthe ones we adore with almost parental fondness‚Äîturn out to be dead false. This is what T. H. Huxley called scientific tragedy, ‚Äúthe slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.‚Äù Many studies have since examined the Faurie-Raymond hypothesis. Results have been mixed, but facts have surfaced that are, to my taste, quite decidedly ugly. A recent and impressive inquiry found no evidence that lefties are overrepresented among the Eipo of highland New Guinea.*</p><p>It hurts to surrender a beloved idea, one you just knew was true, one that was stamped into your mind by lived experience, not statistics. And I‚Äôm not yet ready to consign this one to the boneyard of lovely but dead science. Faurie and Raymond brought in sports data to shore up their main story about fighting. But I think the sports data may actually be the main story. Lefty genes may have survived more through southpaw success in play fights than in real fights‚Äîa possibility Faurie and Raymond acknowledge in a later paper.* Athletic contests are important across cultures. Around the world, sport is mainly a male preserve, and winners‚Äîfrom captains of football teams to traditional African wrestlers to Native American runners and lacrosse players‚Äîgain more than mere laurels: They elevate their cultural status; they win the admiration of men and the desire of women (research confirms the stereotype: Athletic men have more sexual success). This raises a broader possibility‚Äîthat our species has been shaped more than we know by the survival of the sportiest.</p><p>GROUP POLARIZATION</p><p>DAVID G.
