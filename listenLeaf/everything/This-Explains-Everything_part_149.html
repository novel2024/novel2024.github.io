One is coincidence, the other is d√©j√† vu. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre Queen Elizabeth, one of the thirty-three miners rescued in Chile, a South Korean housewife, or a migrant herder in Zimbabwe: In the span of 365 days, you will pretty much have two d√©j√† vus and one coincidence that makes you stop and say, ‚ÄúWow, that was a coincidence!‚Äù</p><p>The thing about coincidence is that when you imagine the umpteen trillions of coincidences that can happen at any given moment, the fact is that in practice, coincidences almost never occur. They‚Äôre so rare that when they do happen they‚Äôre memorable. This suggests to me that the universe is designed to ward off coincidence whenever possible. The universe hates coincidence; I don‚Äôt know why‚Äîit just seems to be true. So when a coincidence happens, that coincidence had to work awfully hard to escape the system. There‚Äôs a message there. What is it? Look. Look harder. Mathematicians perhaps have a theorem for this, and if they do, it might, by default, be a theorem for something larger than what they think it is.</p><p>What‚Äôs both eerie and interesting to me about d√©j√† vus is that they occur almost metronomically throughout our lives‚Äîabout once every six months, a poetic timekeeping device that, at the very least, reminds us we are alive. I can safely assume that my thirteen-year-old niece, Stephen Hawking, and someone working in a Beijing luggage factory each experience two d√©j√† vus a year. Not one. Not three. Two.</p><p>The underlying biodynamics of d√©j√† vu is probably ascribable to some sort of tingling neurons in a certain part of the brain, yet this doesn‚Äôt tell us why they exist. They seem to me to be a signal from a larger point of view that wants to remind us that our lives are distinct, that they have meaning, and that they occur throughout a span of time. We are important, and what makes us valuable to the universe is our sentience and our curse and blessing of perpetual self-awareness.</p><p>OCCAM‚ÄôS RAZOR</p><p>KATINKA MATSON</p><p>Artist; cofounder, Edge.org; president, Brockman, Inc.; author, Short Lives</p><p>Keep it simple.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_148.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_150.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
