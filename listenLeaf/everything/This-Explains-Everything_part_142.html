Like persistence of vision, this is a real effect, called apparent motion. It‚Äôs interesting, but it‚Äôs not the explanation I like so much. Classic cel animation‚Äîof the old ink-on-celluloid variety‚Äîrelies on the apparent-motion phenomenon. The old animators knew intuitively how to keep the successive frames of a movement inside the ‚Äúnot too far, not too fast‚Äù boundaries. If they needed to exceed those limits, they had tricks to help us perceive the motion‚Äîlike actual speed lines and a poof of dust to mark the rapid descent of Wile E. Coyote as he steps unexpectedly off a mesa in hot pursuit of that truly wily Road Runner.</p><p>Exceed the apparent-motion limits without those animators‚Äô tricks and the results are ugly. You may have seen old-school stop-motion animation‚Äîsuch as Ray Harryhausen‚Äôs classic sword-fighting skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts‚Äîplagued by an unpleasant jerking motion of the characters. You‚Äôre seeing double‚Äîseveral edges of a skeleton at the same time‚Äîand correctly interpreting it as motion, but painfully so. The edges stutter, or ‚Äújudder,‚Äù or ‚Äústrobe‚Äù across the screen‚Äîwords that reflect the pain inflicted by staccato motion.</p><p>Why don‚Äôt live-action movies judder? (Imagine directing Uma Thurman to stay within not-too-far-not-too-fast limits.) Why don‚Äôt computer-animated movies √† la Pixar judder? And, for contrast, why do videogames, alas, strobe horribly? All are sequences of discrete frames. There‚Äôs a general explanation that works for all three. It‚Äôs called motion blur, and it‚Äôs simple and pretty.</p><p>Here‚Äôs what a real movie camera does. The frame it records is not a sample at a single instant, like a Road Runner or a Harryhausen frame. Rather, the camera shutter is open for a short while, called the exposure time. A moving object is moving during that short interval, of course, and is thus smeared slightly across the frame during the exposure time. It‚Äôs like what happens when you try to take a long-exposure still photo of your child throwing a ball, and his arm is just a blur. But a bug in a still photograph turns out to be a feature for movies. Without the blur, all movies would look as jumpy as Harryhausen‚Äôs skeletons.</p><p>A scientific explanation can become a technological solution. For digital movies‚Äîlike Toy Story‚Äîthe solution to avoid strobing was derived from the explanation for live-action: Deliberately smear a moving object across a frame along its path of motion. So a character‚Äôs swinging arm must be blurred along the arc the arm traces as it pivots around its shoulder joint. And the other arm independently must be blurred along its arc, often in the opposite direction to the first arm. All that had to be done was to figure out how to do with a computer what a camera does‚Äîand, importantly, how to do it efficiently. Live-action movies get motion blur for free, but it costs a lot for digital movies. The solution‚Äîby the group now known as Pixar‚Äîpaved the way for the first digital movie. Motion blur was the crucial breakthrough.</p><p>In effect, motion blur shows your brain the path a movement is taking and also its magnitude‚Äîa longer blur means a faster motion. Instead of discarding the temporal information about motion between frames, we store it spatially in the frames as a blur. A succession of such frames overlapping a bit‚Äîbecause of persistence of vision‚Äîthus paints out a motion in a distinctive enough way that the brain can make the full inference.</p><p>Pixar throws thousands of computers at a movie‚Äîspending sometimes more than thirty hours on a single frame. On the other hand, a videogame‚Äîessentially a digital movie restricted to real time‚Äîhas to deliver a new frame every thirtieth of a second. It was only seventeen years ago that the inexorable increase in computation speed per unit dollar (described by Moore‚Äôs Law) made motion-blurred digital movies feasible. Videogames simply haven‚Äôt arrived yet. They can‚Äôt compute fast enough to motion-blur. Some give it a feeble try, but the feel of the play lessens so dramatically that gamers turn it off and suffer the judder instead. But Moore‚Äôs Law still applies, and soon‚Äîfive years? ten?‚Äîeven videogames will motion-blur properly and fully enter the modern world.</p><p>Best of all, motion blur is just one example of a potent general explanation called the sampling theorem. The theorem works when the samples are frames, taken regularly in time to make a movie, or when they‚Äôre pixels, taken regularly in space to make an image. It works for digital audio, too. In a nutshell, the explanation of smooth motion from unsmooth movies expands to explain the modern media world‚Äîwhy it‚Äôs even possible. But that would take a longer explanation.</p><p>WOULD YOU LIKE BLUE CHEESE WITH IT?</p><p>ALBERT-L√ÅSZL√ì BARAB√ÅSI</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_141.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_143.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
