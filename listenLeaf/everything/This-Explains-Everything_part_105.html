Like all good explanations, it spawns more explanations and further insights. It‚Äôs another example of how we use the interaction of sensory information to understand and respond to the world around us. So the fact that we all think lemons are fast may be a big part of the reason we‚Äôre so smart.</p><p>FALLING INTO PLACE: ENTROPY AND THE DESPERATE INGENUITY OF LIFE</p><p>JOHN TOOBY</p><p>Founder of evolutionary psychology; codirector, University of California‚ÄìSanta Barbara Center for Evolutionary Psychology</p><p>The hardest choice I had to make in my early scientific life was whether to give up the beautiful puzzles of quantum mechanics, nonlocality, and cosmology for something equally arresting: to work instead on reverse-engineering the code that natural selection built into the programs that make up our species‚Äô circuit architecture. In 1970, the surrounding cultural frenzy and geopolitics made first steps toward a nonideological and computational understanding of our evolved design, ‚Äúhuman nature,‚Äù seem urgent. The recent rise of computer science and cybernetics made it seem possible. The almost complete avoidance of, and hostility to, evolutionary biology by behavioral and social scientists that had nearly neutered those fields made it seem necessary.</p><p>What finally pulled me over was that the theory of natural selection was itself such an extraordinarily beautiful and elegant inference engine. Wearing its theoretical lenses was a permanent revelation, populating the mind with chains of deductions that raced like crystal lattices through supersaturated solutions. Even better, it starts from first principles (such as set theory and physics), so much of it is non-optional.</p><p>But still, from the vantage point of physics, beneath natural selection there remained a deep problem in search of an explanation: The world given to us by physics is unrelievedly bleak. It blasts us when it is not burning us or invisibly grinding our cells and macromolecules until we are dead. It wipes out planets, habitats, labors, those we love, ourselves. Gamma-ray bursts wipe out entire galactic regions; supernovae, asteroid impacts, supervolcanos, and ice ages devastate ecosystems and end species. Epidemics, strokes, blunt-force trauma, oxidative damage, protein cross-linking, thermal-noise-scrambled DNA‚Äîall are random movements away from the narrowly organized set of states that we value, into increasing disorder. The second law of thermodynamics is the recognition that physical systems tend to move toward more probable states, and in so doing tend to move away from less probable states (organization) on their blind toboggan ride toward maximum disorder.</p><p>Entropy, then, poses the problem: How are living things at all compatible with a physical world governed by entropy, and, given entropy, how can natural selection lead, over the long run, to the increasing accumulation of functional organization in living things? Living things stand out as an extraordinary departure from the physically normal (for example, the Earth‚Äôs metal core, lunar craters, or the solar wind). What sets all organisms‚Äîfrom blackthorn and alder to egrets and otters‚Äîapart from everything else in the universe is that woven through their designs are staggeringly unlikely arrays of finely tuned interrelationships‚Äîa high order that is highly functional. Yet as highly ordered physical systems, organisms should tend to slide rapidly back toward a state of maximum disorder or maximum probability. As the physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger put it, ‚ÄúIt is by avoiding the rapid decay into the inert state of ‚Äòequilibrium‚Äô that an organism appears so enigmatic.‚Äù*</p><p>The quick answer, normally palmed off on creationists, is true as far as it goes, but far from complete: The Earth is not a closed system; organisms are not closed systems, so entropy still increases globally (consistent with the second law of thermodynamics) while (sometimes) decreasing locally in organisms. This permits, but does not explain, the high levels of organization found in life. Natural selection, however, can (correctly) be invoked to explain order in organisms, including the entropy-delaying adaptations that keep us from oxidizing immediately into a puff of ash.</p><p>Natural selection is the only known counterweight to the tendency of physical systems to lose rather than grow functional organization‚Äîthe only natural physical process that pushes populations of organisms uphill (sometimes) into higher degrees of functional order. But how could this work, exactly?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_104.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_106.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
