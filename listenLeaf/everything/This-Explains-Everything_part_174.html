I‚Äôve called it the Lucretius underestimation, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that the tallest mountain there is should be equal to the tallest one he has observed. Danny Kahneman has written, using as backup the works of Howard Kunreuther, that ‚Äúprotective actions, whether by individuals or by governments, are usually designed to be adequate to the worst disaster actually experienced. . . . Images of even worse disaster do not come easily to mind.‚Äù* For instance, in Pharaonic Egypt, scribes tracked the high-water mark of the Nile and used it as a worst-case scenario. No economist had tested the obvious: Do extreme events fall according to the past? Alas, back-testing says, ‚ÄúNo, sorry.‚Äù</p><p>The same dangerous recklessness can be seen in the methodology used for the Fukushima nuclear reactor, built to the worst past outcome and not imagining and extrapolating to much worse. Well, nature, unlike risk engineers, prepares for what has not happened before, assuming worse harm is possible.</p><p>So if humans fight the last war, nature fights the next war. Of course, there is a biological limit to our overcompensation.</p><p>This form of redundancy remains vastly more extrapolative than our minds, which are intrapolative.</p><p>The great Benoit Mandelbrot, now gone for two years, saw the same fractal self-similarity in nature and in probabilities of historical and economic events. It is thrilling to see how the two domains unite under the notion of fractal-based redundancy.</p><p>P.S.: The word ‚Äúfitness‚Äù in the common scientific discourse does not appear to be precise enough. I am unable to figure out if what is called ‚ÄúDarwinian fitness‚Äù is merely intrapolative adaptation to the current environment or if it contains an element of statistical extrapolation. In other words, there is a significant difference between robustness (is not harmed by stressors) and what I‚Äôve called antifragility (i.e., gains from stressors).</p><p>THE BEAUTIFUL LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</p><p>ROBERT KURZBAN</p><p>Associate professor of evolutionary psychology, University of Pennsylvania; director, Pennsylvania Laboratory for Experimental Evolutionary Psychology (PLEEP); author, Why Everyone (Else) is a Hypocrite</p><p>According to the guide on my walking tour of The Rocks neighborhood in Sydney, Australia, when the plague hit the city around 1900 a bounty was placed on rats to encourage people to kill them, since it was known that rats bore the fleas that communicated the disease to humans. The intent of the bounty was plain enough: reducing the number of rats to reduce the spread of the plague. An unintended consequence, however, was that residents, tempted by the rat bounty, began breeding rats.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_173.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_175.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
