(Scientists‚Äô actual best estimate for (4) is that roughly 100 billion human beings have ever lived in all of human history; I‚Äôm bumping this up to a trillion just to be safe.)</p><p>All four assumptions are designed to be as uncontroversial as possible; and even then, a few exceptions to the first two assumptions and an even larger estimate in the fourth would only necessitate some minor tweaking to the argument.</p><p>Now, back to you and your ancestors. Let‚Äôs start by building your family tree going back 40 generations: you, your parents, their parents, and so on, 40 steps back. Since each generation lasts, at most, 100 years, the last 40 generations of your family tree all take place within the past 4,000 years. (In fact, they almost surely take place within just the past 1,000 or 1,200 years, but remember that we‚Äôre trying to be uncontroversial.)</p><p>We can view a drawing of your family tree as a kind of ‚Äúorg chart,‚Äù listing a set of jobs or roles that need to be filled by people. That is, someone needs to be your mother, someone needs to be your father, someone needs to be your mother‚Äôs father, and so forth, going back up the tree. We‚Äôll call each of these an ‚Äúancestor role‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs a job that exists in your ancestry, and we can talk about this job regardless of who actually filled it. The first generation back in your family tree contains two ancestor roles, for your two parents. The second contains four ancestor roles, for your grandparents; the third contains eight roles, for your great-grandparents. Each level you go back doubles the number of ancestor roles that need to be filled, so if you work out the arithmetic, you‚Äôll find that forty generations in the past you have more than a trillion ancestor roles that need to be filled.</p><p>At this point, it‚Äôs time for the pigeonhole principle to make its appearance. The most recent 40 generations of your family tree all took place within the past 4,000 years, and we decided that, at most, a trillion people lived during this time. So there are more ancestor roles (over a trillion) than there are people to fill these roles (at most a trillion). This brings us to the crucial point: At least two roles in your ancestry must have been filled by the same person. Let‚Äôs call this person A.</p><p>Now that we‚Äôve identified A, we‚Äôre basically done. Starting from two different roles that A filled in your ancestry, let‚Äôs walk back down the family tree toward you. These two walks downward from A have to first meet each other at some ancestor role lower down in the tree, filled by a person B. Since the two walks are meeting for the first time at B, one walk arrived via B‚Äôs mother and the other arrived via B‚Äôs father. In other words, A is an ancestor of B‚Äôs mother and also an ancestor of B‚Äôs father, just as we wanted to conclude.</p><p>Once you step back and absorb how the argument works, you can appreciate a few things. First, in a way it‚Äôs more a fact about simple mathematical structures than it is about people. We‚Äôre taking a giant family tree‚Äîyours‚Äîand trying to stuff it into the past 4,000 years of human history. It‚Äôs too big to fit, so certain people have to occupy more than one position in it.</p><p>Second, the argument has what mathematicians like to call a nonconstructive aspect. It never really gave you a recipe for finding A and B in your family tree; it convinced you that they must be there, but very little more.</p><p>And finally, I like to think of it as a typical episode in the lives of the pigeonhole principle and all the other quietly powerful statements that dot the mathematical landscape‚Äîa band of understated little facts that seem frequently to show up at just the right time and, without any visible effort, clean up an otherwise messy situation.</p><p>WHY PROGRAMS HAVE BUGS</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_118.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_120.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
