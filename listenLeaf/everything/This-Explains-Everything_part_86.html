His achievements in India speak for themselves. But even if Gandhi had not contributed vital energy and leadership to his own country, he had enormous influence on peaceful resisters across the globe: Nelson Mandela in South Africa, Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States, and the solitary figures in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and Tahrir Square in 2011.</p><p>Despite the laudatory efforts of scientists to ferret out patterns in human behavior, I continue to be struck by the impact of single individuals, or of small groups, working against the odds. As scholars, we cannot and should not sweep these instances under the investigative rug. We should bear in mind anthropologist Margaret Mead‚Äôs famous injunction: ‚ÄúNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.‚Äù</p><p>SUBJECTIVE ENVIRONMENT</p><p>ANDRIAN KREYE</p><p>Editor, The Feuilleton (arts and essays) of the German daily S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Munich</p><p>Explanations tend to be at their most elegant when science distills the meanderings of philosophy into fact. I was looking for explanations for an observation when I came across the theory of Umwelt vs. Umfeld (loosely, ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù vs. ‚Äúsurroundings‚Äù) by the Estonian biologist and founding father of biosemiotics Jakob von Uexk√ºll. According to his definition, Umwelt is the subjective environment, as perceived and acted on by an organism, whereas Umfeld is the objective environment, which encompasses and acts on all organisms within it.</p><p>My observation had been a mere notion of the major difference between my native Europe and America, my adopted continent for a couple of decades. In Europe, the present is perceived as the endpoint of history. In America, the present is perceived as the beginning of the future. Philosophy or history, I hoped, would have an explanation for such a fundamental yet simple difference. Both can deliver parts of an explanation, of course. The different paths the histories of ideas and the histories of the countries have taken just in the past 200 years are astounding.</p><p>Uexk√ºll‚Äôs definition of the subjective environment as published in his book Umwelt und Innnenwelt der Tiere (Environments and Inner Worlds of Animals, published in 1909 in the language of his German exile) puts both philosophy and history into perspective and context. Distrusting theories, he wanted ideas to persist in nature, putting his notion of the subjective environment to the test in the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean. He observed simple creatures like sea anemones, sea urchins, and crustaceans, but the famous example illustrating his theory was the tick. Here he found a creature whose perception and actions could be defined by three parameters. Ticks perceive their surroundings by the directions of up and down, by warm and cold, and by the presence or absence of butyric acid. Their actions to survive and procreate are crawling, waiting, and gripping.</p><p>This model led him to define not just environment but also time as a subjective notion. He found any organism‚Äôs perception of time as subjective as its perception of space, and defined by the very perceptions and actions that create the organism‚Äôs subjective environment.</p><p>If subjective time is defined by the experiences and actions of an organism, the context of a continent‚Äôs history, with its myriads of parameters, turns philosophy and history into mere factors in a complex environment of collective perception. Now, here was an elegant explanation for a rather simple observation. Making it even more elegant is the notion that in the context of a continent‚Äôs evolution, such factors as geography, climate, food, and culture will figure in the perception of both the subjective environment and the subjective time, making it impossible to prove or disprove the explanation scientifically. Having rendered philosophy to just one of many parameters, it thus reduces its efforts to discredit Jakob von Uexk√ºll‚Äôs definition of the subjective environment to mere meanderings.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_85.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_87.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
