But what did he know? Keats was a poet, not a scientist. In the world that scientists inhabit, truth is not always beautiful or elegant, though it may be deep. In fact, it‚Äôs my impression that the deeper an explanation goes, the less likely it is to be beautiful or elegant.</p><p>In 1938, the psychologist B. F. Skinner proposed an elegant explanation of ‚Äúthe behavior of organisms‚Äù (the title of his first book), based on the idea that rewarding a response‚Äîhe called it reinforcement‚Äîincreases the probability that the same response will occur in the future. The theory failed, not because it was false (reinforcement generally does increase the probability of a response) but because it was too simple. It ignored innate components of behavior. It couldn‚Äôt even handle all learned behavior. Much behavior is acquired or shaped through experience, but not necessarily by means of reinforcement. Organisms learn various things in various ways.</p><p>The theory of the modular mind is another way of explaining behavior‚Äîin particular, human behavior. The idea is that the human mind is made up of a number of specialized components called modules that work more or less independently. These modules collect various kinds of information from the environment and process it in different ways. They issue different commands‚Äîoccasionally, conflicting commands. It‚Äôs not an elegant theory; on the contrary, it‚Äôs the sort of thing that would make Occam whip out his razor. But we shouldn‚Äôt judge theories by asking them to compete in a beauty pageant. We should ask whether they can explain more, or explain better, than previous theories could. The modular theory can explain, for example, the curious effects of brain injuries. Some abilities may be lost while others are spared, with the pattern differing from one patient to another.</p><p>More to the point, the modular theory can explain some of the puzzles of everyday life. Consider intergroup conflict. The Montagues and the Capulets hated each other; yet Romeo (a Montague) fell in love with Juliet (a Capulet). How can you love a member of a group yet go on hating that group? The answer is that two separate mental modules are involved. One deals with groupness (identification with one‚Äôs group and hostility toward other groups), the other specializes in personal relationships. Both modules collect information about people, but they do different things with the data. The groupness module draws category lines and computes averages within categories; the result is called a stereotype. The relationship module collects and stores detailed information about specific individuals. It takes pleasure in collecting this information, which is why we love to gossip, read novels and biographies, and watch political candidates unravel on our TV screens. No one has to give us food or money to get us to do these things, or even administer a pat on the back, because collecting the data is its own reward.</p><p>The theory of the modular mind is not beautiful or elegant. But not being a poet, I prize truth above beauty.</p><p>ERATOSTHENES AND THE MODULAR MIND</p><p>DAN SPERBER</p><p>Social and cognitive scientist; director, International Cognition and Culture Institute; coauthor (with Deirdre Wilson), Meaning and Relevance</p><p>Eratosthenes (276‚Äì195 B.C.), the head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt, made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, astronomy, geography, and history. He also argued against dividing humankind into Greeks and ‚ÄúBarbarians.‚Äù What he is remembered for, however, is having provided the first correct measurement of the circumference of the Earth (a story well told in Nicholas Nicastro‚Äôs recent book, Circumference). How did he do it?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_73.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_75.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
