As Heisenberg observed: “Causality law has it that if we know the present, then we can predict the future. Be aware: In this formulation, it is not the consequence but the premise that is false. As a matter of principle, we cannot know all determining elements of the present.”</p><p>Inexactness questions methodology. Experiments can prove only what they are designed to prove. Inexactness is a theory based on the practical constraints of measurement.</p><p>Inexactness and quantum mechanics challenge faith as well as concepts of truth and order. They imply a probabilistic world of matter, where we cannot know anything with certainty but only as a possibility. It removes the Newtonian elements of space and time from any underlying reality. In the quantum world, mechanics are understood as a probability without any causal explanation.</p><p>Albert Einstein refused to accept that positions in spacetime could never be completely known and quantum probabilities did not reflect any underlying causes. He did not reject the theory but the lack of reason for an event. Writing to Max Born, he famously stated, “I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice.” But as Stephen Hawking later remarked, in terms that Heisenberg would have recognized, “Not only does God play dice, but . . . he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.”</p><p>Allusive and subtle, the power of inexactness draws on its metaphorical property, which has allowed it to penetrate diverse fields, such as art theory, financial economics, and even popular culture.At one level, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is taken to mean that the act of measuring something changes what is observed. But at another level, intentionally or unintentionally, Heisenberg is saying something about the nature of the entire system—the absence of absolute truths and the limits to our knowledge.</p><p>Inexactness is linked with various philosophical constructs. Søren Kierkegaard differentiated between objective truths and subjective truths. Objective truths are filtered and altered by our subjective truths, recalling the interaction between observer and event central to Heisenberg’s theorem.</p><p>Inexactness is related to linguistic philosophies. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein anticipates inexactness, arguing that the structure of language provides the limits of thought and what can be said meaningfully.</p><p>The deep ambiguity of inexactness manifests itself in other ways: the controversy over Heisenberg’s personal history. In 1941, during the Second World War, Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, his former teacher, met in occupied Denmark. In Michael Frayn’s 1998 play Copenhagen, Margrethe, Bohr’s wife, poses the essential question, which is debated in the play: “Why did he [Heisenberg] come to Copenhagen?” The play repeats their meeting three times, each with different outcomes. As Heisenberg, the character, states: “No one understands my trip to Copenhagen. Time and time again I’ve explained it. To Bohr himself, and Margrethe. To interrogators and intelligence officers, to journalists and historians. The more I’ve explained, the deeper the uncertainty has become.”</p><p>In his 1930 text The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Paul Dirac contrasted the Newtonian world and the quantum one: “It has become increasingly evident . . . that nature works on a different plan. Her fundamental laws do not govern the world as it appears in our mental picture in any direct way, but instead they control a substratum of which we cannot form a mental picture without introducing irrelevancies.”</p><p>There was a world before Heisenberg and his uncertainty principle. There is a world after Heisenberg. They are the same world, but they are different.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_62.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_64.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
