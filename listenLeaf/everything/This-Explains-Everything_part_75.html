This meant that the sun was then at the zenith. For that, Syene had to be on the Tropic of Cancer and the day had to be the summer solstice (our June 21). He knew how long it took caravans to travel from Alexandria to Syene and, on that basis, estimated the distance between the two cities to be 5,014 stades. He assumed that Syene was due south on the same meridian as Alexandria. Actually, in this he was slightly mistaken‚ÄîSyene is somewhat to the east of Alexandria‚Äîand also in assuming that Syene was right on the Tropic. But, serendipitously, the effect of these two mistakes canceled each other out. He understood that the sun was far enough away to treat as parallel the rays of the sun that reach the Earth. When the sun was at the zenith in Syene, it had to be south of the zenith in the more northern Alexandria. By how much? He measured the length of the shadow cast by an obelisk located in front of the Library (says the story‚Äîor cast by some other, more convenient vertical object), and‚Äîeven without trigonometry that had yet to be developed‚Äîhe could determine that the sun was at an angle of 7.2Àö south of the zenith. That very angle, he understood, measured the curvature of the Earth between Alexandria and Syene (see the figure). Since 7.2Àö is a fiftieth of 360Àö, Eratosthenes could then, by multiplying the distance between Alexandria and Syene by 50, calculate the circumference of the Earth. The result, 252,000 stades, is 1 percent shy of the modern measurement of 40,008 km.</p><p>Eratosthenes brought together apparently unrelated pieces of evidence (the pace of caravans, the sun shining to the bottom of a well, the length of the shadow of an obelisk), assumptions (the sphericity of the Earth, its distance from the sun), and mathematical tools to measure a circumference he could neither see nor survey but only imagine. His result is simple and compelling. The way he reached it epitomizes human intelligence at its best.</p><p>Jerry Fodor (whose contribution to modern philosophy of mind is second to none) might well use this intellectual prowess as a perfect illustration of the way the central systems of our mind operate. They are, he claims, ‚Äúisotropic,‚Äù in the sense that any belief or evidence is relevant to the evaluation of any new hypothesis, and ‚ÄúQuinean‚Äù (after the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine), in the sense that all our beliefs are part of a single integrated system. This contrasts with the view (which I have contributed to developing) that the mind is wholly made up of specialized ‚Äúmodules,‚Äù each attending to a specific cognitive domain or task, and that our mental activity results from the complex interactions (complementarities, competitions . . . ) among these modules. Doesn‚Äôt, however, the story of Eratosthenes prove that Fodor‚Äôs view is right? How could a massively modular mind ever have achieved such a feat?</p><p>Here‚Äôs an answer. Some of our modules are metarepresentational. They specialize in processing different kinds of representations: mental representations for mind-reading modules; linguistic representations for communication modules; abstract representations for reasoning modules. These metarepresentational modules are highly specialized. After all, representations are very special objects, found only in information-processing devices such as people and in their output. Representations have original properties‚Äîtruth-or-falsity, consistency, and so on‚Äîwhich are not found in any other objects. Given, however, that the representations these metarepresentational modules process may themselves be about just anything, they provide a kind of virtual domain-generality. Hence the illusion that metarepresentational thinking is truly general and nonspecialized.</p><p>Eratosthenes, I am suggesting, was not thinking concretely about the circumference of the Earth (in the way he might have been thinking concretely about the distance from the Library to the Palace in Alexandria). Rather, he was thinking about a challenge posed by the quite different estimates of the circumference of the Earth that had been offered by other scholars at the time. He was thinking about various mathematical principles and tools that could be brought to bear on the issue. He was thinking of the evidential use that could be made of sundry observations and reports. He was aiming at finding a clear and compelling solution, a convincing argument. In other terms, he was thinking about objects of a single kind‚Äîrepresentations‚Äîand looking for a new way to put them together. In doing so, he was inspired by others and aiming at others. His intellectual feat makes sense only as a particularly remarkable link in a social-cultural chain of mental and communicational events. To me, it is a stunning illustration not of the solitary functioning of the individual mind but of the powers of socially and culturally extended modular minds.</p><p>DAN SPERBER‚ÄôS EXPLANATION OF CULTURE</p><p>CLAY SHIRKY</p><p>Social media researcher; arts professor, NYU Tisch School of the Arts‚Äô Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP); author, Cognitive Surplus: How Technology Makes Consumers into Collaborators</p><p>Why do members of a group of people behave the same way? Why do they behave differently from other groups living nearby? Why are those behaviors so stable over time? Alas, the obvious answer‚Äîcultures are adaptations to their environments‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt hold up. Multiple adjacent cultures along the Indus, the Euphrates, the Upper Rhine have differed in language, dress, and custom, despite existing side-by-side in almost identical environments.</p><p>Something happens to keep one group of people behaving in a certain set of ways. In the early 1970s, both E. O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins noticed that the flow of ideas in a culture exhibited similar patterns to the flow of genes in a species‚Äîhigh flow within the group but sharply reduced flow between groups. Dawkins‚Äô response was to assume a hypothetical unit of culture called the meme, though he also made its problems clear: With genetic material, perfect replication is the norm and mutations rare. With culture, it is the opposite; events are misremembered and then misdescribed, quotes are mangled, even jokes (pure meme) vary from telling to telling. The gene/meme comparison remained, for a generation, an evocative idea of not much analytic utility.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_74.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_76.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
