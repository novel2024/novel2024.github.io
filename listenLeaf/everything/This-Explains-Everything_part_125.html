In it, he predicted that the number of components on a single integrated circuit would rise from the then-current number of roughly 26 to roughly 216 in the following ten years‚Äîthat is, the number of components would double every year. He based this prediction on four empirical data points and one null data point, fitting a straight line on a graph plotting the log of the number of components on a single chip against a linear scale of calendar years. Intel later amended Moore‚Äôs Law to say that ‚Äúthe number of transistors on a chip roughly doubles every two years.‚Äù</p><p>Moore‚Äôs Law is rightly seen as the fundamental driver of the information technology revolution in our world over the last fifty years. Doubling the number of transistors every so often has made our computers twice as powerful for the same price, doubled the amount of data they can store or display, made them twice as fast, made them smaller, made them cheaper, and in general improved them in every possible way by a factor of 2 on a clockwork schedule.</p><p>But why does it happen? Automobiles have not obeyed Moore‚Äôs Law; neither have batteries, nor clothing, nor food production, nor the level of political discourse. All but the last have demonstrably improved due to the influence of Moore‚Äôs Law, but none has had the same relentless exponential improvements.</p><p>The most elegant explanation for what makes Moore‚Äôs Law possible is that digital logic is all about an abstraction‚Äîand, in fact, a one-bit abstraction, a yes/no answer to a question‚Äîand that abstraction is independent of physical bulk.</p><p>In a world that consists entirely of piles of red sand and piles of green sand, the size of the piles is irrelevant. A pile is either red or green, and you can take away half the pile, and it‚Äôs still either a pile of red sand or a pile of green sand. And you can take away another half, and another half, and so on, and still the abstraction is maintained. And repeated halving at a constant rate makes an exponential.</p><p>That‚Äôs why Moore‚Äôs Law works for digital technology and doesn‚Äôt work for technologies that require physical strength, or physical bulk, or must deliver certain amounts of energy. Digital technology uses physics to maintain an abstraction and nothing more.</p><p>Some caveats do apply:</p><p>In his short paper, Moore expressed some doubt as to whether his prediction would hold for linear, rather than digital, integrated circuits, pointing out that by their nature ‚Äúsuch elements require the storage of energy in a volume‚Äù and that the volume would necessarily be large.</p><p>It does matter when you get down to piles of sand with just one grain, and then technology has to shift and you need to use some new physical property to define the abstraction. Such technology shifts have happened again and again in the maintenance of Moore‚Äôs Law over almost fifty years.</p><p>The idea does not explain the sociology of how Moore‚Äôs Law is implemented or what determines the time constant of a doubling, but it does explain why exponentials are possible in this domain.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_124.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_126.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
