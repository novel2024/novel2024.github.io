We take it as a given that people vary in the manifold ways described above (and others), but we cope with this variance by randomly assigning people to either drink red wine or not. If people who eat doughnuts and never exercise are equally likely to be in the ‚Äúwine treatment‚Äù or the ‚Äúcontrol treatment,‚Äù then we can do a decent job of assessing the average impact of red wine over and above the likely impact of other factors. It sounds simple because, well, it is‚Äîbut anytime a simple technique yields so much, ‚Äúelegant‚Äù is a more apt description.</p><p>The rise of experiments in the social sciences beginning in the 1950s‚Äîincluding Meier‚Äôs contributions‚Äîhas exploded in recent years with the adoption of randomized experiments in fields ranging from medicine (testing interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy) to political science (running voter-turnout experiments) to education (assigning kids to be paid for grades) to economics (encouraging savings behavior). The experimental method has also begun to filter into and impact public policy: President Obama appointed behavioral economist Cass Sunstein to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and Prime Minister David Cameron instituted a Behavioural Insights Team.</p><p>Randomized experiments are by no means a perfect tool for explanation. Some important questions simply do not lend themselves to randomized experiments, and the method in the wrong hands can cause harm, as in the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment. But their increasingly widespread application speaks to their flexibility in informing us how things work and why they work that way.</p><p>THE UNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM</p><p>LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS</p><p>Physicist/cosmologist, Arizona State University; author, A Universe from Nothing</p><p>No explanation I know of in recent scientific history is as beautiful or deep, or ultimately as elegant, as the 19th-century explanation of the remarkable connection between two familiar but seemingly distinct forces in nature‚Äîelectricity and magnetism. It represents to me all that is best about science: It combined surprising empirical discoveries with a convoluted path to a remarkably simple and elegant mathematical framework, which explained far more than was ever bargained for and in the process produced the technology that powers modern civilization.</p><p>Strange experiments with jumping frogs and electric circuits eventually led to the serendipitous discovery, by the self-schooled yet greatest experimentalist of his time, Michael Faraday, of a strange connection between magnets and electric currents. By then, it was well known that a moving electric charge (or current) created a magnetic field around itself that could repel or attract other nearby magnets. What remained an open question was whether magnets could produce any electric force on charged objects. Faraday discovered, by accident, that when he turned a switch on or off to start or stop a current, creating a magnetic field that grew or decreased with time, during the periods when the magnetic field was changing, a force would suddenly arise in a nearby wire, moving the electric charges within it to create a current.</p><p>Faraday‚Äôs law of induction, as it became known, not only is responsible for the basic principle governing all electric generators from Niagara Falls to nuclear power plants but also produced a theoretical conundrum that required the mind of the greatest theoretical physicist of his time, James Clerk Maxwell, to set things straight. Maxwell realized that Faraday‚Äôs result implied that it was the changing magnetic field (a pictorial concept introduced by Faraday himself because he felt more comfortable with pictures than algebra) that produced an electric field that pushed the charges around the wire, thereby creating a current.</p><p>Achieving mathematical symmetry in the equations governing electric and magnetic fields then required that a changing electric field and not merely moving charges would produce a magnetic field. This not only produced a set of mathematically consistent equations every physics student knows (and some love) called Maxwell‚Äôs equations, which can fit on a T-shirt, but it established the physical reality of what was otherwise a figment of Faraday‚Äôs imagination: a field‚Äîthat is, some quantity associated with every point in space and time.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_166.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_168.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
