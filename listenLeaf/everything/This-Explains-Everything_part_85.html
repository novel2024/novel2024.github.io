Diamond attempts to answer an enormously complex and historically controversial question‚Äîwhy certain societies achieved historical dominance over others‚Äîby appealing to a set of basic differences in the physical environments from which these societies emerged, such as differences in the availability of plants and animals suitable for domestication.</p><p>These differences, Diamond argues, gave rise to a number of specific advantages, such as greater immunity to disease, that were directly responsible for the historical success of some societies. I‚Äôm not an expert in this domain, so I realize that Diamond‚Äôs explanation might well be misguided‚Äîyet the appeal to such basic mechanisms in order to explain such a wide set of complex observations is so deeply satisfying that I hope he‚Äôs right.</p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUALS</p><p>HOWARD GARDNER</p><p>Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education; author, Truth, Beauty, and Goodness Reframed: Educating for the Virtues in the 21st Century</p><p>I consider myself a scientist, and the theory of evolution is central to my thinking. I am a social scientist and have been informed by insights from many social sciences, including economics. Yet I have little sympathy with hegemonic attempts to explain all human behaviors via evolutionary psychology, via rational-choice economics, and/or by a combination of these two frameworks.</p><p>In a planet occupied now by nearly 7 billion inhabitants, I am amazed by the difference one human being can make. Think of classical music without Mozart or Stravinsky; of painting without Caravaggio, Picasso, or Pollock; of drama without Shakespeare or Beckett. Think of the incredible contributions of Michelangelo or Leonardo, or, in recent times, the outpouring of deep feeling at the death of Steve Jobs (or, for that matter, Michael Jackson or Princess Diana). Think of human values in the absence of Moses or Christ.</p><p>Alas, not all singular individuals make a positive difference. The history of the 20th century would be far happier had it not been for Hitler, Stalin, or Mao (or the 21st century without Bin Laden). But in reaction to these individuals, there sometimes arise more praiseworthy figures: Konrad Adenauer in Germany, Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping in China. These successors also make a signal difference.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_84.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_86.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
