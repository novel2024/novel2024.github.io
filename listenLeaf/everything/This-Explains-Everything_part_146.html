The power of the scientific method lies in the extraordinary richness of understanding that can emerge from an attempt to devise a new explanation. It‚Äôs like an inverted pyramid, with the first observation‚Äîoften just a slight departure from the norm‚Äîas the point and then ever widening layers of inference, each dependent on a lower layer, until the whole pyramid supplies a satisfying and conclusive explanatory whole.</p><p>One of my favorite such explanations dates from 1972, with the observation of a small anomaly in a routine sample of uranium ore from Oklo, a region in the Haut-Ogoou√© Province of the Central African state of Gabon, which was analyzed in a French laboratory. Rock samples of naturally occurring uranium usually contain two types of uranium atoms, the isotopes U-238 and U-235. Most of the atoms are U-238, but about 0.7 percent are U-235. In fact, to be accurate, the figure is 0.72 percent, but the sample that arrived in France had ‚Äúonly‚Äù 0.717 percent, meaning that .003 percent of the expected U-235 atoms were missing.</p><p>Such differences in proportion were known to occur only in the artificial surroundings of a nuclear reactor, where U-235 is bombarded with neutrons in a chain reaction that transforms the atoms and leads to the change in the naturally occurring proportions. But this sample had come from a mine in Gabon, and at the time there was no nuclear reactor on the whole continent of Africa, so that couldn‚Äôt be the explanation. Or could it?</p><p>Nearly twenty years earlier, scientists had suggested that somewhere on Earth the conditions might once have existed for a uranium deposit to act like a natural nuclear-fission reactor. They proposed three necessary conditions:</p><p>The size of the deposit should be greater than the average length that fission-inducing neutrons travel, which is about 70 centimeters.</p><p>U-235 atoms must be present in a greater abundance than in natural rocks today, as much as 3 percent instead of 0.72 percent.</p><p>There must be what is called in a nuclear reactor a moderator, a substance that ‚Äúblankets‚Äù the emitted neutrons and slows them down so they‚Äôre more apt to induce fission.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_145.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_147.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
