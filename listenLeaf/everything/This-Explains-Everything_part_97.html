I like its beautiful simplicity, the way it illuminates dark corners of misreading, how it highlights the counterconventional. Poking about in the dirt is exciting, and irreverent. It‚Äôs about taking what‚Äôs out of bounds and making it relevant. Douglas‚Äôs explanation of ‚Äúdirt‚Äù makes us question the very boundaries we‚Äôre pushing.</p><p>INFORMATION IS THE RESOLUTION OF UNCERTAINTY</p><p>ANDREW LIH</p><p>Associate professor of journalism, University of Southern California; author, The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World‚Äôs Greatest Encyclopedia</p><p>Nearly everything we enjoy in the digital age hinges on this one idea, yet few people are aware of its originator or the foundations of this simple, elegant theory of information. How many know that the information age was not the creation of Bill Gates or Steve Jobs but of Claude Shannon in 1948? Shannon was a humble man and an intellectual wanderer who shunned public speaking and granting interviews. This brilliant mathematician, geneticist, and cryptanalyst formulated what would become information theory in the aftermath of World War II, when it was apparent that the war had not been just a war of steel and bullets.</p><p>If World War I was the first mechanized war, the Second World War could be considered the first struggle based around communication technologies. Unlike previous conflicts, there was heavy utilization of radio communication among military forces. This rapid remote coordination pushed the war to all corners of the globe. The field of cryptography advanced quickly, in order to keep messages secret and hidden from adversaries. Also, for the first time in combat, radar was used to detect and track aircraft, thereby surpassing conventional visual capabilities that ended on the horizon.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_96.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_98.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
