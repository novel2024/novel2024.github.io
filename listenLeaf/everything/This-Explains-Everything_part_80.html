There‚Äôs no better way, for example, to show the different modes of evolution of a remote oceanic island and a continental jungle. The jungle is dense and rugged, with steep peaks and valleys, isolating countless species on their tiny peaks of high specialization. The island, with its few species, is like a rolling landscape of gentle hills with species casually wandering over them, evolving into a whole array of Darwin‚Äôs finches, say. The island creatures and plants ‚Äúlazily‚Äù become defenseless against invaders from the mainland.</p><p>You realize that the landscape for each species consists almost entirely of other species, all of them busy evolving right back. That‚Äôs coevolution. We are all each other‚Äôs fitness landscapes.</p><p>ON OCEANS AND AIRPORT SECURITY</p><p>KEVIN P. HAND</p><p>Planetary scientist and astrobiologist; deputy chief scientist, Solar System Exploration, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology</p><p>It may sound odd, but much as I loathe airport security lines, I must admit that while I‚Äôm standing there, stripped down and denuded of metal, waiting to go through the doorway, part of my mind wanders to oceans that likely exist on distant worlds in our solar system.</p><p>These oceans are sheltered beneath the icy shells that cover worlds like Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto (moons of Jupiter), and Enceladus and Titan (moons of Saturn). The oceans within these worlds are liquid water, just as we know and love it here on Earth, and they have probably existed for much of the history of the solar system (about 4.6 billion years). The total volume of liquid water contained in them is at least twenty times that found on Earth. From the standpoint of our search for life beyond Earth, these oceans are prime real estate for a second origin of life and the evolution of extraterrestrial ecosystems.</p><p>But how do we know they exist? The moons are covered in ice, and we can‚Äôt just look down with a spacecraft and see liquid water. That‚Äôs where airport security comes into play. When you walk through an airport-security portal, you‚Äôre walking through a rapidly changing magnetic field. The laws of physics dictate that if you put a conducting material in a changing magnetic field, electric currents will arise, and those electric currents will create a secondary magnetic field. This secondary field is often referred to as the induced magnetic field, because it is induced by the primary field of the portal. Within the portal are detectors that can sense when an induced field is present. When they do, the alarm goes off, and you‚Äôre whisked over to the special search line.</p><p>The same fundamental physics is largely responsible for our knowledge of oceans on some of these distant worlds. Europa provides a good example. Back in the late 1990s, NASA‚Äôs Galileo spacecraft made several flybys of Europa, and the magnetic field sensors on the spacecraft found that Europa does not have a strong internal field of its own. Instead, it has an induced magnetic field, created as a result of Jupiter‚Äôs strong background magnetic field. In other words, the alarm went off.</p><p>But in order for the alarm to go off, there needed to be a conductor. And for Europa, the data indicated that the conducting layer must be near its surface. Other lines of evidence had already shown that the outer 150 kilometers or so of Europa was water, but those datasets could not help distinguish between solid ice and liquid water. For the magnetic-field data, however, ice doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîit‚Äôs not a good conductor. Liquid water with salts dissolved in it, like our own ocean, does work. The best fits to the data indicate that Europa has an outer ice shell about 10 kilometers thick, beneath which lies a global ocean about 100 kilometers deep. Beneath that is a rocky seafloor, which may be teeming with hydrothermal vents and bizarre otherworldly organisms.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_79.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_81.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
