How could you determine the current and future position of enemy aircraft so that you could properly time artillery fire to shoot them down? The radar information about plane position was a breakthrough, but ‚Äúnoisy,‚Äù in that it provided an approximation of location but not precisely enough to be immediately useful. After the war, this inspired Shannon and many others to think about the nature of filtering and propagating information, whether radar signals, voices (on phone calls), or video (for television). Noise was the enemy of communication, so any way to store and transmit information that rejected noise was of particular interest to Shannon‚Äôs employer, Bell Laboratories, the research arm of the mid-century American telephone monopoly.</p><p>Shannon considered communication the most mathematical of the engineering sciences and turned his intellect toward this problem. Having worked on the intricacies of Vannevar Bush‚Äôs differential-analyzer analog computer in his early days at MIT, and with a mathematics-heavy PhD thesis (‚ÄúAn Algebra for Theoretical Genetics‚Äù), Shannon was particularly well suited to understanding the fundamentals of handling information using knowledge from a variety of disciplines. By 1948 he had formed his central, simple, and powerful thesis: Information is the resolution of uncertainty.</p><p>As long as something can be relayed that resolves uncertainty, that is the fundamental nature of information. While this sounds obvious, it was an important point, given the different languages people speak and how one utterance can be meaningful to one person and unintelligible to another. Until Shannon‚Äôs theory was formulated, it was not known how to compensate for these types of ‚Äúpsychological factors‚Äù appropriately. Shannon built on the work of fellow researchers Ralph Hartley and Harry Nyquist to show that coding and symbols were the key to resolving whether two communicators had a common understanding of the uncertainty being resolved.</p><p>Shannon then asked, ‚ÄúWhat is the simplest resolution of uncertainty?‚Äù To him it was the flip of the coin‚Äîheads or tails, yes or no: an event with only two outcomes. He concluded that any type of information could be encoded as a series of yes or no answers. Today we know these answers as bits of digital information, 1s and 0s, which represent everything from e-mail text, digital photos, compact-disk music, or high-definition video. That any and all information could be represented and coded in discrete bits not just approximately but perfectly, without noise or error, was a breakthrough that astonished even his peers at academic institutions and Bell Laboratories, who had despaired of inventing a simple universal theory of information.</p><p>The compact disk, the first ubiquitous digital encoding system for the average consumer, brought Shannon‚Äôs legacy to the masses in 1982. It provides perfect reproduction of sound by dividing each second of musical audio waves into 44,100 slices (samples), and recording the height of each slice in digital numbers (quantization). Higher sampling rates and finer quantization raise the quality of the sound. Converting this digital stream back to audible analog sound using modern circuitry allowed for consistent high fidelity. Similar digital approaches have been used for images and video, so that today we enjoy a universe of MP3, DVDs, HDTV, and AVCHD multimedia files that can be stored, transmitted, and copied with no loss of quality.</p><p>Shannon became a professor at MIT, and over the years his students made many of the major breakthroughs of the information age, including digital modems, computer graphics, data compression, artificial intelligence, and digital wireless communication. Information theory as a novel and previously unimagined discovery has transformed nearly every aspect of our daily lives to digital, from how we work to how we live and socialize. Beautiful, elegant, and deeply powerful!</p><p>EVERYTHING IS THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT GOT THAT WAY</p><p>PZ MYERS</p><p>Associate professor of biology, University of Minnesota Morris; author, Atheist Voices of Minnesota: an Anthology of Personal Stories</p><p>There‚Äôs no denying that the central concept of modern biology is evolution, but I was a victim of the American public school system and I went through twelve years of education without once hearing any mention of the E word. We dissected cats, we memorized globs of taxonomy, we regurgitated extremely elementary fragments of biochemistry on exams, but we were not given any framework to make sense of it all. One reason I care very much about science education now is that mine was so poor.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_97.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_99.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
