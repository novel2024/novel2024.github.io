For me, Hamlet‚Äôs admonition explains the confusion and uncertainty of the universe (and, lately, the multiverse). It urges us on when, as they always will, our philosophies produce anomalies. It answers the unspoken question, ‚ÄúWTF?‚Äù With every door into nature we nudge open, 100 new doors become visible, each with its own inscrutable combination lock. It is both an explanation and a challenge, because there‚Äôs always more to know.</p><p>I like the way it endlessly loops back on itself. Every time you discover a new thing in heaven or earth, it becomes part of your philosophy, which will eventually be challenged by new new things.</p><p>Like all explanations, of course, it has its limits. Hamlet says it to urge Horatio to accept the possibility of ghosts. It could just as well be used to prompt belief in UFOs, astrology, and even God‚Äîas if to say that that something is proved to exist by the very fact that you can‚Äôt disprove it exists.</p><p>Still, the phrase can get us places. Not as a taxi to the end of thinking but as a passport to exploration. These words of Hamlet‚Äôs are best thought of as a ratchet‚Äîa word earthily beautiful in sound and meaning: Keep moving on, but preserve what works. We need Einstein for GPS, but we can still get to the moon with Newton.</p><p>AN UNRESOLVED (AND THEREFORE UNBEAUTIFUL) REACTION TO THE EDGE QUESTION</p><p>REBECCA NEWBERGER GOLDSTEIN</p><p>Philosopher, novelist; Franke Visiting Fellow, Whitney Humanities Center, Yale; author, 36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</p><p>This year‚Äôs Edge Question sits uneasily on a deeper question: Where do we get the idea‚Äîa fantastic idea, if you stop and think about it‚Äîthat the beauty of an explanation has anything to do with the likelihood of its being true? What do beauty and truth have to do with each other? Is there any good explanation of why the central notion of aesthetics (fluffy) should be inserted into the central notion of science (rigorous)?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_40.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_42.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
