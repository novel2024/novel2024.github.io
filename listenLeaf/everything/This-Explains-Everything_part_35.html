Now a very active ninety, Barlow is a member of a distinguished lineage of Cambridge neurobiologists. I want to talk about an idea he published in two papers in 1961, on redundancy reduction and pattern recognition. It‚Äôs an idea whose ramifications and significance have inspired me throughout my career.</p><p>The folklore of neurobiology includes a mythical ‚Äúgrandmother neuron,‚Äù which fires only when a very particular image, the face of Jerry Lettvin‚Äôs grandmother, falls on the retina (Lettvin was a distinguished American neurobiologist who, like Barlow, worked on the frog retina). The point is that Lettvin‚Äôs grandmother is only one of countless images that a brain is capable of recognizing. If there were a specific neuron for everything we can recognize‚Äînot just Lettvin‚Äôs grandmother but lots of other faces, objects, letters of the alphabet, flowers, each one seen from many angles and distances‚Äîwe would have a combinatorial explosion. If sensory recognition worked on the grandmother principle, the number of specific-recognition neurons for all possible combinations of nerve impulses would exceed the number of atoms in the universe. Independently, the American psychologist Fred Attneave had calculated that the volume of the brain would have to be measured in cubic light-years. Barlow and Attneave independently proposed redundancy reduction as the answer.</p><p>Claude Shannon, inventor of information theory, coined ‚Äúredundancy‚Äù as a kind of inverse of information. In English, ‚Äúq‚Äù is always followed by ‚Äúu,‚Äù so the ‚Äúu‚Äù can be omitted without loss of information. It is redundant. Wherever redundancy occurs in a message (which is wherever there is nonrandomness), the message can be more economically recoded without loss of information‚Äîalthough with some loss in capacity to correct errors. Barlow suggested that at every stage in sensory pathways there are mechanisms tuned to eliminate massive redundancy.</p><p>The world at time t is not greatly different from the world at time t-1. Therefore it is not necessary for sensory systems continuously to report the state of the world. They need only signal changes, leaving the brain to assume that everything not reported remains the same. Sensory adaptation is a well-known feature of sensory systems, which does precisely as Barlow prescribed. If a neuron is signaling temperature, for example, the rate of firing is not, as one might naively suppose, proportional to the temperature. Instead, firing rate increases only when there is a change in temperature. It then dies away to a low, resting frequency. The same is true of neurons signaling brightness, loudness, pressure, and so on. Sensory adaptation achieves huge economies by exploiting the nonrandomness in temporal sequence of states of the world.</p><p>What sensory adaptation achieves in the temporal domain, the well-established phenomenon of lateral inhibition does in the spatial domain. If a scene in the world falls on a pixelated screen, such as the back of a digital camera or the retina of an eye, most pixels seem the same as their immediate neighbors. The exceptions are those pixels which lie on edges, boundaries. If every retinal cell faithfully reported its light value to the brain, the brain would be bombarded with a hugely redundant message. Great economies can be achieved if most of the impulses reaching the brain come from pixel cells lying along edges in the scene. The brain then assumes uniformity in the spaces between edges.</p><p>As Barlow pointed out, this is exactly what lateral inhibition achieves. In the frog retina, for example, every ganglion cell sends signals to the brain, reporting on the light intensity in its particular location on the surface of the retina. But it simultaneously sends inhibitory signals to its immediate neighbors. This means that the only ganglion cells to send strong signals to the brain are those that lie on an edge. Ganglion cells lying in uniform fields of color (the majority) send few if any impulses to the brain, because they, unlike cells on edges, are inhibited by all their neighbors. The spatial redundancy in the signal is eliminated.</p><p>The Barlow analysis can be extended to most of what is now known about sensory neurobiology, including Hubel and Wiesel‚Äôs famous horizontal- and vertical-line detector neurons in cats (straight lines are redundant, reconstructable from their ends), and in the movement (‚Äúbug‚Äù) detectors in the frog retina, discovered by the same Jerry Lettvin and his colleagues. Movement represents a nonredundant change in the frog‚Äôs world. But even movement is redundant if it persists in the same direction at the same speed. Sure enough, Lettvin and colleagues discovered a ‚Äústrangeness‚Äù neuron in their frogs, which fires only when a moving object does something unexpected, such as speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. The strangeness neuron is tuned to filter out redundancy of a very high order.</p><p>Barlow pointed out that a survey of the sensory filters of a given animal could, in theory, give us a readout of the redundancies present in the animal‚Äôs world. They would constitute a kind of description of the statistical properties of that world. Which reminds me, I said I‚Äôd return to Darwin. In Unweaving the Rainbow, I suggested that the gene pool of a species is a ‚ÄúGenetic Book of the Dead,‚Äù a coded description of the ancestral worlds in which the genes of the species have survived through geological time. Natural selection is an averaging computer, detecting redundancies‚Äîrepeat patterns‚Äîin successive worlds (successive through millions of generations) in which the species has survived (averaged over all members of the sexually reproducing species). Could we take what Barlow did for neurons in sensory systems and do a parallel analysis for genes in naturally selected gene pools? Now, that would be deep, elegant, and beautiful.</p><p>THE POWER OF ABSURDITY</p><p>SCOTT ATRAN</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_34.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_36.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
