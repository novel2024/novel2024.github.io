Nesting (like Russian dolls) each of the five Platonic solids within a sphere, arranged in the proper order‚Äîoctahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube‚Äîhe proposed that the succession of spherical radii would have the same relative ratios as the planetary distances. Of course the deep, elegant, and beautiful solution was also wrong, but then, as Joe E. Brown famously said at the conclusion of Some Like It Hot, ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù</p><p>Two thousand years earlier, in a notion that would come to be described as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras had already sought a solution by relating those distances to the sites on a string where it needed to be plucked in order to produce notes pleasing to the ear. And almost 200 years after Kepler‚Äôs suggestion, Johann Bode and Johann Titius offered, with no underlying explanation, a simple numerical formula that supposedly fit the distances in question. So we see that Kepler‚Äôs explanation was neither the first nor the last attempt to explain the ratios of planetary-orbit radii, but in its linking of dynamics to geometry it remains, for me, the deepest, as well as being the simplest and most elegant.</p><p>In a strict sense, none of the three proposals is strictly wrong. They are instead solutions to a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist, for we now understand that the location of planets is purely accidental, a by-product of how the swirling disk of dust that circled our early sun evolved, under the force of gravity, into its present configuration. The realization that there was no problem came as our view expanded from one in which our planetary system was central to a far greater vision, in which it is one of an almost limitless number of such systems scattered throughout the vast numbers of galaxies comprising our universe.</p><p>I have been thinking about this because, together with many of my fellow theoretical physicists, I have spent a good part of my career searching for an explanation of the masses of the so-called elementary particles. But perhaps the reason it has eluded us is a proposal that is increasingly gaining credence‚Äînamely, that our visible universe is only a random example of an essentially infinite number of universes, all of which contain quarks and leptons with masses taking different values. It just happens that in at least one of those universes, the values allow for there being at least one star and one planet where creatures that worry about such problems live.</p><p>In other words, a problem we thought was central may once again have ceased to exist, as our conception of the universe has grown‚Äîin this case, been extended to one of many universes. If this is true, what grand vistas may lie before us in the future? I only hope that our descendants may have a much deeper understanding of these problems than we do and that they will smile at our feeble attempts to provide a deep, elegant, and beautiful solution to what they have recognized as a nonexistent problem.</p><p>HOW INCOMPATIBLE WORLDVIEWS CAN COEXIST</p><p>FREEMAN DYSON</p><p>Theoretical physicist, Institute for Advanced Study; author, A Many-Colored Glass: Reflections on the Place of Life in the Universe</p><p>The situation I am trying to explain is the existence side by side of two apparently incompatible pictures of the universe. One is the classical picture of our world as a collection of things and facts that we can see and feel, dominated by universal gravitation. The other is the quantum picture of atoms and radiation that behave in an unpredictable fashion, dominated by probabilities and uncertainties. Both pictures appear to be true, but the relationship between them is a mystery.</p><p>The orthodox view among physicists is that we must find a unified theory that includes both pictures as special cases. The unified theory must include a quantum theory of gravitation, so that particles called gravitons must exist, combining the properties of gravitation with quantum uncertainties.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_60.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_62.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
