Writers evoked Baudrillard as if we needed to be warned about escaping into our virtual worlds and leaving the brick-and-mortar, flesh-and-blood one behind. But I never saw computer simulations as so very dangerous. If anything, the obvious fakeness of computer simulations‚Äîfrom arcade games to Facebook‚Äînot only kept us aware of their simulated nature but called into question the reality of everything else.</p><p>So there‚Äôs the land‚Äîthis real stuff we walk around on. Then there‚Äôs territory‚Äîthe maps and lines we use to define the land. But then there are wars fought over where those map lines are drawn.</p><p>The levels can keep building on one another, bringing people to further abstractions and disconnection from the real world. Land becomes territory; territory then becomes property that is owned. Property itself can be represented by a deed, and the deed can be mortgaged. The mortgage is itself an investment that can be bet against with a derivative, which can be secured with a credit default swap.</p><p>The computer algorithm trading credit default swaps (as well as the programmers trying to follow that algorithm‚Äôs actions in order to devise competing algorithms)‚Äîthis level of interaction is real. And financially speaking, it has more influence over who gets to live in your house than almost any other factor. A credit-default-swap crisis can bankrupt a nation as big as the United States without changing anything about the real land it refers to.</p><p>Or take money: There‚Äôs the thing of value‚Äîthe labor, the chicken, the shoe. Then there‚Äôs the thing we use to represent that value‚Äîsay, gold, grain receipts, or gold certificates. But once we‚Äôre accustomed to using those receipts and notes as the equivalent of a thing with value, we can go one step further: the federal reserve note, or ‚Äúfiat‚Äù currency, which has no connection to gold, grain, or the labor, the chickens, the shoes. Three main steps: There‚Äôs value, the representation of value, and then the disconnection from what has value.</p><p>But that last disconnection is the important one‚Äîthe sad one, in many respects. Because that‚Äôs the moment we forget where things came from‚Äîwhen we forget what they represent. The simulation is put forth as reality. The invented landscape is naturalized and then mistaken for nature.</p><p>And that is when we become particularly vulnerable to illusion, abuse, and fantasy. Because once we‚Äôre living in a world of created symbols and simulations, whoever has control of the map has control of our reality.</p><p>TIME PERSPECTIVE THEORY</p><p>PHILIP ZIMBARDO</p><p>Professor emeritus of psychology, Stanford University; author, The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_160.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_162.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
