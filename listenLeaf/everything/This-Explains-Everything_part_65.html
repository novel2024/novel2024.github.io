Then all combinations of such three objects might exactly create the known pattern of quarks and leptons and neatly answer the above questions. The bizarre list of masses and conversion rates of the quarks and leptons would still remain unexplained but would be relegated to a level of discussion of understanding the dynamical forces binding the two more fundamental basic objects into a variety of compounds, rather than as a God-given or nature-given list of more than twenty free fundamental parameters.</p><p>An elegant explanation? Certainly. Correct? Not necessarily, as far as we know now. But you can never prove that particles are not made of more fundamental objects. This may well be discovered in the future without contradicting any current data, especially if the new structure is revealed only at smaller distances and higher energies than anything we have seen so far, or if it obeys a strange new set of basic physics rules. Needless to say, such a simple hypothesis needs to tackle many additional issues, some of which it does beautifully, while in others it fails badly. That may be the partly justified reason for the general negative attitude of most particle physicists to this simple explanation.</p><p>I find the idea of creating the entire universe from just two types of building blocks (which I call Rishons, or primaries) an elegant and enticing explanation of many observed facts. The book of Genesis starts with a universe that is ‚Äúformless and void,‚Äù or, in the original Hebrew, ‚ÄúTohu Vavohu.‚Äù What better notations for the two fundamental objects than T (Tohu, ‚Äúformless‚Äù) and V (Vohu, ‚Äúvoid‚Äù), and then each quark or lepton would consist of a different combination of three such Rishons, like TTV or TTT. This may remain forever as an elegant but incorrect idea, or it may be revealed one day as the next level of the structure of matter, following the atom, the nucleus, the proton, and the quark. Ask Mother Nature. She understands both ‚Äúelegant‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù but she is not yet telling.</p><p>OBSERVERS OBSERVING</p><p>ROBERT PROVINE</p><p>Neuroscientist and psychologist, University of Maryland; author, Curious Behavior: Yawning, Laughing, Hiccupping, and Beyond</p><p>The request for a favorite deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation left me a bit cold. ‚ÄúDeep,‚Äù ‚Äúelegant,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù are aesthetic qualities I associate more with experience and process than explanation, especially that of the observer observing. Observation is the link between all empirical sciences and the reason physicists were among the founders of experimental psychology. The difference between psychology and physics is one of emphasis; both involve the process of observers observing. Physics stresses the observed, psychology the observer. As horrifying as this may be to hyperempiricists, who neglect the observer, physics is necessarily the study of the behavior of physicists, biology the study of biologists, and so on.</p><p>Decades ago, I discussed this issue with John Wheeler, who found it obvious, noting that a major limit on cosmology is the cosmologist. When students in my course on Sensation and Perception hear me say that we‚Äôre engaging in the study of everything, I‚Äôm absolutely serious. In many ways, the study of sensation and perception is the most basic and universal of sciences.</p><p>My passion for observation is aesthetic as well as scientific. My most memorable observations are of the night sky. Others may name the discovery of a T. rex fossil or the sound of birdsong on a perfect spring day. To see better and deeper, I build telescopes, large and small. I like my photons fresh, not collected by CCD or analyzed by computer. I want to encounter the cosmos head on, letting it wash over my retina. My profession of neuroscience provides its own observational adventures, including the unique opportunity to close the circle by investigating the neurological mechanism through which the observer observes and comes to know the cosmos.</p><p>GENES, CLAUSTRUM, AND CONSCIOUSNESS</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_64.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_66.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
