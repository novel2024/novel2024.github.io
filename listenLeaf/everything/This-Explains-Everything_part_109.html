The good news that the sun would not burn out anytime soon came with the bad news that the sun would certainly burn out in a few billion years. But first it would engulf the molten Earth in its red-giant phase.</p><p>The same explanation said further that in cosmic due course all the stars would burn out or blow up. There is no free lunch in the heat and light that results when simpler atoms fuse into slightly more complex atoms and when mass transforms into energy. There would not even be stars for long. The universe would go dark and get ever closer to absolute-zero cold. The result would be a faint white noise of sparse energy and matter. Even the black holes would, over eons, burn out or leak out into the near nothingness of an almost perfect faint white noise. That steady-state white noise will have effectively zero information content. It will be the last few steps in a staggeringly long sequence of irreversible nonlinear steps or processes that make up the evolution of the universe. So there will be no way to figure out the lives and worlds that preceded it, even if something arose that could figure.</p><p>The explanation of why the sun still shines is as deep as it gets. It explains doomsday.</p><p>BOSCOVICH‚ÄôS EXPLANATION OF ATOMIC FORCES</p><p>CHARLES SIMONYI</p><p>Creator, WYSIWYG word processor; cofounder, Intentional Software; former director of application development and chief software architect, Microsoft Corporation</p><p>An example of how amazing insight can spring from simple considerations is the explanation of atomic forces by the 18th-century Jesuit polymath Roger Boscovich.</p><p>One of the great philosophical arguments at the time took place between the adherents of Descartes who‚Äîfollowing Aristotle‚Äîthought that forces can only be the result of immediate contact, and those who followed Newton and believed in his concept of force acting at a distance. Newton was the revolutionary here, but his opponents argued‚Äîwith some justification‚Äîthat ‚Äúaction at a distance‚Äù brought back into physics ‚Äúoccult‚Äù explanations that do not follow from the clear understanding that Descartes demanded. Boscovich, a forceful advocate of the Newtonian point of view, turned the question around: Let‚Äôs understand exactly what happens during the interaction that we would call ‚Äúimmediate contact.‚Äù</p><p>His arguments are easy to understand and extremely convincing. Let‚Äôs imagine two bodies, one traveling at a speed of, say, 6 units, the other at a speed of 12, with the faster body catching up with the slower along the same straight path. When the two bodies collide, by conservation of the quantity of motion, both should continue after collision along the same path, each with a speed of 9 units in the case of inelastic collision (or, in case of elastic collision, for a brief period right after the collision).</p><p>But how did the velocity of the faster body come to be reduced from 12 to 9 and that of the slower body increased from 6 to 9? Clearly, the time interval for the change in velocities cannot be zero, for then, argued Boscovich, the instantaneous change in speed would violate the law of continuity. Furthermore, we would have to say that at the moment of impact, the speed of one body is simultaneously 12 and 9, which is patently absurd.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_108.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_110.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
