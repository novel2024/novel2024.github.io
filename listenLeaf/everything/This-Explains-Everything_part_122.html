The title, like an explanation of a phenomenon, unlocks the works, describing their relation to one of the most important cultural figures of the 20th century, John Cage, who shares with Richter the great themes of chance and uncertainty.</p><p>THE TRUE ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY OF SPACE</p><p>SETH LLOYD</p><p>Professor of quantum mechanical engineering, MIT; author, Programming the Universe</p><p>The following deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation of the true rotational symmetry of space comes from the late Sidney Coleman, as presented to his graduate physics class at Harvard. This explanation takes the form of a physical act that you will perform yourself. Although elegant, the explanation is verbally awkward to explain and physically awkward to perform. It may need to be practiced a few times. So limber up and get ready: You are about to experience in a deep and personal way the true rotational symmetry of space!</p><p>At bottom, the laws of physics are based on symmetries, and the rotational symmetry of space is one of the most profound of these symmetries. The most rotationally symmetric object is a sphere. So take a sphere such as a soccer ball or basketball that has on it a mark, logo, or unique lettering at some spot. Rotate the sphere about any axis: The rotational symmetry of space implies that the shape of the sphere is invariant under rotation. In addition, if there is a mark on the sphere, then when you rotate the sphere by 360Àö, the mark returns to its initial position. Go ahead; try it. Hold the ball in both hands and rotate it by 360Àö until the mark returns.</p><p>That‚Äôs not so awkward, you may say. But that‚Äôs because you have not yet demonstrated the true rotational symmetry of space. To demonstrate this symmetry requires fancier moves. Now hold the ball cupped in one hand, palm facing up. Your goal is to rotate the sphere while keeping your palm up. This is trickier, but if Michael Jordan can do it, so can you.</p><p>The steps are as follows:</p><p>Keeping your palm up, rotate the ball inward toward your body. At 90Àö, one quarter of a full rotation, the ball is comfortably tucked under your arm.</p><p>Keep on rotating in the same direction, palm up. At 180Àö, half a rotation, your arm sticks out in back of your body to keep the ball cupped in your palm.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_121.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_123.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
