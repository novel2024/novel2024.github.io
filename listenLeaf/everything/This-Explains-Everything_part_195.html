Peter pricked the maidenhead of American capitalism. “In a hierarchy,” he stated, “every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.” He called it the Peter Principle, and it appeared in a book of the same name. The little volume, not even 180 pages long, went on to become the year’s top seller, with some 200,000 copies going out bookstore doors. It’s not hard to see why. Not only did the Peter Principle confirm what everyone suspected—bosses are dolts—but it explained why this had to be so. When a person excels at a job, he gets promoted. And he keeps getting promoted until he attains a job that he’s not very good at. Then the promotions stop. He has found his level of incompetence. And there he stays, interminably.</p><p>The Peter Principle was a hook with many barbs. It didn’t just expose the dunderhead in the corner office. It took the centerpiece of the American dream—the desire to climb the ladder of success—and revealed it to be a recipe for mass mediocrity. Enterprise was an elaborate ruse, a vector through which the incompetent made their affliction universal. But there was more. The principle had, as a New York Times reviewer put it, “cosmic implications.” It wasn’t long before scientists developed the “Generalized Peter Principle,” which went thus: “In evolution, systems tend to develop up to the limit of their adaptive competence.” Everything progresses to the point at which it founders. The shape of existence is the shape of failure.</p><p>The most memorable explanations strike us as alarmingly obvious. They take commonplace observations—things we’ve all experienced—and tease the hidden truth out of them. Most of us go through life bumping into trees. It takes a great explainer, like Laurence J. Peter, to tell us we’re in a forest.</p><p>THE PRINCIPLE OF EMPIRICISM, OR SEE FOR YOURSELF</p><p>MICHAEL SHERMER</p><p>Publisher, Skeptic magazine; monthly columnist, Scientific American; author, The Believing Brain</p><p>Empiricism is the deepest and broadest principle for explaining the most phenomena in both the natural and social worlds. Empiricism is the principle that says we should see for ourselves instead of trusting the authority of others. Empiricism is the foundation of science, as the motto of the Royal Society of London—the first scientific institution—notes. Nullius in Verba—Take nobody’s word for it.</p><p>Galileo took nobody’s word for it. According to Aristotelian cosmology, the Catholic Church’s final and indisputable authority of Truth on matters heavenly, all objects in space must be perfectly round and perfectly smooth, and revolve around Earth in perfectly circular orbits. Yet when Galileo looked for himself through his tiny tube with a refracting lens on one end and an enlarging eyepiece on the other, he saw mountains on the moon, spots on the sun, phases of Venus, moons orbiting Jupiter, and a strange object around Saturn. Galileo’s eminent astronomer colleague at the University of Padua, Cesare Cremonini, was so committed to Aristotelian cosmology that he refused even to look through the tube, proclaiming: “I don’t believe that anyone but he saw them, and besides, looking through glasses would make me dizzy.” Those who did look through Galileo’s tube could not believe their eyes—literally. One of Galileo’s colleagues reported that the instrument worked for terrestrial viewing but not celestial, because “I tested this instrument of Galileo’s in a thousand ways, both on things here below and on those above. Below, it works wonderfully; in the sky it deceives one.”* A professor of mathematics at the Collegio Romano was convinced that Galileo had put the four moons of Jupiter inside the tube. Galileo was apoplectic: “As I wished to show the satellites of Jupiter to the professors in Florence, they would neither see them nor the telescope. These people believe there is no truth to seek in nature, but only in the comparison of texts.”*</p><p>By looking for themselves, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and others launched the Scientific Revolution, which in the Enlightenment led scholars to apply the principle of empiricism to the social as well as the natural world. The great political philosopher Thomas Hobbes, for example, fancied himself as the Galileo and William Harvey of society: “Galileus . . . was the first that opened to us the gate of natural philosophy universal, which is the knowledge of the nature of motion. . . . The science of man’s body, the most profitable part of natural science, was first discovered with admirable sagacity by our countryman, Doctor Harvey. . . . Natural philosophy is therefore but young; but civil philosophy is yet much younger, as being no older . . . than my own de Cive.”*</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_194.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_196.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
