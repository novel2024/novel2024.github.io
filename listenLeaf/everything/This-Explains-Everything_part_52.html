As individual consumers, we, too, are a selective and hence creative force. And we do not act only as individuals but also as members of social groups. Experiments show that if we know what music other people are listening to, we are quite ready to subsume (if not totally abandon) our own aesthetic preferences and follow the herd‚Äîa phenomenon that explains why it‚Äôs so hard to predict hits. So composers, consumers, and groups of consumers all shape the world of music. Umberto Eco made much the same point as long ago as 1962, in Opera Aperta (The Open Work). Of course, as a literary critic Eco could do no more than draw attention to the problem. But George Price solved it.</p><p>In 1972, Price extended his general variation-selection equation to allow for multilevel selection. This form of the equation has been useful to evolutionary biologists, allowing them to see, for example, the relationship between kin- and group-selection clearly and so put to rest endless controversies stemming from incompatible mathematical formulations. It hasn‚Äôt yet been applied to cultural evolution, though it surely will be. But the extended Price equation is much more important than even that. It slices one of the Gordian knots that scientists and philosophers of science have long wrestled with.</p><p>This is the knot of reducibility. Can the behavior of a system be understood in terms of‚Äîthat is, be reduced to‚Äîthe behavior of its components? This question, in one form or another, pervades science. Systems biologists vs. biochemists, cognitive scientists vs. neuroscientists, Durkheim vs. Bentham, Gould vs. Dawkins, Aristotle vs. Democritus‚Äîthe gulf (epistemological, ontological, and methodological) between the holist vs. reductionist stances lies at the root of many of science‚Äôs greatest disputes. It is also the source of advances, as one stance is abandoned in favor of another. Indeed, holist and reductionist research programs often exist side by side in uneasy truce (think of any biology department). But when, as so often, the truce breaks down and open warfare resumes, it‚Äôs clear that what‚Äôs needed is a way of rationally partitioning the creative forces operating at different levels.</p><p>That is what Price gave. His equation applies only to variation-selection systems, but if you think about it, most order-creating systems are variation-selection systems. Returning to our musical world: Who really shapes it? Beethoven‚Äôs epigones tweaking their MIDI files? Adolescents downloading in the solitude of their bedrooms? The massed impulses of the public? I think that Price‚Äôs equation can explain. It certainly has some explaining to do.</p><p>UNCONSCIOUS INFERENCES</p><p>GERD GIGERENZER</p><p>Psychologist; director of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin; author, Gut Feelings: The Intelligence of the Unconscious</p><p>Optical illusions are a pleasure to look at, puzzling, and robust. Even if you know better, you still are caught in the illusion. Why do they exist? Are they merely mental quirks? The physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821‚Äì1894) provided us with a beautiful explanation of the nature of perception and how it generates perceptual illusions of depth, space, and other properties. Perception requires smart bets called unconscious inferences.</p><p>In Volume III of his Physiological Optics, Helmholtz recounts a childhood experience:</p><p>I can recall when I was a boy going past the garrison chapel in Potsdam, where some people were standing in the belfry. I mistook them for dolls and asked my mother to reach up and get them for me, which I thought she could do. The circumstances were impressed on my memory, because it was by this mistake that I learned to understand the law of foreshortening in perspective.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_51.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_53.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
