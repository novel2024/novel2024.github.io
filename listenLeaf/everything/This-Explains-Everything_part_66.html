RAMACHANDRAN</p><p>Neuroscientist; professor & director, Center for Brain and Cognition, University of California–San Diego; author, The Tell-Tale Brain</p><p>What’s my favorite elegant idea? The elucidation of DNA’s structure is surely the most obvious, but it bears repeating. I’ll argue that the same strategy used to crack the genetic code might prove successful in cracking the “neural code” of consciousness and self. It’s a long shot, but worth considering.</p><p>The ability to grasp analogies, and to see the difference between deep and superficial ones, is a hallmark of many great scientists. Francis Crick and James Watson were no exception. Crick himself cautioned against the pursuit of elegance in biology, given that evolution proceeds happenstantially. “God is a hacker,” he said, adding (according to my colleague Don Hoffman), “Many a young biologist has slit his own throat with Occam’s razor.” Yet his own solution to the riddle of heredity ranks with natural selection as biology’s most elegant discovery. Will a solution of similar elegance emerge for the problem of consciousness?</p><p>It is well known that Crick and Watson unraveled the double-helical structure of the DNA molecule: two twisting complementary strands of nucleotides. Less well known is the chain of events culminating in this discovery.</p><p>First, Mendel’s laws dictated that genes are particulate (a first approximation, still held to be accurate). Then Thomas Morgan showed that fruit flies zapped with X-rays became mutants with punctate changes in their chromosomes, yielding the clear conclusion that the chromosomes are where the action is. Chromosomes are composed of histones and DNA; as early as 1928, the British bacteriologist Fred Griffith showed that a harmless species of bacterium, upon incubation with a heat-killed virulent species, changes into the virulent species. This was almost as startling as a pig walking into a room with a sheep and two sheep emerging. Later, Oswald Avery showed that DNA was the transformative principle here. In biology, knowledge of structure often leads to knowledge of function—one need look no further than the whole of medical history. Inspired by Griffith and Avery, Crick and Watson realized that the answer to the problem of heredity lay in the structure of DNA. Localization was critical, as, indeed, it may prove to be for brain function.</p><p>Crick and Watson didn’t just describe DNA’s structure, they explained its significance. They saw the analogy between the complementarity of molecular strands and the complementarity of parent and offspring—why pigs beget pigs and not sheep. At that moment, modern biology was born. There are similar correlations between brain structure and mind function, between neurons and consciousness. (I’m stating the obvious here only because there are some philosophers, called “new mysterians,” who believe the opposite.)</p><p>After his triumph with heredity, Crick turned to what he called the “second great riddle” in biology—consciousness. There were many skeptics. I remember a seminar Crick gave on consciousness at the Salk Institute here in La Jolla. He’d barely started when a gentleman in attendance raised a hand and said, “But Dr. Crick, you haven’t even bothered to define the word ‘consciousness’ before embarking on this.” Crick’s response was memorable: “I’d remind you that there was never a time in the history of biology when a bunch of us sat around the table and said, ‘Let’s first define what we mean by life.’ We just went out there and discovered what it was—a double helix. We leave matters of semantic hygiene to you philosophers.”</p><p>Crick did not, in my opinion, succeed in solving consciousness (whatever it might mean). Nonetheless, he was headed in the right direction. He had been richly rewarded earlier in his career for grasping the analogy between biological complementarities, the notion that the structural logic of the molecule dictates the functional logic of heredity. Given his phenomenal success using the strategy of structure-function analogy, it is hardly surprising that he imported the same style of thinking to study consciousness. He and his colleague Christof Koch did so by focusing on a relatively obscure structure called the claustrum.</p><p>The claustrum is a thin sheet of cells underlying the insular cortex of the brain, one on each hemisphere. It is histologically more homogeneous than most brain structures, and unlike most brain structures (which send and receive signals to and from a small subset of other structures), the claustrum is reciprocally connected with almost every cortical region. The structural and functional streamlining might ensure that when waves of information come through the claustrum, its neurons will be exquisitely sensitive to the timing of the inputs.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_65.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_67.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
