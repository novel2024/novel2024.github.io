Size, distance, and other properties need to be inferred from uncertain cues, which in turn have to be learned by experience. Based on this experience, the brain draws unconscious inferences about what a sensation means. In other words, perception is a kind of bet about what‚Äôs really out there.</p><p>But how exactly does this inference work? Helmholtz drew an analogy with probabilistic syllogisms. The major premise is a collection of experiences that are long out of consciousness; the minor premise is the present sensory impression. Consider the ‚Äúdots illusion‚Äù of V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues at the Center for Brain and Cognition, University of California‚ÄìSan Diego:</p><p>The dots in the left picture appear concave, receding into the surface away from the observer, while those on the right side appear convex, curved toward the observer. If you turn the page around, the inward dots will pop out and vice versa. In fact, the two pictures are identical, except for being rotated 180 degrees. The illusion of concave and convex dots occurs because our brain makes unconscious inferences.</p><p>Major premise:</p><p>A shade on the upper part of a dot is nearly always associated with a concave shape.</p><p>Minor premise:</p><p>The shade is in the upper part.</p><p>Unconscious inference:</p><p>The shape of the dot is concave.</p><p>Our brains assume a three-dimensional world, and the major premise guesses the third dimension from two ecological structures:</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_52.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_54.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
