The more they claimed that the ‚Äúpower and glory‚Äù of string theory (a failed piece of 1970s subatomic physics which has mysteriously lingered into the 21st century) was the ‚Äúonly game in town,‚Äù the more it looked like strings-based unification, lacking testable predictions, was itself sinking with a glug to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>What we learned from this episode was profound. If the physicists failed, it was only in their own terms that they went down to defeat. Just as in an earlier era, in which a number of physicists retooled to become the first generation of molecular biologists, physicists came to dominate much of modern geometry in the last four decades, scoring numerous successes that will stand the tests of time. Likewise their quest to quantize geometry backfired in the most romantic and elegant way possible, by instead geometrizing the quantum which, in hindsight, was needed to fill in a gaping hole left by the mathematical geometers. This lacuna would have been discovered sooner or later by mathematicians, as it is by now seen as an entirely natural piece of pure mathematics. Quantum field theory, despite its name, turns out really to be a piece of pure mathematics developed by ingenious amateurs out of the need to unpack the consequences of the fundamental equations representing the true physical content.</p><p>But the most important lesson is that, at a minimum, Einstein‚Äôs minor dream has already been realized as something of a group effort. All known physical phenomena can now be recognized as fashioned from the pure marble of geometry, through the efforts of a pantheon of new giants with less familiar names, like Quillen, Singer, Simons, Atiyah, Witten, Penrose, Yang, Schwartz, Seiberg, Segal, Hitchin, and Jackiw. This explains, in advance of unification, that the source code of the universe is likely to be a purely geometric operating system written in a single programming language. While that leaves the quest for the unifying physics unfinished and the marble something of a motley patchwork of colors, it suggests that the leaders during the years of the Standard Model have put this period of stasis to good use for the benefit of those of us who hope to follow.</p><p>WHAT TIME IS IT?</p><p>DAVE WINER</p><p>Software developer; founder, UserLand Software; editor, Scripting News weblog</p><p>A few years ago, I heard it said that only old-fashioned folk wear watches.
