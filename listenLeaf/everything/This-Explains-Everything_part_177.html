What makes the implications of this answer so profound is that they lead to the inescapable conclusion that personality differences are greatly influenced by chance events.</p><p>Two types of chance events influence the genetic contribution to personality. The first, and most obvious, is the events that brought together the person‚Äôs mom and dad. Each of them has a particular collection of gene variants‚Äîa personal sample of the variants that have accumulated in the collective human genome‚Äîand the two parental genetic repertoires set limits on the possible variants that can be transmitted to their offspring. The second chance event is the hit-or-miss union of the particular egg and sperm that make the offspring, each of which contains a random selection of half of the gene variants of each parent. It is the interactions of the resultant unique mixture of maternal and paternal gene variants that play a major part in the twenty-five-year-long developmental process that builds the person‚Äôs brain and personality. So two accidents of birth‚Äîthe parents who conceive us, and the egg/sperm combinations that make us‚Äîhave decisive influences on the kinds of people we become.</p><p>But genes don‚Äôt act alone. Although there are innate programs of gene expression that continue to unfold through early adulthood to direct the construction of rough drafts of brain circuits, these programs are specifically designed to incorporate information from the person‚Äôs physical and social world. Some of this adaptation to the person‚Äôs particular circumstances must come at specific developmental periods, called critical periods. For example, the brain circuits that control the characteristic intonations of a person‚Äôs native language are open for environmental input only during a limited window of development.</p><p>And just as chance influences the particular set of genes we are born with, so does it influence the particular environment we are born into. Just as our genes incline us to be more or less friendly, or confident, or reliable, the worlds we grow up in incline us to adopt particular goals, opportunities, and rules of conduct. The most obvious aspects of these worlds are cultural, religious, social, and economic, each transmitted by critical agents: parents, siblings, teachers, and peers. And the specific content of these important influences‚Äîthe specific era, place, culture, etc., that we happen to have been born into‚Äîis as much a toss of the dice as the specific content of the egg and sperm that formed us.</p><p>Of course, chance is not fate. Recognizing that chance events contribute to individual personality differences doesn‚Äôt mean that each life is predetermined or that there is no free will. The personality arising through biological and sociocultural accidents of birth can be deliberately modified in many ways, even in maturity. Nevertheless, the chance events that direct brain development in our first few decades leave enduring residues.</p><p>When thinking about a particular personality, it is therefore helpful to be aware of the powerful role chance played in its construction. Recognizing the importance of chance in our individual differences doesn‚Äôt just remove some of their mystery‚Äîit can also have moral consequences by promoting understanding and compassion for the wide range of people with whom we share our lives.</p><p>METABOLIC SYNDROME: CELL ENERGY ADAPTATIONS IN A TOXIC WORLD?</p><p>BEATRICE GOLOMB</p><p>Professor of medicine, University of California‚ÄìSan Diego</p><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) has been called the epidemic of the 21st century. MetSyn is an accretion of symptoms, including high body-mass index, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high blood triglycerides, high waist circumference, and/or reduced HDL cholesterol, the so-called good cholesterol. Epidemics of obesity and diabetes are intertwined with and accompany the meteoric rise in MetSyn.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_176.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_178.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
