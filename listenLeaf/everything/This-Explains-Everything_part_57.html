Instead I will go small. When Planck introduced his quantum of action at the turn of the 20th century, he realized that this allowed for a new set of natural units. For example, the Planck time is the square root of Planck‚Äôs constant times the gravitational constant divided by the fifth power of the speed of light. It is the smallest unit of time anyone talks about, but is it a ‚Äútime‚Äù? The problem is that these constants are just that. They are the same to a resting observer as to a moving one. But the time is not. I posed this as a ‚Äúdivinette‚Äù to my ‚Äúcoven,‚Äù and Freeman Dyson came up with a beautiful answer. He tried to construct a clock that would measure it. Using the quantum uncertainties, he showed that it would be consumed by a black hole of its own making. No measurement is possible. The Planck time ain‚Äôt a time‚Äîor it may be beyond time.</p><p>WHY IS OUR WORLD COMPREHENSIBLE?</p><p>ANDREI LINDE</p><p>Father of eternal chaotic inflation; professor of physics, Stanford University</p><p>‚ÄúThe most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.‚Äù So said Albert Einstein. A similar problem was noted by Eugene Wigner, who said that the unreasonable efficiency of mathematics is ‚Äúa wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.‚Äù</p><p>Why do we live in a comprehensible universe, with certain rules that can be efficiently used for predicting our future?</p><p>Of course, one could always respond that this is ‚Äújust so‚Äù‚Äîthat God created the universe and made it simple enough so that we could comprehend it. But shall we give up so easily? Let us consider several other questions of a similar type. Why is our universe so large? Why don‚Äôt parallel lines intersect? Why do different parts of the universe look so similar? For a long time, such questions seemed too metaphysical to be considered seriously. Now we know that inflationary cosmology provides a possible answer to all of them.</p><p>To understand the issue, let‚Äôs consider some examples of an incomprehensible universe, where mathematics is inefficient. Suppose the universe is in a state of the so-called Planck density: r ~ 1094 g/cm3, which is 94 orders of magnitude greater than the density of water. According to the theory of quantum gravity, quantum fluctuations of spacetime in this regime are so large that all measuring sticks are rapidly bending, shrinking, and extending in a chaotic and unpredictable way‚Äîfaster than you could measure distance with them. All clocks are destroyed faster than you could measure time with them. All records of previous events become erased, so that you cannot remember anything, record it, and predict the future. The universe is incomprehensible to anybody living there (if life is possible there at all), and the laws of mathematics cannot be efficiently used.</p><p>If the huge-density example looks a bit extreme, rest assured that it is not. There are three basic types of universes: closed, open, and flat. A typical closed universe created in the hot Big Bang would collapse in about 10-43 seconds into a state with the Planck density, unless it had a huge size to start with. A typical open universe created in the Big Bang would grow so fast that formation of galaxies would be impossible, and our bodies (if we were lucky enough to be born) would be instantly torn apart. Nobody could live in, let alone comprehend, the universe in either of these two cases. We can enjoy life in a flat, or nearly flat, universe (which is what we do now), but unless something special (inflation, see below) happens, this requires fine-tuning of initial conditions at the moment of the Big Bang with an incredible accuracy of about 10-60.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_56.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_58.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
