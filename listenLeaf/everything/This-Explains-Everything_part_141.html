You can measure this special hormone in the amniotic fluid that bathes the fetus in the womb. It gets into the amniotic fluid by being excreted by the fetus and so is thought to reflect the levels of this hormone in the baby‚Äôs body and brain. My Cambridge colleagues and I measured unborn male babies‚Äô testosterone in this way and then invited them into an MRI brain scanner some ten years later. In a recent paper in the Journal of Neuroscience, our group shows, for example, that the more testosterone there is in the amniotic fluid, the less gray matter in the planum temporale.*</p><p>This fits with an earlier finding we published, that the more testosterone in the amniotic fluid, the smaller the child‚Äôs vocabulary size at age two.* This helps make sense of a longstanding puzzle about why girls talk earlier than boys and why boys are disproportionately represented in clinics for language delays and disorders, since boys in the womb produce at least twice as much testosterone as girls.</p><p>It also helps make sense of the puzzle of individual differences in rate of language development in typical children regardless of their sex: why at two years old some children have huge vocabularies (600 words) and others haven‚Äôt even started talking. Fetal testosterone is not the only factor involved in language development‚Äîso are social influences, since firstborn children develop language faster than later children‚Äîbut it seems to be a key part of the explanation. And fetal testosterone has been shown to be associated with a host of other sex-linked features, from eye contact to empathy and from detailed attention to autistic traits.</p><p>Fetal testosterone is tricky to get your hands on, since the last thing a scientist wants to do is interfere with the delicate homeostasis of the uterine environment. In recent years, a proxy for fetal testosterone has been proposed: the ratio between the second- and fourth-finger lengths, or the 2D:4D ratio. Males have a lower ratio than females in the population, and this is held to be set in the womb and to remain stable throughout one‚Äôs life. So scientists no longer have to think of imaginative ways to measure the testosterone levels directly in the womb. They can simply take a xerox of someone‚Äôs hand, palm down, at any time in their life to measure a proxy for levels of testosterone in the womb.</p><p>I was skeptical of the 2D:4D measure for a long time, simply because it made little sense that the relative length of your second and fourth fingers should have anything to do with your hormones prenatally. But just last year, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Zheng and Cohn showed that even in mice paws, the density of receptors for testosterone and estrogen varies in the second and fourth digits, making a beautiful explanation for why your finger-length ratio is directly affected by these hormones.* The same hormone that masculinizes your brain is at work at your fingertips.</p><p>WHY DO MOVIES MOVE?</p><p>ALVY RAY SMITH</p><p>Cofounder, Pixar; digital imagery pioneer</p><p>Movies are not smooth. The time between frames is empty. The camera records only twenty-four snapshots of each second of time flow and discards everything that happens between frames‚Äîbut we perceive it anyway. We see stills, but we perceive motion. How can we explain this? We can ask the same question about digital movies, videos, and videogames‚Äîin fact, all modern digital media‚Äîso the explanation is rather important, and one of my favorites.</p><p>Hoary old ‚Äúpersistence of vision‚Äù can‚Äôt be the explanation. It‚Äôs real, but it explains only why you don‚Äôt see the emptiness between frames. If an actor or an animated character moves between frames, then‚Äîby persistence of vision‚Äîyou should see him in both positions: two Humphrey Bogarts, two Buzz Lightyears. In fact, your retinas do see both, one fading out as the other comes in‚Äîeach frame is projected long enough to ensure this. It‚Äôs what your brain does with the retinas‚Äô information that determines whether you perceive two Bogarts in two different positions or one Bogart moving.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_140.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_142.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
