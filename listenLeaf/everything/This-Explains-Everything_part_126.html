MATHER</p><p>Senior astrophysicist, Observational Cosmology Laboratory, NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Center; coauthor (with John Boslough), The Very First Light</p><p>What explains the extraordinary complexity of the observed universe, on all scales from quarks to the accelerating universe? My favorite explanation (which I certainly did not invent) is that the fundamental laws of physics produce natural instability, energy flows, and chaos. Some call the result the Life Force, some note that the Earth is a living system itself (Gaia, a ‚Äútough bitch,‚Äù according to the late Lynn Margulis), and some conclude that the observed complexity requires a supernatural explanation (of which we have many). But my dad was a statistician (of dairy cows) and he told me about cells and genes and evolution and chance when I was very small. So a scientist must look for the explanation of how nature‚Äôs laws and statistics brought us into conscious existence. And how it is that seemingly improbable events are happening all the time.</p><p>Well, physicists have countless examples of natural instability, in which energy is released to power change from simplicity to complexity. One of the most common is that cooling water vapor below the freezing point produces snowflakes, no two alike and all complex and beautiful. We see it often, so we‚Äôre not amazed. But physicists have observed so many kinds of these changes from one structure to another (we call them phase transitions) that the Nobel Prize in 1992 could be awarded for understanding the mathematics of their common features.</p><p>Now for a few examples of how the laws of nature produce the instabilities that lead to our own existence. First, the Big Bang (what an insufficient name!) apparently came from an instability, in which the ‚Äúfalse vacuum‚Äù eventually decayed into the ordinary vacuum we have today, plus the most fundamental particles we know, the quarks and leptons. So the universe as a whole started with an instability. Then a great expansion and cooling happened, and the loose quarks, finding themselves unstable too, bound themselves together into today‚Äôs less elementary particles‚Äîprotons and neutrons‚Äîliberating a little energy and creating complexity. Then the expanding universe cooled some more, and neutrons and protons, no longer kept apart by immense temperatures, found themselves unstable and formed helium nuclei. Then a little more cooling, and atomic nuclei and electrons were no longer kept apart and the universe became transparent. Then a little more cooling, and the next instability began: Gravitation pulled matter together across cosmic distances to form stars and galaxies. This instability is described as a ‚Äúnegative heat capacity,‚Äù in which extracting energy from a gravitating system makes it hotter‚Äîclearly the second law of thermodynamics does not apply here. (This is the physicists‚Äô version of e. e. cummings‚Äôs notion of ‚Äúthe wonder that‚Äôs keeping the stars apart.‚Äù) Then the next instability is that hydrogen and helium nuclei fuse to release energy and make stars burn for billions of years. And then at the end of the fuel source, stars become unstable and explode and liberate their chemical elements into space. And because of that, on planets like Earth, sustained energy flows support the development of additional instabilities and all kinds of complex patterns. Gravitational instability pulls the densest materials into the core of the Earth, leaving a thin skin of water and air, and makes the interior churn incessantly as heat flows outward. And the heat from the sun, received mostly near the equator and flowing toward the poles, supports the complex atmospheric and oceanic circulations.</p><p>And because of all that, the physical Earth is full of natural chemical laboratories, concentrating elements here, mixing them there, raising and lowering temperatures, ceaselessly experimenting with uncountable events where new instabilities can arise. At least one of them was the new experiment called Life. Now that we know there are at least as many planets as there are stars, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that nature‚Äôs ceaseless experimentation would not be able to produce Life elsewhere‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt know for sure.</p><p>And Life went on to cause new instabilities, constantly evolving, with living things in an extraordinary range of environments, changing the global environment, with boom-and-bust cycles, with predators for every kind of prey, with criminals for every possible crime, with governments to prevent them, and instabilities of the governments themselves.</p><p>One of the instabilities is that humans demand new weapons and new products of all sorts, leading to serious investments in science and technology. So the natural/human world of competition and combat is structured to lead to advanced weaponry and cell phones. So here we are in 2012, with people writing essays and wondering whether their descendants will be artificial life-forms traveling back into space. And pondering what the origins of those forces of nature are that give rise to everything. The Dutch theoretical physicist Erik Verlinde has argued that gravitation, the one force that has so far resisted our efforts at a quantum description, is not even a fundamental force but is itself a statistical force, like osmosis.</p><p>What an amazing turn of events! But after all I‚Äôve just said, I should not be surprised a bit.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_125.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_127.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
