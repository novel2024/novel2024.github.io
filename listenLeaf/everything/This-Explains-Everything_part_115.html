That is the Higgs mechanism, named after the physicist Peter Higgs, who developed it. The Higgs mechanism is probably responsible for the masses of elementary particles, such as the electron. If the electron had zero mass (like the photon), it wouldn‚Äôt be bound into atoms and none of the structure of our universe would be present.</p><p>In any case, experiments have measured the masses of elementary particles and they don‚Äôt vanish. We know they exist. The problem is that these masses violate the underlying symmetry structure we know to be present in the physical description of these particles. More concretely, if elementary particles had mass from the get-go, the theory would make ridiculous predictions about very energetic particles; for example, it would predict interaction probabilities greater than one.</p><p>So here is a significant puzzle. How can particles have masses that have physical consequences and can be measured at low energies but act as if they don‚Äôt have masses at high energies, when predictions would become nonsensical? That is what the Higgs mechanism tells us. We don‚Äôt yet know for certain that it is indeed responsible for the origin of elementary particle masses, but no one has found an alternative satisfactory explanation.</p><p>One way to understand the Higgs mechanism is in terms of what is known as spontaneous symmetry-breaking, which I‚Äôd say is itself a beautiful idea. A spontaneously broken symmetry is broken by the actual state of nature, but not by the physical laws. For example, if you sit at a dinner table and use the glass on your right, so will everyone else. The dinner table is symmetrical‚Äîyou have a glass on your right and also your left. Yet everyone chooses the glass on the right and thereby spontaneously breaks the left-right symmetry that would otherwise be present.</p><p>Nature does something similar. The physical laws describing an object called a Higgs field respect the symmetry of nature. Yet the actual state of the Higgs field breaks the symmetry. At low energy, it takes a particular value. This non-vanishing Higgs field is somewhat akin to a charge spread throughout the vacuum (the state of the universe with no actual particles). Particles acquire their masses by interacting with these ‚Äúcharges.‚Äù Because this value appears only at low energies, particles effectively have masses only at these energies, and the apparent bottleneck to elementary particle masses is apparently resolved.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Standard Model of Particle Physics has worked extremely well, even though we do not yet know whether the Higgs mechanism is correct. We don‚Äôt need to know about the Higgs mechanism to know that particles have masses and to make many successful predictions with the Standard Model. But the Higgs mechanism is essential to explaining how those masses can arise in a sensible theory. The Standard Model‚Äôs success nonetheless illustrates another beautiful idea essential to all of physics, which is the concept of an ‚Äúeffective theory.‚Äù The idea is simply that you can focus on measurable quantities when making predictions and leave understanding the source of those quantities to later research when you have better precision.</p><p>Fortunately that time has now come for the Higgs mechanism, or at least the simplest implementation, which involves a particle called the Higgs boson. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN, near Geneva, should have a definitive result within the year on whether this particle exists. [Author‚Äôs note: Just before this book went to press, the discovery was announced. Now that a Higgs boson has been found, its properties can be measured to verify whether or not it conforms to the simplest expectations or a more elaborate implementation of the Higgs mechanism.] If confirmed, it will demonstrate that the Higgs mechanism is correct and will furthermore tell us what is the underlying structure responsible for spontaneous symmetry-breaking and spreading ‚Äúcharge‚Äù throughout the vacuum. The Higgs boson would furthermore be a new type of particle (a fundamental boson, for those versed in physics terminology) and would be in some sense a new type of force. Admittedly, this is all pretty subtle and esoteric. Yet I (and much of the theoretical physics community) find it beautiful, deep, and elegant.</p><p>Symmetry is great. But so is symmetry-breaking. Over the years, many aspects of particle physics were first considered ugly and then considered elegant. Subjectivity in science goes beyond communities to individual scientists. And even those scientists change their minds over time. That‚Äôs why experiments are critical. As difficult as they are, results are much easier to pin down than the nature of beauty.</p><p>THE MIND THINKS IN EMBODIED METAPHORS</p><p>SIMONE SCHNALL</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_114.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_116.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
