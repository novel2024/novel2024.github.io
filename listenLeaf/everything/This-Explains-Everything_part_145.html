You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd give species with small ranges a break‚Äîand make them locally common. Not so. Widespread species tend to be common everywhere, while local ones are rare even where you find them.</p><p>What inspired Darwin and Wallace were encounters with places rich in birds and mammals found nowhere else‚Äîthe Galapagos and the islands of Southeast Asia. There are no such places in Europe. Darwin spent most of HMS Beagle‚Äôs voyage too far south in South America, while Wallace‚Äôs first trip was to the Amazon. The Amazon is very rich in species, but it is a striking example of the law that such places rarely have many species with small ranges. (I suspect this cost Wallace dearly, because his sponsors wanted novelty. He found novelty on his next trip, to the East.)</p><p>Scientists found widespread species first. Darwin and Wallace were among the first naturalists to encounter the majority of species‚Äîthose with small geographical ranges concentrated in a few places. Even for well-known groups of species, those with the smallest ranges have been discovered only in the last decades.</p><p>What deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation underpins these ineluctably connected laws? There isn‚Äôt one.</p><p>Given the observed distribution of range sizes, the tropics have to have more species simply because they are in the middle of the globe. Sufficiently large ranges must span the middle‚Äîthat‚Äôs the only way to fit them in. But they need not be at the ends‚Äîtemperate or arctic places. Yet middles have more species than ends even when the middles aren‚Äôt tropical. There are more species in the middle of Madagascar‚Äôs wet forests, though the northern end (with fewer species) is closer to the equator, for example.</p><p>Moreover, warm, wet middles‚Äîtropical moist forests‚Äîhave more species than hotter and drier middles. The correlation of species with warmth and wetness is compelling, but a compelling mechanism is sometimes an illusion.</p><p>Small-ranged species can be anywhere‚Äînear middles or near ends. They are not. They tend to be on islands (the Galapagos, the Malaysian archipelago), and on ‚Äúhabitat islands‚Äù‚Äîmountaintops, like the Andes. This fits our ideas on how species form. Alas, they are not on temperate islands and mountains, so Darwin and Wallace had to leave home to be inspired. Except for salamanders: The Appalachians of the Eastern United States seem to have different species under every rock, forming a theoretically obstinate temperate center of endemism unmatched by birds, mammals, plants, or, indeed, other amphibians.</p><p>To make matters worse, all this assumes that we know why some species have large ranges and more have small. We do not. In short, we have correlations, special cases, and some special pleading, but elegance is missing. A deep explanation need not be there, of course.</p><p>Our ignorance hurts. Concentrations of local, rare species are where human actions drive species to extinction 100 to 1,000 times faster than the natural rate. Yes, we can map birds and mammals and so know where we need to act to save them. But not butterflies, which people love, let alone nematodes. Without explanations, we cannot tell whether the places where we protect birds will also protect butterflies. Unless we understand Mother Nature‚Äôs laws and extend them to the great majority of species still unknown to science, we may never know what we destroyed.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_144.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_146.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
