The beauty and the simplicity of his explanation is astonishing. I am sure that others have pointed out Darwinian natural selection as their favorite deep, elegant, beautiful explanation, but I still want to emphasize the general reach of Darwin‚Äôs central intuition, which goes well beyond the monumental result of having clarified that we share the same ancestors with all living beings on Earth and is directly relevant to the core of the entire scientific enterprise.</p><p>Shortly after the ancient Greek physicists started developing naturalistic explanations of nature, a general objection arose. The objection is well articulated in Plato‚Äîfor instance, in the Phaedo‚Äîand especially in Aristotle‚Äôs discussion of the theory of the ‚Äúcauses.‚Äù Naturalistic explanations rely on what Aristotle called ‚Äúthe efficient cause‚Äù‚Äînamely, past phenomena producing effects. But the world appears to be dominated by phenomena that can be understood in terms of ‚Äúfinal causes‚Äù‚Äîthat is, an ‚Äúaim‚Äù or a ‚Äúpurpose.‚Äù These are evident in the kingdom of life. We have mouths ‚Äúso‚Äù we can eat. The importance of this objection cannot be underestimated. It brought down ancient naturalism, and in the minds of many it is still the principal source of psychological resistance to a naturalistic understanding of the world.</p><p>Darwin discovered the spectacularly simple mechanism by which efficient causes produce phenomena that appear to be governed by final causes. Anytime we have phenomena that can reproduce, the actual phenomena we observe are those that keep reproducing and therefore are necessarily better at reproducing, and we can thus read them in terms of final causes. In other words, a final cause can be effective for understanding the world because it‚Äôs a shortcut in accounting for the past history of a continuing phenomenon.</p><p>To be sure, this idea has appeared before. Empedocles speculated that the apparent finality in the living kingdom could be the result of selected randomness, and Aristotle himself, in his Physics, mentions a version of this idea for species (‚Äúseeds‚Äù). But the times were not yet ripe and the suggestion was lost in the following religious ages. I think the resistance to Darwin is not just difficulty in seeing the power of a spectacularly beautiful explanation but fear of realizing the extraordinary power such an explanation has in shattering old worldviews.</p><p>THE OVERDUE DEMISE OF MONOGAMY</p><p>AUBREY DE GREY</p><p>Gerontologist; chief science officer, SENS Foundation; author, Ending Aging</p><p>There are many persuasive arguments from evolutionary biology explaining why various species, notably Homo sapiens, have adopted a lifestyle in which males and females pair up long-term. But my topic here is not one of those explanations. Instead, it is the explanation for why we are close‚Äîfar closer than most people, even most readers of Edge, yet appreciate‚Äîto the greatest societal, as opposed to technological, advance in the history of civilization.</p><p>In 1971, the American philosopher John Rawls coined the term ‚Äúreflective equilibrium‚Äù to denote ‚Äúa state of balance or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular judgments.‚Äù* In practical terms, reflective equilibrium is about how we identify and resolve logical inconsistencies in our prevailing moral compass. Examples such as the rejection of slavery and of innumerable ‚Äúisms‚Äù (sexism, ageism, etc.) are quite clear: The arguments that worked best were those highlighting the hypocrisy of maintaining acceptance of existing attitudes in the face of already established contrasting attitudes in matters that were indisputably analogous.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_36.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_38.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
