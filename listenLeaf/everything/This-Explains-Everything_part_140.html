While inbreeding is generally seen as undesirable, the debate has become much more nuanced in recent years. Purging of genes with seriously damaging effects carries obvious benefits, and this can happen when a population is inbred. Outcrossing, which is usually perceived as advantageous, does carry the possibility that the benefits of purging are undone by introducing new harmful genes into a population. Furthermore, a population adapted to one environment may not do well if crossed with a population adapted to another. So a balance is often struck between inbreeding and outbreeding.</p><p>When the life history of a species demands careful nurturing of the offspring, the parents may go to a lot of trouble to mate with the best partner possible. A mate should be not too similar to oneself, but not too dissimilar either. Japanese quail of both sexes prefer first cousins as partners. Subsequent animal studies have suggested that an optimal degree of relatedness is most beneficial to the organism in terms of reproductive success. A study of a human Icelandic population also points to the same conclusion. Couples who are third or fourth cousins have a larger number of grandchildren than more closely or more distantly related partners. Much evidence from humans and nonhuman animals suggests that the choice of a mate depends on experiences in early life, with individuals tending to choose partners who are a bit different but not too different from familiar individuals, who are usually but not always close kin.</p><p>The role of early experience in determining sexual and social preferences bears on a well-known finding that humans are extremely loyal to members of their own group. They are even prepared to give up their own lives in defense of those with whom they identify. In sharp contrast, they can behave with lethal aggressiveness toward those who are unfamiliar to them. This suggests, then, a hopeful resolution to the racism and intolerance that bedevils many societies. As people from different countries and ethnic backgrounds become better acquainted with one another, they will be more likely to treat one another well, particularly if the familiarity starts at an early age. If familiarity leads to marriage, the couples may have fewer grandchildren, but that may be a blessing on an overpopulated planet. This optimistic principle, generated by knowledge of how a balance has been struck between inbreeding and outbreeding, subverts biology‚Äîbut it does hold, for me, considerable beauty.</p><p>SEX AT YOUR FINGERTIPS</p><p>SIMON BARON-COHEN</p><p>Psychologist; director, Autism Research Centre, Cambridge University; author, The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty</p><p>We all know males and females are different below the neck. There‚Äôs growing evidence that there are differences above the neck, too. Looking into the mind reveals that, on average, females develop empathy faster‚Äîand, on average, males develop stronger interests in systems, or how things work. These are differences not so much in ability as in cognitive style and patterns of interest. They shouldn‚Äôt stand in the way of achieving equal opportunities in society or equal representation in all disciplines and fields, but such political aspirations are a separate issue from the scientific observation of cognitive differences.</p><p>Looking into the brain also reveals differences. For example, whereas males, on average, have larger brain volume than females, even correcting for height and weight, females on average reach their peak volume of gray and white matter at least a year earlier than males. There‚Äôs also a difference in the number of neurons in the neocortex: On average, males have 23 million and females 19 million, a 16 percent difference. Looking at other brain regions also shows sex differences: For example, males, on average, have a larger amygdala (an emotion area) and females, on average, a larger planum temporale (a language area). But in all this talk about sex differences, ultimately what we want to know is what gives rise to these differences, and here is where I, at least, enjoy some deep, elegant, and beautiful explanations.</p><p>My favorite is fetal testosterone, since extra drops of this special molecule seem to have ‚Äúmasculinizing‚Äù effects on the development of the brain and the mind. The credit for this simple idea must go to Charles Phoenix and colleagues at the University of Kansas who proposed it in 1959* and to Norman Geschwind and Albert Galaburda at Harvard, who picked it up in the early 1980s. This is not the only masculinizing mechanism (another is the X chromosome), but it is one that has been elegantly dissected.</p><p>However, scientists who study the causal properties of fetal testosterone sometimes resort to unethical animal experiments. Take, for example, a part of the amygdala called the medial posterodorsal (MePD) nucleus, which is larger in male rats than in females. If you castrate the poor male rat (thereby depriving him of the main source of his testosterone), the MePD shrinks to the female volume in just four weeks. Or you can do the reverse experiment, giving extra testosterone to a female rat, which makes her MePD grow to the same size as a typical male rat, again in just four weeks.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_139.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_141.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
