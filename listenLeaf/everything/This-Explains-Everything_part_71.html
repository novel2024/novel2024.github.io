But since other Edge respondents are likely to have natural selection as their favorite deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation (it has all three attributes, in addition to wide-ranging explanatory power), I‚Äôll home in on one particular instance: the explanation of how humans acquired language, by which I mean grammatical structure.</p><p>There is evidence to suggest that our ancestors developed effective means to communicate using verbal utterances starting at least 3 million years ago. But grammar is much more recent, perhaps as recent as 75,000 years ago. How did grammar arise?</p><p>Anyone who has traveled abroad knows that to communicate basic needs, desires, and intentions to people in your vicinity concerning objects within sight, a few referring words together with gestures suffice. The only grammar required is to occasionally juxtapose two words (‚ÄúMe Tarzan, you Jane‚Äù being the information- [and innuendo-] rich classic example from Hollywood). Anthropologists refer to such a simple word-pairing communication system as protolanguage.</p><p>But to communicate about things not in the here-and-now, you need more. Effectively planning future joint activities needs pretty well all of grammatical structure, particularly if the planning involves more than two people‚Äîwith even more demands made on the grammar if the plan requires coordination among groups not all present at the same place or time.</p><p>Given the degree to which human survival depends on our ability to plan and coordinate our actions and to collectively debrief after things go wrong so we avoid repeating our mistakes, it‚Äôs clear that grammatical structure is hugely important to Homo sapiens. Indeed, many argue that it‚Äôs our defining characteristic. But communication, while arguably the killer app for grammar, clearly cannot be what put it into the gene pool in the first place, and for a very simple reason. Since grammar is required in order for verbal utterances to convey ideas more complex than is possible with protolanguage, it comes into play only when the brain can form such ideas. These considerations lead to what is accepted (although not without opposition) as the Standard Explanation of language acquisition. In highly simplified terms, the Standard Explanation runs like this.</p><p>Brains (or the organs that became brains) first evolved to associate motor responses to sensory input stimuli.</p><p>In some creatures, brains became more complex, performing a mediating role between input stimuli and motor responses.</p><p>In some of those creatures, the brain became able to override automatic stimulus-response sequences.</p><p>In Homo sapiens, and to a lesser extent in other species, the brain acquired the ability to function off-line, effectively running simulations of actions without the need for sensory input stimuli and without generating output responses.</p><p>Stage 4 is when the brain acquires grammar. What we call grammatical structure is in fact a descriptive/communicative manifestation of a mental structure for modeling the world.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_70.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_72.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
