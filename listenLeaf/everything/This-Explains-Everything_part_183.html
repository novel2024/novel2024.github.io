That is, many distribution curves take on the form of a curve that swoops down from a central peak to have a long tail that asymptotically hugs the horizontal axis.</p><p>Inverse power laws are elegantly simple and deeply mysterious, but more galling than beautiful. Inverse power laws are self-organizing and self-maintaining. For reasons that aren‚Äôt entirely understood, they emerge spontaneously in a wide range of parallel computations, both social and natural.</p><p>One of the first social scientists to notice an inverse power law was the philologist George Kingsley Zipf, who formulated an observation now known as Zipf‚Äôs Law. This is the statistical fact that in most documents the frequency with which a given word is used is roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the word‚Äôs popularity rank. Thus, the second most popular word is used half as much as the most popular word, the tenth most popular word is used a tenth as much as the most popular word, and so on.</p><p>In society, similar kinds of inverse power laws govern society‚Äôs rewards. Speaking as an author, I‚Äôve noticed, for instance, that the hundredth most popular author sells a hundredfold fewer books than the author at the top. If the top writer sells a million copies, somone like me might sell 10,000.</p><p>Disgruntled scribes sometimes fantasize about a utopian marketplace in which the naturally arising inverse-power-law distribution would be forcibly replaced by a linear distribution‚Äîthat is, a sales schedule that lies along a smoothly sloping line instead of taking the form of the present bent curve that starts at an impudently high peak and swoops down to dawdle along the horizontal axis.</p><p>But there‚Äôs no obvious way that the authors‚Äô sales curve could be changed. Certainly there‚Äôs no hope of having some governing group try to force a different distribution. After all, people make their own choices as to what books to read. Society is a parallel computation, and some aspects of it are beyond control.</p><p>The inverse-power-law aspects of income distribution are particularly disturbing. Thus the second wealthiest person in a society might own half as much as the richest, with the tenth richest person possessing only a tenth as much, and‚Äîout in the ‚Äôburbs‚Äîthe thousandth richest person is making only one-thousandth as much as the person on the top.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_182.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_184.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
