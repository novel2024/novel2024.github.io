Consider the laudable but now somewhat tarnished initiative to establish evidence-based policymaking. What went wrong? All too often, objective evidence was taken to be data uncontaminated by the bias of a prior theory. But without ‚Äúthe very soul‚Äù of a theory as guidance, what constitutes evidence? Objectivity isn‚Äôt to do with stripping out all presuppositions. Indeed, the more that‚Äôs considered possible or desirable, the greater the undetected, uncriticized presuppositions and the less the objectivity. At worst, a desired but unstated goal can be smuggled in at the outset. And the upshot? This well-meant approach is often justifiably derided as ‚Äúpolicy-based evidence-making.‚Äù</p><p>An egregious example from my own recent experience, which still has me reeling with dismay, was from a researcher on ‚Äúgender diversity‚Äù whose concern was discrimination against women in the professions. He claimed that his research was absolutely free of any prior assumptions about male/female differences and that it was therefore entirely neutral and unbiased. If any patterns of differences emerged from the data, his neutral, unbiased assumption would be that they were the result of discrimination. So might he accept that evolved sex differences exist? Yes, if it were proven. And what might such a proof look like? Here he fell silent, at a loss‚Äîunsurprisingly, given that his ‚Äúneutral‚Äù hypotheses had comprehensively precluded such differences at the start. What irony, that in the purported interests of scientific objectivity he ostensibly felt justified in clearing the decks of the entire wealth of current scientific findings.</p><p>The Darwin-Popper insight, in spite of its beauty, has yet to attract the admirers it deserves.</p><p>THOMPSON ON DEVELOPMENT</p><p>PAUL BLOOM</p><p>Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor of Psychology & Cognitive Science, Yale University; author, How Pleasure Works</p><p>‚ÄúEverything is the way it is because it got that way.‚Äù This aphorism is attributed to the biologist and classicist D‚ÄôArcy Thompson, and it‚Äôs an elegant summary of how Thompson sought to explain the shapes of things, from jellyfish to sand dunes to elephant tusks. I saw this quoted first in an Edge discussion by Daniel Dennett, who made the point that this insight applies to explanation more generally‚Äîall sciences are, to at least some extent, historical sciences.</p><p>I think it‚Äôs a perfect motto for my own field of developmental psychology. Every adult mind has two histories. There is evolution; few would doubt that some of the most elegant and persuasive explanations in psychology appeal to the constructive process of natural selection. And there is development‚Äîhow our minds unfold over time, the processes of maturation and learning.</p><p>While evolutionary explanations work best for explaining what humans share, development can sometimes capture how we differ. This may be obvious: Nobody is surprised to hear that adults who are fluent in Korean have usually been exposed to Korean when they were children, or that adults who practice Judaism have usually been raised as Jews. But other developmental explanations are rather interesting.</p><p>There is evidence that an adult‚Äôs inability to see in stereo is due to poor vision during a critical period in childhood. Some have argued that the self-confidence of adult males is influenced by how young they were when they reached puberty (because of the boost in status caused by being bigger, even if temporarily, than their peers). It has been claimed that smarter adults are more likely to be firstborns (because later children find themselves in environments that are, on average, less intellectually sophisticated). Creative adults are more likely to be later-borns (because they were forced to find their own distinctive niches). Romantic attachments in adults are influenced by their relationships as children with their parents. A man‚Äôs pain-sensitivity is influenced by whether or not he was circumcised as a baby.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_93.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_95.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
