From its founding through 1996, the club held its meetings in Chinese restaurants, artists‚Äô lofts, the boardrooms of investment-banking firms, ballrooms, museums, and living rooms, among other venues. The Reality Club differed from the Algonquin Round Table, the Apostles, and the Bloomsbury Group, but it offered the same quality of intellectual adventure. Perhaps the closest resemblance was to the late 18th- and early 19th-century Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal gathering of the leading cultural figures of the new industrial age‚ÄîJames Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Priestley, Benjamin Franklin. In a similar fashion, the Reality Club was an attempt to gather together those people exploring the themes of the post‚ÄìIndustrial Age.</p><p>In 1997, the Reality Club went online, rebranded as Edge. The ideas presented on Edge are speculative; they represent the frontiers in such areas as evolutionary biology, genetics, computer science, neurophysiology, psychology, cosmology, and physics. Emerging out of these contributions is a new natural philosophy, new ways of understanding physical systems, new ways of thinking that call into question many of our basic assumptions.</p><p>For each of the anniversary editions of Edge, I and a number of Edge stalwarts, including Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and George Dyson, get together to plan the annual Edge Question‚Äîusually one that comes to one or another of us or our correspondents in the middle of the night. It‚Äôs not easy coming up with a question. (As the late James Lee Byars, my friend and sometime collaborator, used to say: ‚ÄúI can answer the question, but am I bright enough to ask it?‚Äù) We look for questions that inspire unpredictable answers‚Äîthat provoke people into thinking thoughts they normally might not have. For this year‚Äôs question, our thanks go, once again, to Steven Pinker.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest pleasure in science comes from theories that derive the solution to some deep puzzle from a small set of simple principles in a surprising way. These explanations are called ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù or ‚Äúelegant.‚Äù Historical examples are Kepler‚Äôs explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Niels Bohr‚Äôs explanation of the periodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and James Watson and Francis Crick‚Äôs explanation of genetic replication via the double helix. The great theoretical physicist P. A. M. Dirac famously said that ‚Äúit is more important to have beauty in one‚Äôs equations than to have them fit experiment.‚Äù</p><p>The Edge Question 2012</p><p>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION?</p><p>The online response to the Edge website this year (http://edge.org/annual-question/) was enormous‚Äîsome 200 provocative (and often lengthy) discussions. What follows is necessarily an edited selection. In the spirit of Edge, the contributions presented here embrace scientific thinking in the broadest sense: as the most reliable way of gaining knowledge about anything‚Äîincluding such fields of inquiry as philosophy, mathematics, economics, history, language, and human behavior. The common thread is that a simple and nonobvious idea is proposed as the explanation for a diverse and complicated set of phenomena.</p><p>JOHN BROCKMAN</p><p>Publisher & Editor, Edge</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_31.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_33.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
