We don‚Äôt find trilobites scattered in the Devonian, Jurassic, and Eocene with nothing in between. The paper screams for an explanation of the bundled generalities of paleontology and biogeography, but the scientific community was asleep at the wheel and barely noticed. A few years later, that absence of notice forced Wallace to send his deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation to Darwin for moral support. Darwin had the same explanation, of course.</p><p>What other laws has Mother Nature given us for biological diversity?</p><p>The average geographical range of a group of species is very much larger than the median range.</p><p>The average of the geographical ranges of 1,684 species of mammals in the New World is 1.8 million km2, but half of those species have ranges smaller than 250,000 km2‚Äîa seven-to-one ratio. For the region‚Äôs three main bird groups, the ratio is five and eight times, and for amphibians, forty times. There are many species with small ranges and few with large ranges.</p><p>There are more species in the tropics than in temperate regions.</p><p>The first explorers to reach the tropics uncovered this law. Rembrandt was painting birds of paradise and marine cone shells in the early 1600s. Wallace went first to the Amazon because collecting novel species was how he earned a living.</p><p>Species with small ranges concentrate in places that typically are not where the largest numbers of species live.</p><p>This just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Surely, with more species, one should have more species with large ranges, small ranges, and everything in between. It isn‚Äôt so. Small-ranged species concentrate in some very special places. About half of all species live in a couple of dozen places that together constitute about 10 percent of the ice-free parts of the planet.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_143.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_145.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
