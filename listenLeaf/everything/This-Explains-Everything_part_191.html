At any moment there is one symbol in the machine; it is called the scanned symbol. The machine can alter the scanned symbol and its behaviour is in part determined by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect the behaviour of the machine. However the tape can be moved back and forth through the machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the machine.</p><p>An abstract machine, conceived by the mind of a genius, to solve an unsolvable problem: the decision problem. That is, for each logical formula in a theory, is it possible to decide in a finite number of steps if the formula is valid in that theory? Well, Turing shows that it‚Äôs not possible. The decision problem, or Entscheidungsproblem, was well known by mathematicians: It was the tenth on a list of unsolved problems that David Hilbert presented in 1900 to the mathematics community, thus setting most of the 20th century‚Äôs agenda for mathematical research. It asks whether there is a mechanical process realizable in a finite number of steps that can decide whether a formula is valid or not or whether a function is computable or not. Turing began by asking himself, ‚ÄúWhat does a mechanical process mean?‚Äù and his answer was that a mechanical process is a process that can be realized by a machine. Obvious, isn‚Äôt it?</p><p>He then designed a machine for each possible formula in first-order logic and for each possible recursive function of natural numbers‚Äîgiven the logical equivalence proved by G√∂del, in his incompleteness theorem, between the set of first-order-logic formulas and the set of natural numbers. And, indeed, using Turing‚Äôs simple definition, we can write down a string of 0s and 1s for each tape to describe a function, then give to the machine a list of simple instructions (move left, move right, stop) so that it writes down the demonstration of the function and then stops.</p><p>This is his Universal Turing Machine‚Äîuniversal because it can take as input any possible string of symbols describing a function and give as output its demonstration. But if you feed the Universal Turing Machine with a description of itself, it doesn‚Äôt stop; it goes on infinitely generating 0s and 1s. That‚Äôs it. The Mother of all computers, the soul of the digital age, was designed to show that not everything can be reduced to a Turing machine. There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.</p><p>A MATTER OF POETICS</p><p>RICHARD FOREMAN</p><p>Playwright and director; founder, Ontological-Hysteric Theater</p><p>Since every explanation is contingent, limited by its circumstances, and certain to be superseded by a better or momentarily more ravishing one, the favorite explanation is really a matter of poetics rather than science or philosophy. That being said, I, like everyone else, fall in ‚Äúlove‚Äù‚Äîa romantic infatuation that either passes or transforms into something else. But it is the repeated momentary ravishment that slowly shapes one, because, in a sense, one is usually falling in love with the same type again and again, and this repetition defines and shapes one‚Äôs mental character. When young, I was so shaped and oriented by what I shall now call my two favorite explanations.</p><p>I hardly remember the details (being no scientist, of course), but I remember reading about Paul Dirac‚Äôs theory of the sea of negative energy out of which popped‚Äîby a hole, an absence‚Äîthe positron, which built the world we know. I hope I have this right and haven‚Äôt made a fool of myself by misrepresenting it‚Äîbut, in a sense, that wouldn‚Äôt matter. Because this image, fueled by this explanation, energized my exploration into a new kind of theater in which (evoking a kind of negative theology) I tried, and still try, to pull an audience into the void rather than feeding it what it already feels about the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world and wants confirmed.</p><p>Shortly thereafter (this was all in the 1950s), encountering the unjustly neglected philosopher Ortega y Gasset and being sent spinning by his explanation that a human being is not a ‚Äúwhole persona‚Äù (in a world where the mantra was to become ‚Äúwell rounded‚Äù) but, as he famously put it, ‚ÄúI am myself and my circumstances‚Äù‚Äîthat is, a split creature.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_190.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_192.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
