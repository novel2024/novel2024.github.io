The software was a fraud. The reason: the pigeonhole principle.</p><p>The pigeonhole principle is a simple counting argument. It says that if you‚Äôve got n pigeons and manage to stuff them into fewer than n boxes, then at least one box must have more than one pigeon in it. As blindingly obvious as this is, it‚Äôs a powerful tool. For example, imagine that the compression software really worked as advertised and every file shrank by a factor of 20 with no loss of fidelity. Every single file 2,000 bits long would be squashed down to a mere 100 bits, and then, when the algorithm was reversed, it would expand back into its original form, unscathed.</p><p>When compressing files, you bump up against the pigeonhole principle. There are many more 2,000-bit pigeons (22000, to be exact) than 100-bit boxes (2100). If an algorithm stuffs the former into the latter, at least one box must contain multiple pigeons. Take that box‚Äîthat 100-bit file‚Äîand reverse the algorithm, expanding the file into its original 2,000-bit form. You can‚Äôt! Since there are multiple 2,000-bit files that all wind up being squashed into the same 100-bit file, the algorithm has no way of knowing which one was the true original‚Äîit can‚Äôt reverse the compression.</p><p>The pigeonhole principle puts an absolute limit on what a compression algorithm can do. It can compress some files, often dramatically, but it can‚Äôt compress them all‚Äîat least, not if you insist on perfect fidelity.</p><p>Counting arguments similar to this one have opened up entire new realms for us to explore. The German mathematician Georg Cantor used a kind of reverse pigeonhole-principle technique to show that it was impossible to fit the real numbers into boxes labeled by the integers‚Äîeven though there is an infinite number of integers. The almost unthinkable consequence was that there are different levels of infinity. The infinity of the integers is dwarfed by the infinity of the reals, which, in turn, is dwarfed by yet another infinity and another infinity on top of that . . . an infinity of infinities, all unexplored until we learned to count them.</p><p>Taking the pigeonhole principle into deep space has an even stranger consequence. A principle in physics, the holographic bound, implies that in any finite volume of space there is only a finite number of possible configurations of matter and energy. If, as cosmologists tend to believe, the universe is infinite, there is an infinite number of visible-universe-size volumes out there‚Äîenormous cosmos-size bubbles containing matter and energy. And if space is more or less homogeneous, there‚Äôs nothing particularly special about the cosmos-size bubble we live in. These assumptions, taken together, lead to a stunning conclusion. Infinite universe-size bubbles, with only a finite number of configurations of the matter and energy in each, mean that there‚Äôs not just an exact copy of our universe‚Äîand our Earth‚Äîout there; the transfinite version of the pigeonhole principle states that there‚Äôs an infinite number of copies of every (technically, ‚Äúalmost every,‚Äù which has a precise mathematical definition) possible universe. Not only are there infinite copies of you on infinite alternate Earths, there are infinite copies of countless variations on the theme: versions of you with a prehensile tail, versions of you with multiple heads, versions of you that have made a career juggling carnivorous rabbitlike animals in exchange for costume jewelry. Even something as simple as counting one, two, three can lead you to bizarre and unexpected realms.</p><p>MOORE‚ÄôS LAW</p><p>RODNEY A.
