The outcome depends on which replicators best mobilize the energy and materials necessary to copy themselves and on how rapidly they can make copies which in turn can replicate. The first aspect of the competition may be called survival, metabolism, or somatic effort; the second, replication or reproductive effort. Life at every scale, from RNA and DNA to whole organisms, implements features that execute‚Äîand constantly trade off‚Äîthese two functions.</p><p>Among life‚Äôs tradeoffs is whether to allocate resources (energy, food, risk, time) to pumping out as many offspring as possible and letting them fend for themselves or eking out fewer descendants and enhancing the chances of survival and reproduction of each one. The continuum represents the degree of parental investment expended by an organism.</p><p>Since parental investment is finite, investing organisms face a second tradeoff, between investing resources in a given offspring and conserving those resources to invest in its existing or potential siblings.</p><p>Because of the essential difference between the sexes‚Äîfemales produce fewer but more expensive gametes‚Äîthe females of most species invest more in offspring than do the males, whose investment is often close to zero. Mammalian females in particular have opted for massive investment, starting with internal gestation and lactation. In some species, including Homo sapiens, the males may invest, too, though less than the females.</p><p>Natural selection favors the allocation of resources not just from parents to offspring but among genetic kin, such as siblings and cousins. Just as a gene that encourages a parent to invest in offspring will be favoring a copy of itself that sits inside those offspring, so a gene that encourages an organism to invest in a brother or cousin will, some proportion of the time, be helping a copy of itself and will be selected in proportion to the benefits conferred, the costs incurred, and the degree of genetic relatedness.</p><p>I‚Äôve just reviewed the fundamental features of life on Earth (and possibly life everywhere), with the barest mention of contingent facts about our own species‚Äîonly that we‚Äôre mammals with male parental investment. I‚Äôll add a second: that we‚Äôre a brainy species that deals with life‚Äôs conundrums not just with fixed adaptations selected over evolutionary time but also with facultative adaptations (cognition, language, socialization) that we deploy in our lifetimes and whose products we share via culture.</p><p>From these deep principles about the nature of the evolutionary process, one can deduce a vast amount about the social life of our species. (Credit where it‚Äôs due: William Hamilton, George Williams, Robert Trivers, Donald Symons, Richard Alexander, Martin Daly, Margo Wilson.)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Conflict is a part of the human condition. Notwithstanding religious myths of Eden, romantic images of noble savages, utopian dreams of perfect harmony, and gluey metaphors like attachment, bonding, and cohesion, human life is never free of friction. All societies have some degree of differential prestige and status, inequality of power and wealth, punishment, sexual regulations, sexual jealousy, hostility to other groups, and conflict within the group, including violence, rape, and homicide. Our cognitive and moral obsessions track these conflicts. There is a small number of plots in the world‚Äôs fiction, defined by adversaries (often murderous) and tragedies of kinship or love (or both). In the real world, our life stories are largely stories of conflict: the hurts, guilts, and rivalries inflicted by friends, relatives, and competitors.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The main refuge from this conflict is the family‚Äîcollections of individuals with an evolutionary interest in one another‚Äôs flourishing. Thus we find that traditional societies are organized around kinship and that political leaders, from great emperors to tinpot tyrants, seek to transfer power to their offspring. Extreme forms of altruism, such as donating an organ or making a risky loan, are typically offered to relatives, as are bequests of wealth after death‚Äîa major cause of economic inequality. Nepotism constantly threatens social institutions such as religions, governments, and businesses that compete with the instinctive bonds of family.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Even families are not perfect havens from conflict, because the solidarity from shared genes must contend with competition over parental investment. Parents have to apportion their investment across all their children, born and unborn, with every offspring equally valuable (all else being equal). But while an offspring has an interest in its siblings‚Äô welfare, since it shares half its genes with each full sib, it shares all of its genes with itself, so it has a disproportionate interest in its own welfare. The implicit conflict plays itself out throughout the life span: in postpartum depression, infanticide, cuteness, weaning, brattiness, tantrums, sibling rivalry, and struggles over inheritance.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_47.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_49.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
