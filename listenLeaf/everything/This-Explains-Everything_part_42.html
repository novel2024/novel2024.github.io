Take, for example, our impression that symmetrical faces and bodies are beautiful. Symmetry, it turns out, is a good indicator of health and consequently of mate-worthiness. It‚Äôs a significant challenge for an organism to coordinate the production of its billions of cells so that its two sides proceed to develop as perfect matches, warding off disease and escaping injury, mutation, and malnutrition. Symmetrical female breasts, for example, are a good predictor of fertility. As our lustful genes know, the achievement of symmetry is a sign of genetic robustness; we find lopsidedness a turnoff. So, too, in regard to other components of human beauty‚Äîradiant skin, shining eyes, neotony (at least in women). The upshot is that we don‚Äôt want to mate with people because they‚Äôre beautiful; rather, they‚Äôre beautiful because we want to mate with them, and we want to mate with them because our genes are betting on them as replicators.</p><p>So, too, you might think that beauty of every sort is to be similarly explained away, an attention-grabbing epiphenomenon with no substance of its own. Which brings me to the Edge Question concerning beautiful explanations. Is there anything to this notion of explanatory beauty, a guide to choosing between explanatory alternatives, or is it just that any explanation that‚Äôs satisfactory will, for that very reason and no other, strike us as beautiful, beautifully explanatory, so that the reference to beauty is, once again, without any substance? That would be an explanation for the mysterious injection of aesthetics into science. The upshot would be that explanations aren‚Äôt satisfying because they‚Äôre beautiful; rather, they‚Äôre beautiful because they‚Äôre satisfying. They strip the phenomenon bare of all mystery and maybe, as a bonus, pull in further phenomena which can be rendered nonmysterious using the same sort of explanation. Can explanatory beauty be explained away, summarily dismissed by way of an eliminative explanation? (Eliminative explanations are beautiful.)</p><p>I‚Äôd like to stop here, with a beautiful explanation for explaining away explanatory beauty, but somebody is whispering in my ear. It‚Äôs that damned Plato. Plato is going on about how there is more in the idea of explanatory beauty than is acknowledged in the eliminative explanation. In particular, he‚Äôs insisting, as he does in his Timaeus, that the beauty of symmetry, especially as it‚Äôs expressed in the mathematics of physical laws, cannot be explained away with the legerdemain of the preceding paragraph. He‚Äôs reproaching the eliminative explanation of explanatory beauty with ignoring the many examples in history when the insistence on the beauty of symmetry led to substantive scientific progress. What was it that led James Clerk Maxwell to his four equations of electromagnetism but his trying to impose mathematical symmetry on the domains of electricity and magnetism? What was it that led Einstein to his equations of gravity but an insistence on beautiful mathematics?</p><p>Eliminative explanations are beautiful, but only when they truly and thoroughly explain. So instead of offering an answer to this year‚Äôs Edge Question, I offer instead an unresolved (and, therefore, unbeautiful) reaction to the deep question on which it rests.</p><p>PTOLEMY‚ÄôS UNIVERSE</p><p>JAMES J. O‚ÄôDONNELL</p><p>Classicist; provost, Georgetown University; author, The Ruin of the Roman Empire</p><p>Claudius Ptolemy explained the sky. He was an Egyptian who wrote in Greek in the Roman Empire, in the time of emperors like Trajan and Hadrian. His most famous book was called by its Arabic translators the Almagest. He inherited a long ancient tradition of astronomical science going back to Mesopotamia, but he put his name and imprint on the most successful and so far longest-lived mathematical description of the working of the skies.</p><p>Ptolemy‚Äôs geocentric universe is now known mainly as the thing that was rightly abandoned by Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, and Einstein, in progressive waves of the advancement of modern science, but he deserves our deep admiration. Ptolemy‚Äôs universe actually made sense. He knew the difference between planets and stars and he knew that the planets take some explaining. (The Greek word planet means ‚Äúwanderer,‚Äù to reflect ancient puzzlement that those bright lights moved according to no pattern that a shepherd or seaman could intuitively predict, unlikely the reassuringly confident annual march of Orion or the rotation of the great bears overhead.) So Ptolemy represents the heavenly machine in a complex mathematical system most notorious for its ‚Äúepicycles‚Äù‚Äîthe orbits within orbits, so to speak, by which the planets, while orbiting the Earth, spun off their orbits in smaller circles that explained their seeming forward and backward motion in the night sky.</p><p>We should admire Ptolemy for many reasons, but chief among them is this: He did his job seriously and responsibly with the tools he had. Given what he knew, his system was brilliantly conceived, mathematically sound, and a huge advance over what had gone before. His observations were patient and careful and as complete as could be, his mathematical calculations correct. More, his mathematical system was as complicated as it needed to be and at the same time as simple as it could be, given what he had to work with. He was, in short, a real scientist. He set the standard.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_41.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_43.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
