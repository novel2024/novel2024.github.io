Could the features of MetSyn be the adaptive response to inadequate energy? After all, fat depots, glucose, and triglycerides are each accessory energy sources (oxygen is primary); blood pressure is needed to deliver these to tissues, especially when underperfused. Cell energy, central to cell and organism survival, is needed continuously; we live only minutes without oxygen. The stretch is not so great: Populations in which prior generations were energy-starved now have increased obesity/MetSyn, and low energy supply in utero is understood to foster MetSyn in adulthood.</p><p>This explains, as the energy-surfeit view does not, why MetSyn exists at all: why elevated glucose, triglycerides, blood pressure (carrying oxygen, glucose, nutrients), and abdominal fat deposition cohere statistically. It explains why other energy-supportive adaptations, like free fatty acids and (metabolically active) ectopic fat (fatty-liver, fatty-pancreas, fatty-kidney, even fatty-streaks in the blood vessels) accompany those Met Syn factors; why MetSyn is linked to fatigue and increased sleep duration (which conserves energy). Indeed, increased caloric intake and reduced exercise‚Äîthe usual MetSyn explanation‚Äîarise, too, as fellow energetic adaptations. Thus, this view is arguably not antithetical to the canonical one but in one sense subsumes it. It explains, as the energy-surfeit view does not, the populations at risk for MetSyn, such as the elderly (mitochondrial function declines exponentially with age) and those afflicted with sleep apnea or any cause for recurrent impairment of energy production. And it explains why, in studies focused on persons with conditions that blight energy, those with MetSyn features paradoxically don‚Äôt do worse, or even fare better.</p><p>Why, then, is MetSyn an epidemic? Numerous energy-adverse secular shifts include nutrient-poor/low-antioxidant/high-prooxidant pseudofoods (nutrients are needed for energy-production machinery, and antioxidants protect from oxidative stress, whose chief target is mitochondria, the energy-producing bits of cells), decline of regular balanced meals, and hypoglycemic-promoting macronutrient composition (simple carbohydrates without fat or protein engender unopposed insulin surges, and glucose drops). But a central factor is the explosion in our environment of oxidative stressors that disrupt function of (and DNA in) mitochondria.
