And as we age, scientists report, these epigenetic processes continue to modify and build who we are. Fifty-year-old twins, for example, show three times more epigenetic modifications than do three-year-old twins; and twins reared apart show more epigenetic alterations than those who grow up together. Epigenetic investigations are proving that genes are not destiny; but neither is the environment‚Äîeven in people.</p><p>Shelley Taylor has shown this. Studying an allele (genetic variant) in the serotonin system, she and colleagues showed that the symptoms of depression are visible only when this allele is expressed in combination with specific environmental conditions. Moreover, Taylor maintains that individuals growing up in unstable households are likely to suffer all their lives with depression, anxiety, specific cancers, heart disease, diabetes, or obesity.* Epigenetics at work? Probably.</p><p>Even more remarkable, some epigenetic instructions are passed from one generation to the next. Transgenerational epigenetic modifications are now documented in plants and fungi and have been suggested in mice. Genes are like the keys on a piano; epigenetic processes direct how these keys are played‚Äîmodifying the tune, even passing these modifications to future generations. Indeed, in 2010, scientists wrote in Science magazine that epigenetic systems are now regarded as heritable, self-perpetuating, and reversible.</p><p>If epigenetic mechanisms can not only modulate our intellectual and physical abilities but also pass these alterations on to our descendants, epigenetics has immense and profound implications for the origin, evolution, and future of life on Earth. In coming decades, scientists studying epigenetics may understand how myriad environmental forces affect our health and longevity in specific ways, find cures for many human diseases and conditions, and explain intricate variations in human personality.</p><p>The 17th-century philosopher John Locke was convinced that the human mind is a blank slate upon which the environment inscribes personality. With equal self-assurance, others have been convinced that genes orchestrate our development, illnesses, and lifestyles. Yet social scientists failed for decades to explain the mechanisms governing behavioral variations between twins and among family members and culture groups. And biological scientists failed to pinpoint the genetic foundations of many mental illnesses and complex diseases. The central mechanism to explain these complex issues has been found.</p><p>I am hardly the first to hail this new field of biology as revolutionary‚Äîthe fundamental process by which nature and nurture interact. But to me, as an anthropologist long trying to take a middle road in a scientific discipline intractably immersed in nature-versus-nurture warfare, epigenetics is the missing link.</p><p>FLOCKING BEHAVIOR IN BIRDS</p><p>JOHN NAUGHTON</p><p>Newspaper columnist; vice-president, Wolfson College, Cambridge; author, From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet</p><p>My favorite explanation is Craig Reynolds‚Äôs suggestion (first published in 1987) that flocking behavior in birds can be explained by assuming that each bird follows three simple rules: separation (don‚Äôt crowd your neighbors), alignment (steer toward the average heading of your neighbors), and cohesion (steer toward the average position of your neighbors).* That such complex behavior can be accounted for in such a breathtakingly simple way is, well, just beautiful.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_102.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_104.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
