They argue that as time becomes worth more and more money, time is seen as scarcer. Scarcity and value are perceived as conjoined twins; when a resource‚Äîfrom diamonds to drinking water‚Äîis scarce, it is more valuable, and vice versa. So when our time becomes more valuable, we feel as though we had less of it. Surveys around the world have shown that people with higher incomes report feeling more pressed for time‚Äîthough there are other plausible reasons for this, including the fact that the affluent often work longer hours, leaving them with less free time.</p><p>DeVoe and Pfeffer proposed, however, that simply perceiving oneself as affluent might be sufficient to generate feelings of time pressure. Going beyond past correlational analyses, they used controlled experiments to put this causal explanation to the test.* In one experiment, DeVoe and Pfeffer asked 128 undergraduates to report the total amount of money they had in the bank. All the students answered the question using an 11-point scale, but for half the students, the scale was divided into $50 increments, ranging from $0‚Äì$50 to over $500, whereas for the others the scale was divided into much larger increments, ranging from $0‚Äì$500 to over $400,000. Most undergraduates using the $50-increment scale circled a number near the top, leaving them with the sense that they were relatively well-off. And this seemingly trivial manipulation led them to feel that they were rushed, pressed for time, and stressed out. Just feeling affluent led students to experience the same sense of time pressure reported by genuinely affluent individuals. Using other methods, researchers have confirmed that increasing the perceived economic value of time increases its perceived scarcity.</p><p>If feelings of time-scarcity stem in part from the sense that time is highly valuable, then one of the best things we can do to reduce this sense of pressure may be to give our time away. Indeed, new research suggests that giving time away to help others can actually alleviate feelings of time pressure. Companies like Home Depot provide their employees with opportunities to volunteer their time to help others, potentially reducing feelings of time stress and burnout. And Google encourages employees to use 20 percent of their time on their own pet projects, whether or not these have payoff potential. Although some of them resulted in economically valuable products, like Gmail, the greatest value of this program might lie in reducing employees‚Äô sense that their time is scarce.</p><p>DeVoe and Pfeffer‚Äôs work can help account for important cultural trends. Over the past fifty years, feelings of time pressure have risen dramatically in North America, despite the fact that weekly hours of work have stayed fairly level and weekly hours of leisure have climbed. This apparent paradox may be explained in no small part by the fact that incomes have increased substantially during the same period. This causal effect may also help to explain why people walk faster in wealthy cities like Tokyo and Toronto than they do in cities like Nairobi and Jakarta. And at the level of the individual, this explanation suggests that as incomes grow over the course of one‚Äôs life, time seems increasingly scarce. Which means that as my career develops, I might have to force myself to take those turns a little slower.</p><p>WHY THE SUN STILL SHINES</p><p>BART KOSKO</p><p>Professor of electrical engineering and law, University of Southern California; author, Noise</p><p>One of the deepest explanations has to be why the sun still shines‚Äîand thus why the sun has not long since burned out, as do the fires of everyday life. That had to worry some of the sun gazers of old as they watched campfires and forest fires burn through their life cycles. It worried the 19th-century scientists who knew that gravity alone could not account for the likely long life of the sun.</p><p>It sure worried me when I first thought about it as a child.</p><p>The explanation of hydrogen atoms fusing into helium was little comfort. It came at the height of the duck-and-cover cold-war paranoia in the early 1960s after my father had built part of the basement of our new house into a nuclear bomb shelter. The one-room shelter came complete with reinforced concrete and metal windows and a deep freezer packed with homemade TV dinners. The sun burned so long and so brightly because there were in effect so many mushroom-cloud-producing thermonuclear hydrogen-bomb explosions going off inside it and because there was so much hydrogen-bomb-making material in the sun. The explosions were just like the hydrogen bomb explosions that could scorch the Earth and even incinerate the little bomb shelter if they went off close enough.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_107.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_109.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
