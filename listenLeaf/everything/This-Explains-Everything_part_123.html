If you try, however, you will find that you can continue rotating the ball keeping your palm up by raising your upper arm and bending your elbow so that your forearm sticks straight forward. The ball has now rotated by 360Àö‚Äîone full rotation. If you‚Äôve done everything right, however, your arm should be crooked in a maximally painful and awkward position.</p><p>To relieve the pain, continue rotating by an additional 90Àö to one-and-a-quarter turns, palm up all the time. The ball should now be hovering over your head, and the painful tension in your shoulder should be somewhat lessened.</p><p>Finally, like a waiter presenting a tray containing the pi√®ce de resistance, continue the motion for the final three-quarters of a turn, ending with the ball and your arm (what a relief!) back in its original position.</p><p>If you have managed to perform these steps correctly and without personal damage, you will find that the trajectory of the ball has traced out a kind of twisty figure eight, or infinity sign (‚àû), in space and has rotated around not once but twice. The true symmetry of space is not rotation by 360Àö but by 720Àö.</p><p>Although this exercise might seem no more than a fancy and painful basketball move, the fact that the true symmetry of space is rotation not once but twice has profound consequences for the nature of the physical world at its most microscopic level. It implies that ‚Äúballs,‚Äù such as electrons, attached to a distant point by flexible and deformable ‚Äústrings,‚Äù such as magnetic field lines, must be rotated around twice to return to their original configuration. Digging deeper, the twofold rotational nature of spherical symmetry implies that two electrons, both spinning in the same direction, cannot be placed in the same place at the same time. This exclusion principle in turn underlies the stability of matter. If the true symmetry of space were rotating around only once, then all the atoms of your body would collapse into nothingness in a tiny fraction of a second. Fortunately, however, the true symmetry of space consists of rotating around twice, and your atoms are stable, a fact that should console you as you ice your shoulder.</p><p>THE PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE REVISITED</p><p>CHARLES SEIFE</p><p>Professor of journalism, New York University; former writer, Science; author, Proofiness: The Dark Arts of Mathematical Deception</p><p>Sometimes even the simple act of counting can tell you something profound. One day, back in the late 1990s, when I was a correspondent for New Scientist magazine, I got an e-mail from a flack waxing rhapsodic about an extraordinary piece of software. It was a revolutionary data-compression program so efficient it would squash every digital file by 95 percent or more without losing a single bit of data. Wouldn‚Äôt my magazine jump at the chance to tell the world about the computer program that would make hard drives hold twenty times more information than before?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_122.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_124.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
