That, in turn, would create a constantly changing electric field, which would create a constantly changing magnetic field, and so on. This field ‚Äúdisturbance‚Äù would move out from the original source (the jiggling charge) at a rate that Maxwell could calculate on the basis of his equations. The parameters in these equations came from experiment‚Äîfrom measuring the strength of the electric force between two known charges and the strength of the magnetic force between two known currents.</p><p>From these two fundamental properties of nature, Maxwell calculated the speed of the disturbance and found out that the speed was precisely the speed that light was measured to have! Thus he discovered that light is indeed a wave‚Äîbut a wave of electric and magnetic fields that moves through space at a precise speed determined by two fundamental constants in nature. This laid the basis for Einstein to come along a generation or so later and demonstrate that the constant speed of light required a revision in our notions of space and time.</p><p>So, from jumping frogs and differential equations came one of the most beautiful unifications in all of physics: the unification of electricity and magnetism in a single theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell‚Äôs theory explained the existence of that which allows us to observe the universe around us‚Äînamely, light. Its practical implications would produce the mechanisms that power modern civilization and the principles that govern essentially all modern electronic devices. And the nature of the theory itself produced a series of further puzzles that allowed Einstein to come up with new insights into space and time!</p><p>Not bad for a set of experiments whose worth was questioned by Gladstone (or by Queen Victoria, depending on which apocryphal story you buy), who came into Faraday‚Äôs laboratory and wondered what all the fuss was about and what use all of this experimentation was. He (or she) was told either ‚ÄúOf what use is a newborn baby?‚Äù or, in my favorite version of the story, ‚ÄúUse? Why, one day this will be so useful you will tax us for it!‚Äù Beauty, elegance, depth, utility, adventure, and excitement! Science at its best!</p><p>FURRY RUBBER BANDS</p><p>NEIL GERSHENFELD</p><p>Director, Center for Bits and Atoms, MIT; author, Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop‚Äîfrom Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication</p><p>I learned electrodynamics at Swarthmore, from Professor Mark Heald and his concise text on an even more concise set of equations, Maxwell‚Äôs. In four lines, just thirty-one characters (or fewer, with some notational tricks), Maxwell‚Äôs equations unified what had appeared to be unrelated phenomena (the dynamics of electric and magnetic fields), predicted new experimental observations, and contained both theoretical advances to come (including the wave solution for light and special relativity) and technologies to come (including the fiberoptics, coaxial cables, and wireless signals that carry the Internet).</p><p>But the explanation I found memorable was not Maxwell‚Äôs of electromagnetism, which is well known for its beauty and consequence. It was Heald‚Äôs explanation that electric field lines behave like furry rubber bands: They want to be as short as possible (the rubber) but don‚Äôt want to be near each other (the fur). This is an easily understood, qualitative description that has served me in good stead in device design. And it provides a deeper quantitative insight into the nature of Maxwell‚Äôs equations: The local solution for the field geometry can be understood as solving a global optimization.</p><p>These sorts of scientific similarities that are predictive as well as descriptive help us reason about regimes our minds didn‚Äôt evolve to operate in. Unifying forces is not an everyday occurrence, but explaining them can be. Recognizing that something is precisely like something else is a kind of object-oriented thinking that helps build bigger thoughts out of smaller ideas.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_167.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_169.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
