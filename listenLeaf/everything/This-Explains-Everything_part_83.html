It is primordially magnificent. But elegant is not the word I‚Äôd use to describe the explanation I just sketched out. Scientists did not derive it from first principles. There is no equivalent of e = mc2 that predicts how the complex violence of the early solar system produced a watery planet that could support life. In fact, the only reason we now know so much about how the Earth formed is because geologists freed themselves from a seductively elegant explanation that was foisted on them 150 years ago. It was unquestionably beautiful, and stunningly wrong.</p><p>The explanation was the work of one of the greatest physicists of the 19th century, William Thomson (aka Lord Kelvin). Kelvin‚Äôs accomplishments ranged from the concrete (figuring out how to lay a telegraph cable from Europe to America) to the abstract (the first and second laws of thermodynamics). Kelvin spent much of his career writing equations that could let him calculate how fast hot things got cold. He realized that he could use these equations to estimate how old the Earth is. ‚ÄúThe mathematical theory on which these estimates are founded is very simple,‚Äù Kelvin declared when he unveiled it in 1862.*</p><p>At the time, scientists generally agreed that the Earth had started out as a ball of molten rock and had been cooling ever since. Such a birth would explain why rocks are hot at the bottom of mine shafts: The surface of the Earth was the first part to cool, and ever since, the remaining heat inside the planet had been flowing out into space. Kelvin reasoned that over time the planet should steadily grow cooler. He used his equations to calculate how long it should take for a molten sphere of rock to cool to Earth‚Äôs current temperature, with its observed rate of heat flow. His verdict was a brief 98 million years.</p><p>Geologists howled in protest. They didn‚Äôt know how old the Earth was, but they thought in billions of years, not millions. Charles Darwin‚Äîwho was a geologist first and a biologist later‚Äîestimated that it had taken 300 million years for a valley in England to erode into its current shape. The Earth itself, Darwin argued, was far older. And when he published his theory of evolution he took it for granted that the Earth was inconceivably old; the luxury of time provided room for evolution to work slowly and imperceptibly.</p><p>Kelvin didn‚Äôt care. His explanation was so elegant, so beautiful, so simple, that it had to be right. It didn‚Äôt matter how much trouble it caused for other scientists who were ignoring thermodynamics. In fact, Kelvin made even more trouble for geologists when he took another look at his equations. He decided his first estimate had been too generous. The Earth might be only 10 million years old.</p><p>It turned out that Kelvin was wrong, but not because his equations were ugly or inelegant. They were flawless. The problem lay in the model of the Earth to which Kelvin applied his equations.</p><p>The story of Kelvin‚Äôs refutation got a bit garbled in later years. Many people (myself included) have mistakenly claimed that his error stemmed from his ignorance of radioactivity. Radioactivity was not discovered until the early 1900s, as physicists worked out quantum physics. The physicist Ernest Rutherford declared that the heat released as radioactive atoms broke down inside the Earth kept it warmer than it would be otherwise. Thus a hot Earth did not have to be a young Earth.</p><p>It‚Äôs true that radioactivity does give off heat, but there isn‚Äôt enough inside the planet to account for the heat flowing out of it. Instead, Kelvin‚Äôs real mistake was assuming that the Earth was just a solid ball of rock. In reality, the rock flows like syrup, its heat lifting it up toward the crust, where it cools and then sinks back into the depths once more. This stirring of the Earth is what causes earthquakes, drives old crust down into the depths of the planet, and creates fresh crust at ocean ridges. It also drives heat up into the crust at a much greater rate than Kelvin envisioned.</p><p>That‚Äôs not to say that radioactivity didn‚Äôt have its part to play in showing that Kelvin was wrong. Physicists realized that the tick-tock of radioactive decay created a clock they could use to estimate the age of rocks with exquisite precision. Thus we can now say that the Earth is not just billions of years old but 4.567 billion.</p><p>Elegance unquestionably plays a big part in the advancement of science. The mathematical simplicity of quantum physics is lovely to behold. But in the hands of geologists, quantum physics has brought to light the glorious, messy, and very inelegant history of our planet.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_82.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_84.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
