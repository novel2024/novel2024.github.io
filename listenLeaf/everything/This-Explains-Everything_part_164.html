KOSSLYN</p><p>Psychologist; director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University</p><p>ROBIN ROSENBERG</p><p>Clinical psychologist; author, What‚Äôs the Matter with Batman?</p><p>It‚Äôs easy to imagine a politician‚Äôs objecting to federal funds going to study how dogs drool. But failing to support such research would have been very shortsighted indeed. As part of his Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning research on digestion, the great Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849‚Äì1936) measured the amount of saliva produced when dogs were given food. In the course of this work, he and his colleagues noticed something unexpected: The dogs began salivating well before they were fed. In fact, they salivated when they first heard the approaching footsteps of the person coming to feed them. That core observation led to the discovery of classical conditioning.</p><p>The key idea behind classical conditioning is that a neutral stimulus (such as the sound of approaching footsteps) comes to be associated with a stimulus (such as food) that reflexively produces a response (such as salivation)‚Äîand after a while, the neutral stimulus elicits the response produced reflexively by the paired stimulus. To be clear about the phenomenon, we‚Äôll need to take a few words to explain the jargon. The neutral stimulus becomes ‚Äúconditioned,‚Äù and hence is known as the conditioned stimulus (CS), whereas the stimulus that reflexively produces the response is known as the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). And the response produced by the UCS is called the unconditioned response (UR). Classical conditioning occurs when the CS is presented right before a UCS, so that after a while the CS by itself produces the response. When this occurs, the response is called a conditioned response (CR). In short, at the outset a UCS (such as food) produces a UCR (such as salivation); when a CS (the sound of the feeder‚Äôs footsteps) is presented before the UCS, it soon comes to produce the response, a CR (salivation), by itself.</p><p>This simple process gives rise to a host of elegant and nonintuitive explanations.</p><p>For example, consider accidental deaths from drug overdoses. In general, narcotics users tend to take the drug in a specific setting, such as their bathroom. The setting initially is a neutral stimulus, but after someone takes narcotics in it a few times, the bathroom comes to function as a CS: As soon as the user enters the bathroom with narcotics, the user‚Äôs body responds to the setting by preparing for the ingestion of the drug. Specific physiological reactions allow the body to cope with the drug, and those reactions become conditioned to the bathroom (in other words, the reactions become a CR). To get a sufficient high, the user must now take enough of the narcotic to overcome the body‚Äôs preparation. But if the user takes the drug in a different setting, perhaps in a friend‚Äôs bedroom during a party, the CR does not occur‚Äîthat is, the usual physiological preparation for the narcotic does not take place. Thus, the usual amount of the drug functions as if it were a larger dose and may be more than the user can tolerate without the body‚Äôs preemptive readiness. Hence, although the process of classical conditioning was formulated to explain very different phenomena, it can be extended to explain why drug overdoses sometimes accidentally occur when usual doses are taken in new settings.</p><p>By the same token, classical conditioning plays a role in the placebo effect: The analgesics regularly used by many of us, such as ibuprofen or aspirin, begin to take effect well before their active ingredients have time to kick in. Why? From previous experience, the mere act of taking that particular pill has become a CS, which triggers the pain-relieving processes invoked by the medicine itself (and those processes have become a CR).</p><p>Classical conditioning also can result from an implanted defibrillator, or pacemaker. When the heart beats too quickly, this device shocks it, causing it to revert to beating at a normal rate. Until the shock level is properly calibrated, the shock can be very uncomfortable and function as a UCS, producing fear as a UCR. Because the shock does not occur in a consistent environment, the person associates random aspects of the environment with it‚Äîwhich then function as CS‚Äôs. And when any of those environmental aspects are present, the person can experience severe anxiety, awaiting the possible shock.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_163.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_165.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
