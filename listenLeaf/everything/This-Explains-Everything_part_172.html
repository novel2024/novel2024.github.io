In the summer of 2011, a group at the University of California‚ÄìBerkeley produced, by reconstructing brain-imaging activation maps, a reasonable facsimile of the short YouTube movies shown to their experiment‚Äôs subjects.* In fact, it was inspiring and downright scary to see the resemblance of the frame-by-frame comparisons of the movies and what was reconstructed from the brain imaging.</p><p>Couple this with the ongoing development of miniature portable MRIs and we may be on the way to watching our dreams in the morning on our iPad. Or, even more worrisome, revealing the movies in our brain to anyone interested in seeing them.</p><p>THE DISCONTINUITY OF SCIENCE AND CULTURE</p><p>GERALD HOLTON</p><p>Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and professor of the history of science, emeritus, Harvard University; coeditor (with Peter Galison and Silvan Schweber), Einstein for the 21st Century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture</p><p>From time to time, large sections of humanity find themselves, at short notice, in a different universe. Science, culture, and society have undergone a tectonic shift, for better or worse‚Äîthe rise of a powerful religious or political leader, the Declaration of Independence, the end of slavery‚Äîor, on the other hand, the fall of Rome, the Great Plague, the World Wars.</p><p>So, too, in the world of art. Thus Virginia Woolf said famously, ‚ÄúOn or about December 1910 human character changed,‚Äù owing, in her view, to the explosive exhibition of Post‚ÄìImpressionist canvases in London that year. And after the discovery of the nucleus was announced, Wassily Kandinsky wrote: ‚ÄúThe collapse of the atom model was equivalent, in my soul, to the collapse of the whole world. Suddenly, the thickest walls fell . . . ,‚Äù and he could turn to a new way of painting.</p><p>Each of such worldview-changing occurrences tends to be deeply puzzling or anguishing. They are sudden fissures in the familiar fabric of history that ask for explanations, with treatises published year after year, each hoping to provide an answer, seeking the cause of the dismay.</p><p>I will here focus on one such phenomenon.</p><p>In 1611, John Donne published his poem The First Anniversary, containing the familiar lines ‚ÄúAnd new Philosophy calls all in doubt, / The Element of fire is quite put out;‚Äù and later, ‚Äú . . . Is crumbled out againe to his Atomies / ‚ÄôTis all in pieces, all coherence gone; / All just supply, and all Relation.‚Äù He and many others felt that the old order and unity had been displaced by relativism and discontinuity. The explanation for his anguish was an entirely unexpected event the year before: Galileo‚Äôs discovery of the fact that the moon has mountains, that Jupiter has moons, that there are immensely more stars than had been known.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_171.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_173.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
