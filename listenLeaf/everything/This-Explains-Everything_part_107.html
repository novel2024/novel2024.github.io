All it needs is a device that can link in to the dispersal, and just as a plunging stream of water can be harnessed and used to drive construction, so the stream of dispersal can be harnessed. Overall, there is an increase in disorder as the world progresses, but locally structures, including cathedrals and brains, dinosaurs and dogs, piety and evil deeds, poetry and diatribes, can be thrown up as local abatements of chaos.</p><p>Take, for instance, an internal combustion engine. The spark results in the combustion of the hydrocarbon fuel, with the generation of smaller water and carbon dioxide molecules that tend to disperse and in so doing drive down a piston. At the same time, the energy released in the combustion spreads into the surroundings. The mechanical design of the engine harnesses these dispersals, and, through a string of gears, that harnessing can be used to build from bricks a cathedral. Thus dispersal results in a local structure, even though, overall, the world has sunk a little more into disorder.</p><p>The fuel might be our dinner, which, as it is metabolized, releases molecules and energy, which spread. The analog of the gears in a vehicle is the network of biochemical reactions within us, and instead of a pile of bricks molded into a cathedral, amino acids are joined together to generate the intricate structure of a protein. Thus, as we eat, so we grow. We, too, are local abatements of chaos driven into being by the generation of disorder elsewhere.</p><p>Is it then too fanciful to imagine intellectual creativity, or just plain inconsequential reverie, as being driven likewise? At some kind of notional rest, the brain is a hive of electric and synaptic activity. The metabolic processes driven by the digestion of food can result in the ordering not of brick into cathedral, not of amino acid into protein, but current into concept, artistic work, foolhardy decision, scientific understanding.</p><p>Even that other great principle, natural selection, can be regarded as an extraordinarily complex reticulated unwinding of the world, with the changes that take place in the biosphere and its evolution driven ultimately by descent into disorder. Is it then any wonder that I regard the second law as a great enlightenment? That from so simple a principle great consequences flow is, in my view, a criterion of the greatness of a scientific principle. No principle, I think, can be simpler than that things get worse, and no consequences greater than the universe of all activity, so surely this law is the greatest of all.</p><p>WHY WE FEEL PRESSED FOR TIME</p><p>ELIZABETH DUNN</p><p>Social psychologist, University of British Columbia</p><p>Recently I found myself on the side of the road picking gravel out of my knee and wondering how I‚Äôd ended up there. I had been biking from work to meet a friend at the gym, pedaling frantically to make up for being a few minutes behind schedule. I knew I was going too fast, and when I hit a patch of loose gravel while careening through a turn, my bike slid out from under me. How had I gotten myself in this position? Why was I in such a rush?</p><p>I thought I knew the answer. The pace of life is increasing; people are working more and relaxing less than they did fifty years ago‚Äîat least that‚Äôs the impression one gets from the popular media. But as a social psychologist, I wanted to see the data. As it turns out, there is very little evidence that people nowadays are working more and relaxing less than they did in earlier decades. In fact, some of the best studies suggest just the opposite. So why do people report feeling so pressed for time?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_106.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_108.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
