I ask whether a graviton, if it exists, could conceivably be observed.</p><p>I do not know the answer to this question, but I have one piece of evidence that the answer may be no. The evidence is the behavior of one piece of apparatus‚Äîthe gravitational-wave detector called LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) now operating in Louisiana and Washington State. The way LIGO works is to measure very accurately the distance between two mirrors by bouncing light from one to the other. When a gravitational wave comes by, the distance between the two mirrors will change very slightly. Because of ambient and instrumental noise, the actual LIGO detectors can only detect waves far stronger than a single graviton. But even in a totally quiet universe, I can answer the question of whether an ideal LIGO detector could detect a single graviton. The answer is no. In a quiet universe, the limit to the accuracy of measurement of distance is set by the quantum uncertainties in the positions of the mirrors. To make the quantum uncertainties small, the mirrors must be heavy. A simple calculation, based on the known laws of gravitation and quantum mechanics, leads to a striking result. To detect a single graviton with a LIGO apparatus, the mirrors must be exactly so heavy that they will attract each other with irresistible force and collapse into a black hole. In other words, Nature herself forbids us to observe a single graviton with this kind of apparatus.</p><p>I propose as a hypothesis, based on this single thought experiment, that single gravitons may be unobservable by any conceivable apparatus. If this hypothesis is true, it would imply that theories of quantum gravity are untestable and therefore scientifically meaningless. The classical universe and the quantum universe could then live together in peaceful coexistence. No incompatibility between the two pictures could ever be demonstrated. Both pictures of the universe could be true, and the hope of a unified theory could turn out to be an illusion.</p><p>IMPOSSIBLE INEXACTNESS</p><p>SATYAJIT DAS</p><p>Derivatives expert, risk-management consultant; author, Extreme Money: The Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk</p><p>Inexactness is an end often seen as the beginning. Its profound beauty transects science, mathematics, method, philosophy, linguistics, and faith.</p><p>In 1927, Werner Heisenberg showed that uncertainty is inherent in quantum mechanics. It is impossible to simultaneously measure certain properties of a particle‚Äîposition and momentum. In the quantum world, matter can take the form of either particles or waves. Fundamental elements are neither particles nor waves but can behave as either and are merely different theoretical ways of picturing the quantum world.</p><p>Inexactness marks an end to certainty. As we seek to measure one property more precisely, the ability to measure the other property is undermined. The act of measurement negates elements of our knowledge of the system.</p><p>Inexactness undermines scientific determinism, implying that human knowledge about the world is always incomplete, uncertain, and highly contingent.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_61.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_63.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
