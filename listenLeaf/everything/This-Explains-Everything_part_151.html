KANDEL</p><p>University professor and Kavli Professor of Brain Science, Columbia University; author, The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present</p><p>How did psychoanalysis, once a major mode for treating non-psychotic mental disorders, fall so badly in the estimation both of the medical community in the United States and the public at large? How can that be reversed? Let me try to address this question, putting it in some historical perspective.</p><p>While an undergraduate at Harvard College, I was drawn to psychiatry‚Äîand specifically to psychoanalysis. During my training, 1960‚Äì1965, psychotherapy was the major mode of treating mental illness, and this therapy was derived from psychoanalysis and based on the belief that one needed to understand mental symptoms in terms of their historical roots in childhood. These therapies tended to take years, and neither the outcome nor the mechanisms were studied systematically, because this was thought to be very difficult. Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, when successful, allowed people to work a bit better and to love a bit, and these were dimensions that were considered difficult to measure.</p><p>In the 1960s, Aaron Beck changed all that by introducing several major obvious but nevertheless elegant and beautiful innovations:</p><p>First, he introduced instruments for measuring mental illness. Until Beck‚Äôs work, psychiatric research was hampered by a dearth of techniques for operationalizing the various disorders and measuring their severity. Beck developed a number of instruments, beginning with a depression inventory, a hopelessness scale, and a suicide-intent scale. These scales helped objectify research in psychopathology and establish better clinical-outcome trials.</p><p>Second, Beck introduced a new short-term, evidence-based therapy he called cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p>Third, Beck manualized the treatments; he wrote a cookbook, so method could be reliably taught to others. You and I could in principle learn to do cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p>Fourth, he carried out, with the help of several colleagues, progressively better-controlled studies showing that cognitive behavioral therapy worked more effectively than placebos, and as effectively as antidepressants, in mild and moderate depression. In severe depression, it did not act as effectively as an antidepressant but acted synergistically with antidepressants to enhance recovery.</p><p>Beck‚Äôs work was picked up by Helen Mayberg, another of my heroes in psychiatry. She carried out fMRI studies of depressed patients and discovered that Brodmann area 25 was a focus of abnormal activity in depression. She went on to find that if‚Äîand only if‚Äîa patient responded to cognitive behavior therapy or to antidepressant SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), this abnormality reverted to normal.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_150.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_152.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
