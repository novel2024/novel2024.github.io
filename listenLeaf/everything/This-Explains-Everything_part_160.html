In Menger‚Äôs account, money emerges through a series of small steps, each of which is based on self-interested choices by individual traders with limited knowledge. First, individual barterers realize that when direct exchange is difficult, they can get what they want by indirect exchange. Rather than finding someone who both has what I want and wants what I have, I need only find someone who wants what I have. I can then trade what I have for his good, even though I don‚Äôt want to consume it myself, and then trade that for something I do want to consume. In that case, I will have used the intermediate good as a medium of exchange.</p><p>Menger notes that not all goods are equally marketable; some goods are easier to trade than others. It therefore pays a trader to accumulate an inventory of highly marketable items for use as media of exchange. Other alert traders in the market catch on, and eventually the market converges on a single common medium of exchange. This is money.</p><p>Menger‚Äôs theory shows not only how money can evolve without any conscious plan, but also that it doesn‚Äôt depend on legal decrees or central banks. Yet this, too, is often overlooked by mainstream economists. Take Michael Woodford, for example. Woodford is one of the most influential academic monetary economists alive today, yet in his 2003 book Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy, a central bank somehow becomes part of the economy within less than a page after the initial assumptions are introduced. Woodford does not even pause for a page to consider what a banking system would look like without a central bank. Yet free banking has a long history; the first such system began in China in about a.d. 995, more than 600 years before the first central bank.</p><p>Can we account for the emergence of central banking by the same Invisible Hand‚Äìtype of explanation Menger proposed for money? The answer depends, according to Lawrence White, on just what we mean by the term ‚Äúcentral banking.‚Äù If government sponsorship is among the defining features of a central bank, then the answer is no. The emergence of central banks cannot be accounted for entirely by market forces; at some point, deliberate state action must enter the story. The government‚Äôs motives for getting involved aren‚Äôt hard to imagine. For one thing, an exclusive supply of banknotes gives the government a source of monopoly profits in the form of a zero-interest loan from the public‚Äôs holding of these non-interest-bearing notes.</p><p>In these troubled times, when central banks are expanding the stock of high-powered money through massive quantitative easing, Menger‚Äôs theory is more relevant than ever. It alerts us to the possibility that the response to the current crisis in the euro zone need not be ever more centralization but could instead consist of a move in the opposite direction‚Äîtoward a regime in which any bank is free to issue its own banknotes, and market forces, not central banks, control the money supply.</p><p>THE PRECESSION OF THE SIMULACRA</p><p>DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF</p><p>Media analyst; documentary writer; author, Life Inc: How Corporatism Conquered the World, and How We Can Take It Back</p><p>Having discovered much too late in life that the many things I had taken for granted as preexisting conditions of the universe were, in fact, creations and ideas of people, I found French sociologist and philosopher Jean Baudrillard‚Äôs ‚Äúprecession of the simulacra‚Äù to be an immensely valuable way of understanding just how disconnected from anything to do with reality we can become.</p><p>The main idea is that there‚Äôs the real world, there‚Äôs the maps we use to describe that world, and then there‚Äôs all this other activity that occurs on the map‚Äîsometimes with little regard for the territory it‚Äôs supposed to represent. There‚Äôs the real world, there‚Äôs the representation of the world, and there‚Äôs the mistaking of this simulation for reality.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_159.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_161.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
