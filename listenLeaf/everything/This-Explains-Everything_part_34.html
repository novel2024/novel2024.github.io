Look back at all the answers to the question ‚ÄúWhat is life?‚Äù from before that, and you get a taste of just how we, as a species, floundered. Life consisted of three-dimensional objects of specificity and complexity (mainly proteins). And it copied itself with accuracy. How? How do you set about making a copy of a three-dimensional object? How do you grow it and develop it in a predictable way? This is the one scientific question whose answer absolutely nobody came close to guessing. Erwin Schr√∂dinger had a stab but fell back on quantum mechanics, which was irrelevant. True, he used the phrase ‚Äúaperiodic crystal,‚Äù and if you are generous you can see that as a prediction of a linear code, but I think that‚Äôs stretching generosity.</p><p>Indeed, the problem had just got even more baffling, thanks to the realization that DNA played a crucial role‚Äîbecause DNA was monotonously simple. All the explanations of life before February 28, 1953, are handwaving waffle and might as well have spoken of protoplasm and vital sparks for all the insight they gave.</p><p>Then came the double helix, and the immediate understanding that, as Francis Crick wrote to his son a few weeks later, ‚Äúsome sort of code‚Äù‚Äîdigital, linear, two-dimensional, combinatorially infinite, and instantly self-replicating‚Äîwas all the explanation you needed. Here‚Äôs part of Crick‚Äôs letter, March 17, 1953:</p><p>My Dear Michael,</p><p>Jim Watson and I have probably made a most important discovery. . . . Now we believe that the DNA is a code. That is, the order of the bases (the letters) makes one gene different from another gene (just as one page of print is different from another). You can see how Nature makes copies of the genes. Because if the two chains unwind into two separate chains, and if each chain makes another chain come together on it, then because A always goes with T, and G with C, we shall get two copies where we had one before. In other words, we think we have found the basic copying mechanism by which life comes from life. . . . You can understand we are excited.</p><p>Never has a mystery seemed more baffling in the morning and an explanation more obvious in the afternoon.</p><p>REDUNDANCY REDUCTION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION</p><p>RICHARD DAWKINS</p><p>Evolutionary biologist; Emeritus Professor of the Public Understanding of Science, Oxford; author, The Magic of Reality</p><p>Deep, elegant, beautiful? Part of what makes a theory elegant is its power to explain much while assuming little. Here, Darwin‚Äôs natural selection wins hands down. The ratio of the huge amount that it explains (everything about life: its complexity, diversity, and illusion of crafted design) divided by the little that it needs to postulate (nonrandom survival of randomly varying genes through geological time) is gigantic. Never in the field of human comprehension were so many facts explained by assuming so few. Elegant then, and deep‚Äîits depths hidden from everybody until as late as the 19th century. On the other hand, for some tastes, natural selection is too destructive, too wasteful, too cruel to count as beautiful. In any case, I can count on somebody else choosing Darwin. I‚Äôll take his great-grandson instead, and come back to Darwin at the end.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_33.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_35.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
