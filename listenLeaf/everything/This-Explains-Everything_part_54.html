Helmholtz would have favored the view that the major premise is learned from individual experience; others have favored evolutionary learning. In both cases, visual illusions are seen as the product of unconscious inferences based on evidence that is usually reliable but can be misleading in special circumstances.</p><p>The concept of unconscious inference can also explain phenomena from other sensory modalities. A remarkable instance where a major premise suddenly becomes incorrect is the case of a person whose leg has been amputated. Although the major premise (‚ÄúA stimulation of certain nerves is associated with that toe‚Äù) no longer holds, patients nevertheless feel pain in toes that are no longer there. The ‚Äúphantom limb‚Äù also illustrates our inability to correct unconscious inferences despite our knowledge. Helmholtz‚Äôs concept has given us a new perspective on perception in particular and cognition in general:</p><p>Cognition is inductive inference. Today, the probabilistic syllogism has been replaced by statistical and heuristic models of inference, inspired by Thomas Bayes and Herbert Simon, respectively.</p><p>Rational inferences need not be conscious. Gut feelings and intuition work with the same inductive inferences as conscious intelligence.</p><p>Illusions are a necessary consequence of intelligence. Cognition requires going beyond the information given, to make bets and therefore to risk errors. Would we be better off without visual illusions? We would in fact be worse off‚Äîlike a person who never says anything to avoid making any mistakes. A system that makes no errors is not intelligent.</p><p>SNOWFLAKES AND THE MULTIVERSE</p><p>MARTIN J.
