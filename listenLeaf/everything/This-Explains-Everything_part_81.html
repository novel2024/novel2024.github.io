Both puzzle and answer were hiding in plain sight, right under our feet. Generations of globe-twirling schoolchildren have noticed that South America‚Äôs bulge seems to fit into the gulf of Africa and that Baja California looks as if it had been cut out of the Mexican mainland. These and other more subtle clues led Alfred Wegener to propose to the German Geological Society in 1912 that the continents had once formed a single landmass. His beautiful theory was greeted with catcalls and scientific brickbats.</p><p>The problem was that Wegener‚Äôs beautiful theory lacked a mechanism. Critics sneeringly pronounced that the lightweight continents could not possibly plow through a dense and unyielding oceanic crust. No one, including Wegener, could imagine a force that could cause the continents to move. It didn‚Äôt help that Wegener was a meteorologist poaching in geophysical territory. He would die on an expedition to Greenland in 1930, his theory out of favor and all but forgotten.</p><p>Meanwhile, hints of a mechanism were everywhere but at once too small and too vast to be seen. Like ants crawling on a globe, puny humans missed the obvious. It would take the arrival of powerful new scientific tools to reveal the hidden forensics of continental drift. Sonar traced mysterious linear ridges running zipperlike along ocean floors. Magnetometers towed over the seabed painted symmetrical zebra-striped patterns of magnetic reversals. Earthquakes betrayed plate boundaries to listening seismographs. And radiometric dating laid out a scale reaching into deep time.</p><p>Three decades after Wegener‚Äôs death, the mechanism of plate tectonics emerged with breathtaking clarity. The continents weren‚Äôt plowing through anything‚Äîthey were rafting atop the crust, like marshmallows stuck in a sheet of cooling chocolate. And the oceanic crust was moving like a conveyor, with new crust created in midocean spreading centers and old crust subducted, destroyed, or crumpled upward into vast mountain ranges at the boundaries where plates met.</p><p>Elegant explanations are the Kuhnian solvent that leaches the glue from old paradigms, making space for new theories to take hold. Plate tectonics became established beyond a doubt in the mid-1960s. Contradictions suddenly made sense, and ends so loose no one thought they were remotely connected came together. Continents were seen for the wanderers they were. The Himalayas were recognized as the result of a pushy Indian plate smashing into its Eurasian neighbor, and it became obvious that an ocean was being born in Africa‚Äôs Great Rift Valley. Mysteries fell like dominoes before the predictive power of a beautiful theory and its elegant explanation. The skeptics were silenced and Wegener was posthumously vindicated.</p><p>WHY SOME SEA TURTLES MIGRATE</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_80.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_82.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
