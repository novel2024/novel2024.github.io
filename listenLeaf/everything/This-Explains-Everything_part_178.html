After all, we have more access to calories, and are more often sedentary, than in times gone by. MetSyn factors are each linked, in otherwise healthy young populations, to higher mortality.</p><p>But this view leaves many questions unanswered: Why do elements of MetSyn correlate? Why are overweight people today more likely to have diabetes than hitherto? Why are elements of MetSyn now emerging in infancy? Why is MetSyn materializing in poor and third-world nations?</p><p>The customary explanation also creates paradoxes. If MetSyn stems from energy surfeit, why do the following factors, which reduce energy supply or increase demand, promote MetSyn‚Äîfar from protecting against it?</p><p>‚Ä¢ Sleep apnea (It‚Äôs a stronger MetSyn risk factor than being overweight; moreover, sleep-apnea treatment benefits each MetSyn element)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Ultra low-calorie or low-fat diets</p><p>‚Ä¢ Fasting, skipped meals</p><p>‚Ä¢ Hypoglycemia-promoting diets (high-carbohydrate/low-fat/low-protein diets lead to unopposed insulin surge)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Deficient sleep (more energy-expending wake time)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Illness/injury/surgery (high energy demand)</p><p>‚Ä¢ Cold weather (mandating energy expenditure for thermogenesis)</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_177.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_179.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
