But with Galileo‚Äôs contribution, one can consider multiple kinds of order (improbable physical arrangements), each being defined with respect to a distinct frame of reference.</p><p>There can be as many kinds of entropy as there are meaningful frames of reference. Organisms are defined as self-replicating physical systems. This creates a frame of reference that defines its kind of order in terms of causal interrelationships that promote the replication of the system (replicative rather than thermodynamic order). Indeed, organisms must be physically designed to capture undispersed energy, and like hydroelectric dams using waterfalls to drive turbines, they use this thermodynamic entropic flow to fuel their replication, spreading multiple copies of themselves across the landscape.</p><p>Entropy sometimes introduces copying errors into replication, but injected disorder in replicative systems is self-correcting. By definition, the less well-organized are worse at replicating themselves and so are removed from the population. In contrast, copying errors that increase functional order (replicative ability) become more common. This inevitable ratchet effect in replicators is natural selection.</p><p>Organisms exploit the trick of deploying different entropic frames of reference in many diverse and subtle ways, but the underlying point is that what is naturally increasing disorder (moving toward maximally probable states) for one frame of reference inside one physical domain can be harnessed to decrease disorder with respect to another frame of reference. Natural selection picks out and links different entropic domains (e.g., cells, organs, membranes) that each impose their own proprietary entropic frames of reference locally. When the right ones are associated with each other, they do replicative work through harnessing various types of increasing entropy to decrease other kinds of entropy in ways useful for the organism. For example, oxygen diffusion from the lungs to the bloodstream to the cells is the entropy of chemical mixing‚Äîfalling toward more probable high-entropy states but increasing order from the perspective of replication promotion.</p><p>Entropy makes things fall, but life ingeniously rigs the game so that when they do, they often fall into place.</p><p>WHY THINGS HAPPEN</p><p>PETER ATKINS</p><p>Emeritus professor of chemistry, University of Oxford; author, Reactions: The Private Life of Atoms</p><p>There is a wonderful simplicity in the view that events occur because things get worse. I have in mind the second law of thermodynamics and the fact that all natural change is accompanied by an increase in entropy. Although that is in my mind, I understand those words in terms of the tendency of matter and energy to disperse in disorder. Molecules of a gas undergo ceaseless virtually random motion and spread into the available volume. The chaotic thermal motion of atoms in a block of hot metal jostles their neighbors into motion, and as the energy spreads into the surroundings, so the block cools. All natural change is at root a manifestation of this simple process‚Äîthat of dispersal in disorder.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_105.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_107.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
