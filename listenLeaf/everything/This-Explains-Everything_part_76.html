In a slim 1996 volume modestly titled Explaining Culture, he outlined a theory of culture as the residue of the epidemic spread of ideas. In this model, there is no meme, no unit of culture separate from the blooming, buzzing confusion of transactions. Instead, all cultural transmission can be reduced to one of two types: making a mental representation public, or internalizing a mental version of a public presentation. As Sperber puts it, “Culture is the precipitate of cognition and communication in a human population.”</p><p>Sperber’s two primitives—externalization of ideas, internalization of expressions—give us a way to think of culture not as a big container that people inhabit but as a network whose traces, drawn carefully, let us ask how the behaviors of individuals create larger, longer-lived patterns. Some public representations are consistently learned and then reexpressed and relearned—Mother Goose rhymes, tartan patterns, and peer review have all survived for centuries. Others move from ubiquitous to marginal in a matter of years—pet rocks, “The Piña Colada Song.” Still others thrive only within a subcultural domain—cosplay, Civil War re-enactments. (Indeed, a subculture is simply a network of people who traffic in particular representations—representations that are mostly inert in the larger culture.)</p><p>With Sperber’s network-tracing model, culture is best analyzed as an overlapping set of transactions rather than as a container or a thing or a force. Given this, we can ask detailed questions about which private ideas are made public where, and we can ask when and how often those public ideas take hold in individual minds.</p><p>Rather than arguing about whether the sonnet is still a vital part of Western culture, for example, Sperber makes it possible to ask instead, “Which people have mental representations of individual sonnets, or of the sonnet as an overall form? How often do they express those representations? How often do others remember those expressions?” Understanding sonnet-knowing becomes a network-analysis project, driven by empirical questions about how widespread, detailed, and coherent the mental representations of sonnets are. Cultural commitment to sonnets and Angry Birds and American exceptionalism and the theory of relativity can all be placed under the same lens.</p><p>This is what is so powerful about Sperber’s idea: Culture is a giant, asynchronous network of replication, ideas turning into expressions, which turn into other, related ideas. Sperber also allows us to understand why persistence of public expression can be so powerful. When I sing “Camptown Races” to my son, he internalizes his own (slightly different) version. As he learns to read sheet music, however, he gains access to a much larger universe of such representations; Beethoven is not around to hum “Für Elise” to him, but through a set of agreed-on symbols (themselves internalized as mental representations) Beethoven’s public representations can be internalized centuries later.</p><p>Sperber’s idea also suggests that increased access to public presentation of ideas will increase the dynamic range of culture overall. Some publicly available representations will take hold among the widest possible group of participants in history, in both absolute numbers and as a percentage of the human race. (Consider, for example, the number of people who can now understand the phrase “That’s killing two pigs with one bird.”) It is this globally wired possibility for global cultural imitation that evolutionary theorist Mark Pagel worries about when he talks about the Internet enabling “infinite stupidity.”</p><p>At the same time, it has never been easier for members of possible subcultures to find one another and create their own public representations at much lower cost, longer life, and greater reach than ordinary citizens have ever been able to. The January 25, 2011, protests in Egypt hijacked the official public representation of that day as National Police Day; this was possible only because the dissidents could create alternate public representations on a scale similar to the Egyptian state.</p><p>Actual reductionism—the interpretation of a large number of effects using a small number of causes—is rare in the social sciences, but Sperber has provided a framework for dissolving large and vague questions about culture into a series of tractable research programs. Most of the empirical study of the “precipitate of cognition and communication” is still in the future, but I can’t think of another current idea in the social sciences offering that degree of explanatory heft.</p><p>METAREPRESENTATIONS EXPLAIN HUMAN UNIQUENESS</p><p>HUGO MERCIER</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_75.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_77.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
