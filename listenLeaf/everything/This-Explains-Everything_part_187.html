Perhaps deep. . . . I guess we are still too young to have explanations of that sort. But there is one elegant and deep statement (which, alas, is not quite an ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù) that comes close to fulfilling the Edge Question criteria and that I find very useful as well as beautifully simple.</p><p>I refer to the well-known lines Lord Acton wrote in a letter from Naples in 1887 to the effect that ‚ÄúPower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.‚Äù At least one philosopher of science has written that on this sentence an entire science of human beings could be built.</p><p>I find that the sentence offers the basis for explaining how a failed painter like Adolf Hitler and a failed seminarian like Joseph Stalin could end up with the blood of millions on their hands; or how the Chinese emperors, the Roman popes, and the French aristocracy failed to resist the allure of power. When a religion or ideology becomes dominant, the lack of controls will result in widening spirals of license, leading to degradation and corruption.</p><p>It would be nice if Acton‚Äôs insight could be developed into a full-fledged explanation before the hegemonies of our time, based on blind faith in science and the worship of the Invisible Hand, follow older forms of power into the dustbins of history.</p><p>FACT, FICTION, AND OUR PROBABILISTIC WORLD</p><p>VICTORIA STODDEN</p><p>Computational legal scholar; assistant professor of statistics, Columbia University</p><p>How do we separate fact from fiction? We are frequently struck by seemingly unusual coincidences. Imagine seeing an inscription describing a fish in your morning reading, and then at lunch you are served fish and the conversation turns to ‚ÄúApril fish‚Äù (or April fools). That afternoon, a work associate shows you several pictures of fish, and in the evening you are presented with an embroidery of fishlike sea monsters. The next morning, a colleague tells you she dreamed of fish. This might start to seem spooky, but it turns out that we shouldn‚Äôt find it surprising. The reason has a long history, resulting in the unintuitive insight of building randomness directly into our understanding of nature, through the probability distribution.</p><p>Chance as Ignorance</p><p>Tolstoy was skeptical of our understanding of chance. He gave an example of a flock of sheep, one of which had been chosen for slaughter. This one sheep was given extra food separately from the others, and Tolstoy imagined that the flock, with no knowledge of what was coming, must find the continually fattening sheep extraordinary‚Äîsomething he thought they would assign to chance due to their limited viewpoint. Tolstoy‚Äôs solution was for the flock of sheep to stop thinking that things happen only for ‚Äúthe attainment of their sheep aims‚Äù and realize that there are hidden aims that explain everything perfectly well, and so no need to resort to the concept of chance.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_186.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_188.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
