We‚Äôve learned that we live in just one planetary system among billions, in one galaxy among billions. But now that‚Äôs not all. The entire panorama that astronomers can observe could be a tiny part of the aftermath of ‚Äúour‚Äù Big Bang, which is itself just one bang among a perhaps infinite ensemble.</p><p>Our cosmic environment could be richly textured but on scales so vast that our purview is restricted to a tiny fragment. We‚Äôre not aware of the ‚Äúbig picture,‚Äù any more than a plankton whose universe was a liter of water would be aware of the world‚Äôs topography and biosphere. It is obviously sensible for cosmologists to start off by exploring the simplest models. But there is no more reason to expect simplicity on the grandest scale than in the terrestrial environment, where intricate complexity prevails.</p><p>Moreover, string theorists suspect‚Äîfor reasons quite independent of cosmology‚Äîthat there may be an immense variety of ‚Äúvacuum states.‚Äù Were this correct, different universes could be governed by different physics. Some of what we call laws of nature may, in this grander perspective, be local bylaws, consistent with some overarching theory governing the ensemble, but not uniquely fixed by that theory. More specifically, some aspects may be arbitrary and others not. As an analogy (which I owe to the astrobiologist and cosmologist Paul Davies), consider the form of snowflakes. Their ubiquitous sixfold symmetry is a direct consequence of the properties and shape of water molecules. But snowflakes display an immense variety of patterns, because each is molded by its distinctive history and microenvironment; how each flake grows is sensitive to the fortuitous temperature and humidity changes during its growth.</p><p>If physicists achieved a fundamental theory, it would tell us which aspects of nature are direct consequences of the bedrock theory (just as the symmetrical template of snowflakes is due to the basic structure of a water molecule) and which cosmic numbers are (like the distinctive pattern of a particular snowflake) the outcome of environmental contingencies.</p><p>Our domain wouldn‚Äôt then be just a random one. It would belong to the unusual subset where there was a ‚Äúlucky draw‚Äù of cosmic numbers conducive to the emergence of complexity and consciousness. Its seemingly designed or fine-tuned features wouldn‚Äôt be surprising. We may, by the end of this century, be able to say with confidence whether we live in a multiverse and how much variety its constituent universes display. The answer to this question will, I think, determine crucially how we should interpret the ‚Äúbiofriendly‚Äù universe in which we live (and which we share with any aliens whom we might one day contact).</p><p>It may disappoint some physicists if some of the key numbers they‚Äôre trying to explain turn out to be mere environmental contingencies, no more ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù than the parameters of Earth‚Äôs orbit around the sun. But that disappointment would surely be outweighed by the revelation that physical reality was grander and richer than hitherto envisioned.</p><p>EINSTEIN‚ÄôS PHOTONS</p><p>ANTON ZEILINGER</p><p>Physicist, University of Vienna; scientific director, Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Austrian Academy of Sciences; author, Dance of the Photons: From Einstein to Quantum Teleportation</p><p>My favorite deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation is Albert Einstein‚Äôs 1905 proposal that light consists of energy quanta, today called photons. It is little known, even among physicists, but extremely interesting how Einstein came to this conclusion. It‚Äôs often thought that he invented the concept to explain the photoelectric effect. Certainly that is part of Einstein‚Äôs 1905 publication, but only toward its end. The idea itself is much deeper, more elegant‚Äîand, yes, more beautiful.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_54.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_56.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
