Under normal circumstances, memories of daily events are consolidated by an area of the brain called the hippocampus. But in frightening situations‚Äîsuch as a car accident or a robbery‚Äîanother area, the amygdala, also lays down memories along an independent, secondary memory track. Amygdala memories have a different quality to them: They are difficult to erase and they can return in ‚Äúflash-bulb‚Äù fashion‚Äîa common description of rape victims and war veterans. In other words, there is more than one way to lay down memory. We‚Äôre talking not about memories of different events but about different memories of the same event. According to the unfolding picture, there may be even more than two factions involved, all writing down information and later competing to tell the story. The unity of memory is an illusion.</p><p>Consider the different systems involved in decision making: Some are fast, automatic, and below the surface of conscious awareness; others are slow, cognitive, and conscious. And there‚Äôs no reason to assume that there are only two systems; there may well be a spectrum. Some networks in the brain are implicated in long-term decisions, others in short-term impulses‚Äîand there may be a fleet of medium-term biases as well.</p><p>Attention, also, has recently come to be understood as the end result of multiple, competing networks, some for focused, dedicated attention to a specific task and others for monitoring broadly (vigilance). They are always locked in competition to steer the actions of the organism. Even basic sensory functions like the detection of motion appear now to have been reinvented multiple times by evolution. This provides the perfect substrate for a neural democracy.</p><p>On a larger anatomical scale, the two hemispheres of the brain, left and right, can be understood as overlapping systems that compete. We know this from patients whose hemispheres are disconnected: They essentially function with two independent brains. For example, put a pencil in each hand and they can simultaneously draw incompatible figures, such as a circle and a triangle. The two hemispheres function differently in the domains of language, abstract thinking, story construction, inference, memory, gambling strategies, and so on. They constitute a team of rivals: agents with the same goals but slightly different ways of going about them.</p><p>To my mind, this elegant solution to the mysteries of the brain should change the goal for aspiring neuroscientists. Instead of spending years advocating for your favorite solution, the mission should evolve into elucidating the various overlapping solutions: how they compete, how the union is held together, and what happens when things fall apart.</p><p>Part of the importance of discovering elegant solutions is capitalizing on them. The neural-democracy model may be just the thing to dislodge artificial intelligence. We human programmers still approach a problem by assuming there‚Äôs a best way to solve it or there‚Äôs a way it should be solved. But evolution does not solve a problem and then check it off the list. Instead, it ceaselessly reinvents programs, each with overlapping and competing approaches. The lesson is to abandon the question ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the cleverest way to solve this problem?‚Äù in favor of ‚ÄúAre there multiple, overlapping ways to solve this problem?‚Äù That will be the starting point in ushering in a fruitful new age of elegantly inelegant computational devices.</p><p>OUR BOUNDED RATIONALITY</p><p>MAHZARIN BANAJI</p><p>Richard Clarke Cabot Professor of Social Ethics, Department of Psychology, Harvard University</p><p>Explanations that are extraordinary both analytically and aesthetically share, among others, these properties: (a) They are often simpler compared with what was received wisdom, (b) they point to the truer cause as being something quite removed from the phenomenon, and (c) they make you wish you‚Äôd come upon the explanation yourself.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_67.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_69.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
