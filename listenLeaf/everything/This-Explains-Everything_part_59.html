Hierarchical does not mean isotropic, and observed anisotropy does not rule it out.</p><p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716), a lawyer as well as a scientist, believed that our universe was selected, out of an infinity of possible universes, to produce maximum diversity from a minimal set of natural laws. It‚Äôs hard to imagine a more beautiful set of boundary conditions than zero density and infinite mass. But this same principle of maximum diversity warns us that it may take all the time in the universe to work the details out.</p><p>OUR UNIVERSE GREW LIKE A BABY</p><p>MAX TEGMARK</p><p>Cosmologist; associate professor of physics, MIT; scientific director, Foundational Questions Institute</p><p>What caused our Big Bang? My favorite deep explanation is that our baby universe grew like a baby human‚Äîliterally. Right after your conception, each of your cells doubled roughly daily, causing your total number of cells to increase day by day as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Repeated doubling is a powerful process, so your mom would have been in trouble if you‚Äôd kept doubling your weight every day until you were born: After nine months (about 274 doublings), you would have weighed more than all the matter in our observable universe combined.</p><p>Crazy as it sounds, this is exactly what our baby universe did, according to the inflation theory pioneered by Alan Guth and others. Starting out with a speck much smaller and lighter than an atom, it repeatedly doubled its size until it was more massive than our entire observable universe, expanding at dizzying speed. And it doubled not daily but almost instantly. In other words, inflation created our mighty Big Bang out of almost nothing, in a tiny fraction of a second. By the time you reached about 10 centimeters in size, your expansion had transitioned from accelerating to decelerating. In the simplest inflation models, our baby universe did the same when it was about 10 centimeters in size, its exponential growth spurt slowing to a more leisurely expansion wherein hot plasma diluted and cooled and its constituent particles gradually coalesced into nuclei, atoms, molecules, stars, and galaxies.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_58.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_60.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
