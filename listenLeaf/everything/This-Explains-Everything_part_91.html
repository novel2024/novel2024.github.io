First, the depth, elegance, and beauty of our intuitive metaphysical explanations can be a liability. These explanations are so broad and so simple that we let them operate in the background, constantly invoked but rarely scrutinized. As a result, most of us can’t defend them and don’t revise them. Metaphysical half-truths find a safe and happy home in most human minds.</p><p>Second, the depth, elegance, and beauty of our intuitive metaphysical explanations can make us appreciate them less rather than more. Like a constant hum, we forget that they are there. It follows that the explanations most often celebrated for their virtues—explanations such as natural selection and relativity—are importantly different from those that form the bedrock of intuitive beliefs. Celebrated explanations have the characteristics of the solution to a good murder mystery. Where intuitive metaphysical explanations are easy to generate but hard to evaluate, scientific superstars like evolution are typically the reverse: hard to generate but easy to evaluate. We need philosophers like Hume to nudge us from complacency in the first case and scientists like Darwin to advance science in the second.</p><p>ALL WE NEED IS HELP</p><p>SEIRIAN SUMNER</p><p>Research fellow in the evolution of sociality, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London</p><p>I play this game with my kids. It’s a “Guess who?” game: Think of an animal, person, or object, and then try to describe it to another person without giving away the identity. The other person has to guess what/who you are. You have to get in character and tell a story: What do you do, how do you feel, what do you think and want?</p><p>Let’s have a go. Read the character scenarios below and see if you can guess who/what they are.</p><p>“It’s just not fair! Mum says I’m getting in the way, I’m a layabout, and she can’t afford for me to stay with her anymore. But I like being in a big family, and I don’t want to leave. Why take the risk of leaving home? Who knows what lies out there! Mum says that if I am to stay home, we’d need some kind of ‘glue’ to keep us from drifting apart. Now, glue is costly, and she says she hasn’t the time or energy to make it, since she’s busy making babies. But then I had this brilliant idea: How about I make the glue, using a bit of cell wall (Mum won’t mind), add some glycoproteins (they’re a bit sticky, so I have to promise Mum I’ll wash my hands afterward), and bingo! Job done: We’ve got ourselves a nice cosy extracellular matrix! I’m happy doing the bulk of the work, so long as Mum keeps giving me more siblings. I suggested this to Mum last night, and guess what? She said yes! But she also said I’m out the door if I don’t keep up my side of the bargain. No free-riders. . . .”</p><p>Who am I? I am a unicell becoming multicellular. If I group with my relatives, then someone needs to pay the cost of keeping us together—the extracellular matrix. I don’t mind paying that cost if I benefit from the replication of my own genes through my relatives.</p><p>OK, that’s a tough one.
