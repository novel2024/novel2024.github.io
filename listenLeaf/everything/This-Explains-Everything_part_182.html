At birth you receive a loan‚Äîconsciousness and light borrowed from the void, leaving a hole in the emptiness. The hole will grow bigger each day. Nightly, by yielding temporarily to the darkness of sleep, you restore some of the emptiness and keep the hole from growing limitlessly. In the end, you must pay back the principal, complete the void, and return the life originally lent you.</p><p>By focusing on the common periodic nature of sleep and interest payments, Schopenhauer extends the metaphor of borrowing to life itself. Life and consciousness are the principal, death is the final repayment, and sleep is la petite mort, the periodic little death that renews.</p><p>DENUMERABLE INFINITIES AND MENTAL STATES</p><p>DAVID GELERNTER</p><p>Computer scientist, Yale University; chief scientist, Mirror Worlds Technologies; author, America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered In the Obamacrats)</p><p>My favorites:</p><p>The 19th-century German mathematician Georg Cantor‚Äôs explanation of why all denumerable infinities are the same size‚Äîwhy, for example, the set of all integers is the same size as the set of all positive integers, or all even integers‚Äîand why some infinities are bigger than others. (The set of all rational numbers is the same size as the set of all integers, but the set of all real numbers‚Äîterminating plus nonterminating decimals‚Äîis larger.) The set of all positive integers is the same size as the set of all even, positive integers‚Äîto see that, just line them up, one by one. 1 is paired with 2 (the first even positive integer), 2 is paired with 4, 3 with 6, 4 with 8, and so on. You‚Äôd think there would be more positive integers than even ones; but this pairing-off shows that no positive integer will ever be left without a partner. (And so they all dance happily off and there are no wallflowers.) The other proofs are similar in their stunning simplicity, but much easier to demonstrate on a blackboard than describe in words.</p><p>Equally favorite: Philosopher John Searle‚Äôs proof that no digital computer can have mental states (a mental state is, for example, your state of mind when I say, ‚ÄúPicture a red rose‚Äù and you do)‚Äîthat minds can‚Äôt be built out of software. A digital computer can do only trivial arithmetic and logical instructions. You can do them, too; you can execute any instruction that a computer can execute. You can also imagine yourself executing lots and lots of trivial instructions. Then ask yourself, ‚ÄúCan I picture a new mind emerging on the basis of my doing lots and lots and lots of trivial instructions?‚Äù No. Or imagine yourself sorting a deck of cards‚Äîsorting is the kind of thing digital computers do. Now imagine sorting a bigger and bigger and bigger deck. Can you see consciousness emerging at some point, when you sort a large enough batch? Nope.</p><p>And the inevitable answer to the inevitable first objection: But neurons only do simple signal transmission‚Äîcan you imagine consciousness emerging out of that? This is an irrelevant question. The fact that lots of neurons make a mind has no bearing on the question of whether lots of anything else make a mind. I can‚Äôt imagine being a neuron, but I can imagine executing machine instructions. No mind emerges, no matter how many of those instructions I carry out.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_181.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_183.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
