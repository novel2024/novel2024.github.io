They have (classical) physics envy‚Äîfor smooth, linear physics and describably delicious four-letter words, like F=ma. But modern science has moved on, embracing the complex. Occam now uses a Web-enabled fractal e-razor. Even in mathematics, stripped of the awkward realities of nonideal gases, turbulence, and nonspherical cows, simple statements about integers like Fermat‚Äôs an + bn = cn and wrangling maps with four colors take many years and pages (occasionally computers) to prove.</p><p>The question is not ‚ÄúWhat is your favorite elegant explanation?‚Äù but ‚ÄúWhat should your favorite elegant explanation be?‚Äù We‚Äôre capable of changing not only our minds but also the whole fabric of human nature. As we engineer, we recurse‚Äîsuccessively approximating ourselves as an increasingly survivable force of nature. If so, what will we ultimately admire? Our evolutionary baggage served our ancestors well but could kill our descendants. Faced with modern foods, our frugal metabolisms feed a diabetes epidemic. Our love of ‚Äúgreedy algorithms‚Äù leads to exhausted resources. Our too-easy switching from rationality to blind faith or fear-based decision making can be manipulated politically to drive conspicuous consumption. (Think Easter Island, 163 square kilometers of devastation, scaled to Earth Island at 510 million square kilometers.) ‚ÄúHumans‚Äù someday may be born with bug-fixes for dozens of current cognitive biases, as well as intuitive understanding and motivation to manipulate quantum weirdnesses, dimensions beyond three, super rare events, global economics, etc. Agricultural and cultural monocultures are evolutionarily bankrupt. Evolution was only briefly focused on surviving in a sterile world of harsh physics, but ever since has focused on life competing with itself. Elegant explanations are those that predict the future farther and better. Our explanations will help us dodge asteroids, solar red-giant flares, and even close encounters with the Andromeda galaxy. But most of all, we will diversify to deal with our own ever-increasing complexity.</p><p>TINBERGEN‚ÄôS QUESTIONS</p><p>IRENE PEPPERBERG</p><p>Research associate & lecturer, Harvard University; adjunct associate professor of psychology, Brandeis University; author, Alex & Me</p><p>Why do we‚Äîand all other creatures‚Äîbehave as we do? No answers really exist. I chose the ethologist and ornithologist Nikolaas Tinbergen‚Äôs questions for exactly that reason, because sometimes there is no one deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation. Much like a teacher of fishing rather than a giver of fish, Tinbergen did not try to provide a global explanation but instead gave us a scaffolding upon which to build our own answers to each individual behavioral pattern we observe‚Äîa scaffolding that can be used not only for the ethological paradigms for which he was famous but also for all forms of behavior in any domain. Succinctly, Tinbergen asked:</p><p>‚Ä¢ What is the mechanism? How does it seem to work?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_188.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_190.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
