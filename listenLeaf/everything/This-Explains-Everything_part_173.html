At last, the Copernican theory, formulated long ago, had more credibility. From this vast step forward, new science and new culture could be born.</p><p>HORMESIS IS REDUNDANCY</p><p>NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB</p><p>Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering, NYU-Poly; author, The Black Swan</p><p>Nature is the master statistician and probabilist. It follows a certain logic based on layers of redundancies, as a central risk-management approach. Nature builds with extra spare parts (two kidneys) and extra capacity in many, many things (say lungs, neural system, arterial apparatus, etc.), while designs by humans tend to be spare and overoptimized, and have the opposite attribute of redundancy‚Äîthat is, leverage; we have a historical track record of engaging in debt, which is the reverse of redundancy ($50,000 in extra cash in the bank or, better, under the mattress, is redundancy; owing the bank an equivalent amount is debt).</p><p>Now, remarkably, the mechanism called hormesis is a form of redundancy and statistically sophisticated in ways human science (so far) has failed us.</p><p>Hormesis is when a bit of a harmful substance, or stressor, in the right dose or with the right intensity, stimulates the organism and makes it better, stronger, healthier, and prepared for a stronger dose the next exposure. That‚Äôs the reason we go to the gym, engage in intermittent fasting or caloric deprivation, or overcompensate for challenges by getting tougher. Hormesis lost some scientific respect, interest, and practice after the 1930s, partly because some people mistakenly associated it with the practice of homeopathy. The association was unfairly done, as the mechanisms are extremely different. Homeopathy relies on other principles, such as the one that minute, highly diluted parts of the agents of a disease (so small they can hardly be perceptible, hence cannot cause hormesis) could help medicate against the disease itself. It has shown little empirical backing and belongs today to alternative medicine, while hormesis, as an effect, has shown ample scientific evidence.</p><p>Now it turns out that the logics of redundancy and overcompensation are the same‚Äîas if nature had a simple, elegant, and uniform style in doing things. If I ingest, say, 15 milligrams of a poisonous substance, my body will get stronger, preparing for 20, or more. Stressing my bones (karate practice or carrying water on my head) will cause them to prepare for greater stress by getting denser and tougher. A system that overcompensates is necessarily in overshooting mode, building extra capacity and strength in anticipation for the possibility of a worse outcome, in response to information about the possibility of a hazard. This is a very sophisticated form of discovering probabilities via stressors. And of course such extra capacity or strength becomes useful‚Äîin itself‚Äîas opportunistic as it can be used to some benefit even in the absence of the hazard. Redundancy is an aggressive, not a defensive, approach to life.</p><p>Alas, our institutional risk-management methods are vastly different. Current practice is to look in the past for the worst-case scenario, called a ‚Äústress test,‚Äù and adjust accordingly, never imagining that, just as the past experienced a large deviation that did not have a predecessor, such deviation might be insufficient. For instance, current systems take the worst historical recession, the worst war, the worst historical move in interest rates, the worst point in unemployment, etc., as an anchor for the worst future outcome. Many of us have been frustrated‚Äîvery frustrated‚Äîby the method of stress testing in which people never go beyond what has happened before, and have even had to face the usual expression of naive empiricism (‚ÄúDo you have evidence?‚Äù) when suggesting that we need to consider worse.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_172.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_174.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
