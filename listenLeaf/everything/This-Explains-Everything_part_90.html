It can take years of philosophical training to recognize their presence and evaluate their merits. Consider the following three examples:</p><p>Realism.</p><p>We explain the success of our scientific theories by an appeal to what philosophers call realism‚Äîthe idea that they are more or less true. In other words, chemistry ‚Äúworks‚Äù because atoms actually exist, and hand-washing prevents disease because there really are loitering pathogens.</p><p>Other minds.</p><p>We explain why people act the way they do by positing that they have minds more or less like our own. We assume they have feelings, beliefs, and desires, and that they are not (for instance) zombie automata that convincingly act as if they have minds. This requires an intuitive leap.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>We explain the predictable relationship between some events we call causes and others we call effects by an appeal to a mysterious power called causation. Yet, as noted by 18th-century philosopher David Hume, we never ‚Äúdiscover anything but one event following another,‚Äù and we never directly observe ‚Äúa force or power by which the cause operates, or any connection between it and its supposed effect.‚Äù*</p><p>These explanations are at the core of humans‚Äô understanding of the world‚Äîof our intuitive metaphysics. They also illustrate the hallmarks of a satisfying explanation: They unify many disparate phenomena by appealing to a small number of core principles. In other words, they are broad but simple. Realism can explain the success of chemistry, but also of physics, zoology, and deep-sea ecology. A belief in other minds can help someone understand politics, their family, and Middlemarch. And assuming a world governed by orderly, causal relationships helps explain the predictable associations between the moon and the tides as well as that between caffeine consumption and sleeplessness.</p><p>Nonetheless, each explanation has been seriously attacked at one point or another. Take realism, for example. While many of our current scientific theories are admittedly impressive, they come at the end of a long succession of failures: Every past theory has been wrong. Ptolemy‚Äôs astronomy had a good run, but then came the Copernican revolution. Newtonian mechanics is truly impressive, but it was ultimately superseded by contemporary physics. Modesty and common sense suggest that, like their predecessors, our current theories will eventually be overturned. But if they aren‚Äôt true, why are they so effective? Intuitive realism is at best a metaphysical half-truth, albeit a fairly harmless one.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_89.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_91.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
