But human frames of reference go beyond mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Do we know how to transform between human frames of reference successfully? Are they more often than not ‚ÄúLagrangian‚Äù and relative? Perhaps we could take a cue from science and find an elegant solution. Or at least an elegant explanation.</p><p>EPIGENETICS‚ÄîTHE MISSING LINK</p><p>HELEN FISHER</p><p>Biological anthropologist, Rutgers University; author, Why Him? Why Her? How to Find and Keep Lasting Love</p><p>To me, epigenetics is the most monumental explanation to emerge in the social and biological sciences since Darwin proposed his theories of natural selection and sexual selection. More than 2,500 articles, many scientific meetings, the San Diego Epigenome Center and other institutes, a five-year Epigenomics Program launched in 2008 by the National Institutes of Health, and many other institutions, academic forums, and people are devoted to this new field. Although epigenetics has been defined in several ways, all are based on the concept that environmental forces can affect gene behavior, either turning genes on or off. As an anthropologist untrained in advanced genetics, I won‚Äôt attempt to explain the processes involved, although two basic mechanisms are known: One involves molecules known as methyl groups that latch on to DNA to suppress and silence gene expression; the other involves molecules known as acetyl groups, which activate and enhance gene expression.</p><p>The consequences of epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be significant. Scientists hypothesize that epigenetic factors play a role in the etiology of many diseases, conditions, and human variations, from cancers to clinical depression and mental illnesses to human behavioral and cultural variations.</p><p>Take the Moroccan Amazighs, or Berbers, people with highly similar genetic profiles who now reside in three different environments: Some roam the deserts as nomads, some farm the mountain slopes, some live in the towns and cities along the Moroccan coast. And depending on where they live, up to one-third of their genes are differentially expressed, reports researcher Youssef Idaghdour.*</p><p>For example, among the urbanites, some genes in the respiratory system are switched on‚Äîperhaps, Idaghdour suggests, to counteract their new vulnerability to asthma and bronchitis in these smoggy surroundings. Idaghdour and his colleagues propose that epigenetic mechanisms have altered the expression of many genes in these three Berber populations, producing their population differences.</p><p>Psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists have long been preoccupied with our childhood experiences‚Äîspecifically, how these sculpt our adult attitudes and behaviors. Yet they have focused on how the brain integrates and remembers these occurrences. Epigenetic studies provide a different explanation. For example, mother rats that spend more time licking and grooming their young during the first week after birth produce infants who later become better-adjusted adults. And researcher Moshe Szyf proposes that this behavioral adjustment occurs because epigenetic mechanisms are triggered during this critical period, producing a more active version of a gene that encodes a specific protein. Then this protein, via complex pathways, sets up a feedback loop in the hippocampus of the brain‚Äîenabling these rats to cope more efficiently with stress.*</p><p>These behavioral modifications remain stable through adulthood. However, Szyf notes that when specific chemicals were injected into the adult rats‚Äô brains to alter these epigenetic processes and suppress this gene expression, these well-adjusted rats became anxious and frightened. And when different chemicals were injected to trigger epigenetic processes that instead enhance the expression of this gene, fearful adult rats (rats that had received little maternal care in infancy) became more relaxed.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_101.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_103.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
