So far, it has been tested in circumstances where the energy of motion of a particle is as much as 11 orders of magnitude greater than its mass. This is pretty impressive, but there‚Äôs still a lot of room for the principle of inertia to fail. Only experiment can tell us whether it or its failure will be the core of revolutions in science to come.</p><p>But whatever the outcome, it is the only explanation in science to have survived unscathed for so long, to have proved valid over such a range of scales, and to have sparked so many scientific revolutions.</p><p>SEEING IS BELIEVING: FROM PLACEBOS TO MOVIES IN OUR BRAIN</p><p>ERIC J. TOPOL</p><p>Gary and Mary West Chair of Innovative Medicine and professor of translational genomics, Scripps Research Institute; author, The Creative Destruction of Medicine</p><p>Our brain‚Äîwith its 100 billion neurons and quadrillion synapses give or take a few billion here or there‚Äîis one of the most complex entities to demystify. And that may be a good thing, since we don‚Äôt necessarily want others reading our minds, which would take the recent megatrend of transparency much too far.</p><p>But the use of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to image the brain and construct sophisticated activation maps validates the ‚ÄúSeeing is believing‚Äù aphorism for any skeptics. One of the longest controversies in medicine has been whether the placebo effect, a notoriously complex mind-body endproduct, has a genuine biological mechanism. That controversy now seems to be resolved with the recognition that the opioid-drug pathway‚Äîinduced by drugs like morphine and oxycontin‚Äîshares the same brain-activation pattern as that of the administration of placebos for pain relief. And dopamine release from specific regions of the brain has been detected after administering a placebo to patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Indeed, the upgrading of the placebo effect to include discrete, distinguishable psychobiological mechanisms has now prompted consideration of placebo medications as therapeutics‚ÄîHarvard University recently set up a dedicated institute called the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_170.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_172.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
