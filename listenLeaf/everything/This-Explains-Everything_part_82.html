DENNETT</p><p>Philosopher; university professor and codirector, Center for Cognitive Studies, Tufts University; author, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</p><p>My choice is an explanation that delights me. It may be true and may be false‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know, but probably somebody who reads Edge will be able to say, authoritatively, with suitable references. I am eager to find out. I was told some years ago that the reason that some species of sea turtles migrate all the way across the South Atlantic to lay their eggs on the east coast of South America after mating on the west coast of Africa is that when the behavior started, Gondwana was just beginning to break apart (that would be between 130 and 110 million years ago), and these turtles were just swimming across the narrow strait to lay their eggs. Each year the swim was a little longer‚Äîmaybe an inch or so‚Äîbut who could notice that? Eventually they were crossing the ocean to lay their eggs, having no idea, of course, why they would do such an extravagant thing.</p><p>What is delicious about this example is that it vividly illustrates several important evolutionary themes: the staggering power over millions of years of change so gradual it is essentially unnoticeable; the cluelessness of much animal behavior, even when it is adaptive; and of course the eye-opening perspective that evolution by natural selection can offer to the imagination of the curious naturalist. It also demonstrates either the way an evolutionary hypothesis can be roundly refuted by discoverable facts (if it is refuted) or the way it can be supported by further evidence (if in fact it is so supported).</p><p>An attractive hypothesis such as this is the beginning, not the end, of the inquiry. Critics often deride evolutionary hypotheses about prehistoric events as ‚Äújust-so stories,‚Äù but as a blanket condemnation this charge should be rejected out of hand. Thousands of such hypotheses‚Äîfirst dreamed up on slender evidence‚Äîhave been tested and confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt. Thousands of others have been tested and disconfirmed. They were just-so stories until they weren‚Äôt, in other words. That‚Äôs the way science advances.</p><p>I have noticed that there is a pattern in the use of the ‚Äújust-so story‚Äù charge: With almost no exceptions, it is applied to hypotheses about human evolution. Nobody seems to object that we can‚Äôt know enough about the selective environment leading to whales or flowers for us to hold forth so confidently about how and why whales and flowers evolved as they did. So my rule of thumb is: If you see the ‚Äújust-so story‚Äù epithet hurled, look for a political motive. You‚Äôll almost always find one. While it is no doubt true that some evolutionary psychologists have offered hypotheses about human evolution for which there is still only slender supporting evidence, and while it is also no doubt true that some evolutionary psychologists have been less than diligent in seeking further evidence to confirm or disconfirm their favorite hypotheses, this is at most a criticism of the thoroughness of some researchers in the field, not a condemnation of their method or their hypotheses. The same could be said about many other topics in evolutionary biology.</p><p>A HOT YOUNG EARTH: UNQUESTIONABLY BEAUTIFUL AND STUNNINGLY WRONG</p><p>CARL ZIMMER</p><p>Science writer; author, A Planet of Viruses</p><p>Around 4.567 billion years ago, a giant cloud of dust collapsed in on itself. At the center of the cloud, our sun began to burn, while the outlying dust grains began to stick together as they orbited the new star. Within a million years, those clumps of dust had become protoplanets. Within about 50 million years, our own planet had already reached about half its current size. As more protoplanets crashed into Earth, it continued to grow. All told, it may have taken another 50 million years to reach its full size, a time during which a Mars-sized planet crashed into it, leaving behind a token of its visit‚Äîour moon.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_81.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_83.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
