It is the ultimate authority and arbiter of our perceptual reality. That consciousness is still an intractable problem for scientists and philosophers to understand is not surprising. Whatever the final answer turns out to be, I suspect it will be an illusion the mind evolved to hide the messy workings of its parallel modular computing.</p><p>Neurophysiologists are finding, as they pull ever so slightly at the veil that shrouds the ‚ÄúWizard of I,‚Äù that this indispensable attentive and observant self-monitor called consciousness is dependent on a trick in overseeing our perceptions. Our subjective sense of time does not correspond to reality. Cortical-evoked potentials‚Äîelectrical recordings‚Äîof the normal brain during routine activity have been shown to precede by almost a third of a second the awareness of an actual willed movement or a response to sensory stimulation. The cortical-evoked potentials indicate that the brain is initiating or reacting to what is happening far sooner than the instantaneous perception we experience. On a physiological scale, this represents a huge discrepancy that our mind corrects by falsifying the actual time an action or event occurs, thus enabling our conscious experience to conform to what we perceive.</p><p>But data even more damaging to our confidence in the reliability of our perceptions come from studies of rapid eye movements, called saccades, that are triggered by novel visual stimuli. During the brief moments of these jerky eye movements, visual input to the brain is actively suppressed; we are literally blind. Without this involuntary ocular censorship, we would be repeatedly plagued with moments of acute blurred vision that would be unpleasant as well as unsafe. From a survival calculus, this would pose an extreme disadvantage, since it would invariably occur with novel stimuli, which by their very nature require not the worst but the best visual acuity.</p><p>The Wizard‚Äôs solution to this intolerable situation is to exclude those intervals from our stream of awareness and replace them instead with a vision extrapolated from what just occurred to what is immediately anticipated. Consciousness, like a former president, has to come up with an accounting for the erased period. Evolution provided a much longer epic to work out the bugs in this necessary deception than the limited time frame under the gun of a special prosecutor. Instead of trying to hide the existence of the tape, consciousness came up with a far cleverer trick of obscuring the deletion. It does this by falsifying the time, backdating those necessary moments so that there is no appearance of any gap.</p><p>This illusion of visual continuity from inference and extrapolation reveals an innate vulnerability in the brain‚Äôs software that any good hacker can exploit. Magicians, card sharks, three-card-monte hustlers have made a nice living working this perceptual flaw. In a comic routine, Richard Pryor expressed this best when caught by his wife with another woman. ‚ÄúWho are you going to believe?
