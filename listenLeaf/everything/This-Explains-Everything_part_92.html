I like having babies, and I‚Äôve probably already had too many this year‚Äîat least that‚Äôs what my children tell me. But I seem to be pretty good at it. I love them all equally, obviously. Damn hard work, though, especially since their father didn‚Äôt stick around. Interested in only one thing, he was, and off in a flash. But I can‚Äôt see my latest babies surviving unless I get some help around the place‚Äîall these mouths to feed, no time to clear up the place. So I said to my oldest the other day, ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs about it, kid? Fancy helping your old ma out around the place a bit? Here‚Äôs the deal: You go find some food while I just squeeze out a few more siblings for you. Remember, kid, I‚Äôm doing this for you‚Äîall these siblings I‚Äôm making, it‚Äôll pay off in the long run. One day, one of them will be a ma just like me‚Äîimagine that! And you‚Äôll still be reaping the benefits from her, too, long after you and I are gone. This way you don‚Äôt ever have to worry about sex, men, or any of that sperm stuff. Your old ma‚Äôs got everything you need, right here. All you have to do is feed us and clear out the mess. There‚Äôs a good kid‚Äîoff you go, but don‚Äôt talk to strangers, especially men!‚Äô ‚Äù</p><p>Who am I? I am an insect becoming a society. If I nest alone, I have to find food, which means leaving my young unprotected. If some of my grown-up children stay home and help me, they can go out foraging, leaving me to defend the young. I can have even more babies this way, which my children love, as this means more and more of their genes are passed on through their siblings. Anyway, it‚Äôs a pretty tough world out there right now for youngsters. It‚Äôs much less risky to stay at home.</p><p>A little tweaking of the details in the above sketches and I could equally be a gene becoming a genome, or a prokaryote becoming a eukaryote. I am part of the same fundamental event in evolution‚Äôs playground. I am the evolution of helping and cooperation. I am the major transition that shapes all levels of biological complexity. The reason I happen is because I help others like me, and we agree on a division of labor (OK, there are some fights, but we balance conflict with cooperation, and sometimes a little coercion doesn‚Äôt go amiss). And the reason I help is not because it makes me feel good but because, paradoxically, I benefit from helping. My secret? I‚Äôm pretty selective: I like to help my relatives, because they end up also helping me, by passing on our shared genes. I‚Äôve embraced the transition from autonomy to cooperation, and it feels good!</p><p>The evolution of cooperation and helping behavior is a beautiful and simple explanation for how nature got complex, diverse, and wonderful. It‚Äôs not restricted to the charismatic meerkats or the fluffy bumblebees. It‚Äôs a general phenomenon that sweeps across the good, bad, and ugly sides of nature, generating the biological hierarchies that characterize the natural world. Groups of individuals (genes, prokaryotes, single-celled and multicellular organisms) that could previously replicate independently come together to form new, more complex individuals in their own right. This new collective individual can replicate only as a whole. Take each component in isolation and it is unable to function or pass genes on to the next generation.</p><p>The simplest, most elegant rule in the natural world explains why this complexity evolves: William Hamilton‚Äôs 1964 inclusive-fitness theory, which encompasses the essence of natural selection. Entities cooperate because it increases their fitness‚Äîtheir chance of passing on genes to the next generation. Receivers of help benefit from enhanced personal reproduction‚Äîdirect fitness. Helpers benefit from the propagation of the genes they share with the relatives they help‚Äîindirect fitness. We still have solitary insects, single-celled organisms, and prokaryotes, because the conditions need to be right for division of labor to evolve: The benefits must outweigh the costs, and this sum is affected by the options available to independent replicating entities. Ecology and environment play a role, as well as kinship. The resulting division of labor is the fundamental basis of societal living, uniting genes into genomes, uniting mitochondria and prokaryotes to produce eukaryotes, uniting unicellular organisms into multicellular ones and solitary animals into eusocieties. Without the evolution of helping and division of labor, there would be no eukaryotes, no multicellular organisms, no animal societies‚Äîin short, our planet would be barren and dull.</p><p>We have understood this simple concept for almost half a century now. It‚Äôs only very recently, however, that we have realized that the evolution of helping explains not just the transition to eusociality in insects (for which Hamilton originally developed the theory) but also the evolution of major transitions to biological complexity in general. Among others, Andrew Bourke produced an insightful synthesis of this unified framework for the origins of biological complexity in his recent book Principles of Social Evolution. This satisfyingly simple explanation makes the complexities of the world less mysterious but no less wonderful.</p><p>If only adults played children‚Äôs games more often, perhaps we‚Äôd stumble across other simple explanations for the complexities of life.</p><p>IN THE BEGINNING IS THE THEORY</p><p>HELENA CRONIN</p><p>Codirector of the London School of Economics‚Äô Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science; author, The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_91.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_93.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
