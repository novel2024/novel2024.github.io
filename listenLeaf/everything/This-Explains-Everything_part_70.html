In the visual cortex, for example, neurons in the initial layer each receive inputs from a single photoreceptor in the retina. Thus, when one photoreceptor is stimulated, so is ‚Äúits‚Äù neuron in the primary visual cortex. Stimulate the adjacent photoreceptor, and the adjacent neuron activates. Basically, each of these neurons ‚Äúknows‚Äù one thing‚Äînamely, how to recognize a particular dot of light. Groups of I-know-a-dot neurons then project onto single neurons in the second cortical layer. Stimulate a particular array of adjacent neurons in that first cortical layer, and a single second-layer neuron activates. Thus, a second-layer neuron knows one thing, which is how to recognize, say, a 45-degree-angle line of light. Then groups of I-know-a-line neurons send projections on to the next layer.</p><p>Beautiful, explains everything‚Äîjust keep going, cortical layer upon layer of feature extraction, dot to line to curve to collection of curves, until the top layer, where a neuron would know one complex, specialized thing only, like how to recognize your grandmother. And it would be the same in the auditory cortex: first-layer neurons knowing particular single notes, second layer knowing pairs of notes, some neuron at the top that would recognize the sound of your grandmother singing along with Lawrence Welk.</p><p>It turns out, though, that things didn‚Äôt quite work that way. There are few ‚Äúgrandmother neurons‚Äù in the cortex (although a 2005 Nature paper reported someone with a Jennifer Aniston neuron). The cortex can‚Äôt rely too much on grandmother neurons, because that requires a gazillion more neurons to accommodate such inefficiency and overspecialization. Moreover, a world of nothing but grandmother neurons on top precludes making multimodal associations (for example, when seeing a particular Monet reminds you of croissants and Debussy‚Äôs music and the disastrous date you had at an Impressionism show at the Met). Instead, we‚Äôve entered the world of neural networks.</p><p>Which brings me to my selection, which is emergence and complexity, as represented by ‚Äúswarm intelligence.‚Äù Observe a single ant and it doesn‚Äôt make much sense‚Äîwalking in one direction, suddenly careening in another for no obvious reason, doubling back on itself. Thoroughly unpredictable. The same happens with two ants, with a handful of ants. But a colony of ants makes fantastic sense. Specialized jobs, efficient means of exploiting new food sources, complex underground nests with temperature regulated within a few degrees. And critically, there‚Äôs no blueprint or central source of command‚Äîeach individual ant has algorithms for its behaviors. But this is not the wisdom of the crowd, where a bunch of reasonably informed individuals outperform a single expert. The ants aren‚Äôt reasonably informed about the big picture. Instead, the behavior algorithms of each ant consist of a few simple rules for interacting with the local environment and local ants. And out of this emerges a highly efficient colony.</p><p>Ant colonies excel at generating trails that connect locations in the shortest possible way, accomplished with simple rules about when to lay down a pheromone trail and what to do when encountering someone else‚Äôs trail‚Äîapproximations of optimal solutions to the Traveling Salesman problem. In ‚Äúant-based routing,‚Äù simulations using virtual ants with similar rules can generate optimal ways of connecting the nodes in a network, something of great interest to telecommunications companies. It also applies to the developing brain, which must wire up vast numbers of neurons with vaster numbers of connections without constructing millions of miles of connecting axons. And migrating fetal neurons generate an efficient solution with a different version of ant-based routing.</p><p>A wonderful example is how local rules about attraction and repulsion (that is, positive and negative charges) allow simple molecules in an organic soup to occasionally form more complex ones. Life may have originated this way, without the requirement of bolts of lightning to catalyze the formation of complex molecules.</p><p>And why is self-organization so beautiful to my atheistic self? Because if complex adaptive systems don‚Äôt require a blueprint, they don‚Äôt require a Blueprint Maker. If they don‚Äôt require lightning bolts, they don‚Äôt require Someone hurtling lightning bolts.</p><p>LANGUAGE AND NATURAL SELECTION</p><p>KEITH DEVLIN</p><p>Executive director, H-STAR Institute, Stanford University; author, The Man of Numbers: Fibonacci‚Äôs Arithmetic Revolution</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_69.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_71.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
