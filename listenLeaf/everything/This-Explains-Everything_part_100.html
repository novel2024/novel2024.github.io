How do new things, new qualities “emerge”? Were they present in the components from which they were made? The simplest reductive arguments presume they had to be. But if so, they can be devilishly hard to find. Can you find “wateriness” in the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen that form water molecules? This is why “emergence” so often seems magical and mysterious.</p><p>But it’s not, really. One of the most beautiful explanations of emergence is found in a Buddhist sutra probably composed more than 10,000 years ago, “The Questions of Milinda.” (I’m paraphrasing on the basis of an online translation.)</p><p>Milinda is a great emperor. He was an actual historical figure, the Greco-Bactrian emperor Menander, who ruled a Central Asian kingdom founded by generals from Alexander the Great’s army. In the sutra, Milinda meets with Nagasena, a great Buddhist sage—probably on the plains of modern Afghanistan. Milinda had summoned Nagasena because he was getting interested in Buddhism but was puzzled because the Buddha seemed to deny the reality of the self. For most of us, the sense of self is the very bedrock of reality. (When Descartes said “I think, therefore I am,” he doubtless meant something like “The self is the only thing we know that exists for certain.”)</p><p>So we should imagine Milinda sitting in a royal chariot, followed by a huge retinue of courtiers and soldiers, meeting Nagasena, with his retinue of Buddhist monks, for a great debate about the nature of the self, reality, and creativity. It’s a splendid vision.</p><p>Milinda asks Nagasena to explain the Buddha’s idea of the “self.” Nagasena asks, “Sire, how did you come here?” Milinda says, “In a chariot, of course, reverend Sire.”</p><p>“Sire, if you removed the wheels would it still be a chariot?”</p><p>“Yes, of course it would,” says Milinda, with some irritation, wondering where this conversation is going.</p><p>“And if you removed the framework, or the flagstaff, or the yoke, or the reins, or the goadstick, would it still be a chariot?”</p><p>Eventually Milinda starts to get it. He admits that at some point his chariot would no longer be a chariot, because it would have lost the quality of chariotness and could no longer do what chariots do.</p><p>And now Nagasena cannot resist gloating, because Milinda has failed to define in what exact sense his chariot really exists. Then comes the punch line: “Your Majesty has spoken well about the chariot. It is just so with me. . . . This denomination, ‘Nagasena,’ is a mere name. In ultimate reality, this person cannot be apprehended.”</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_99.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_101.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
