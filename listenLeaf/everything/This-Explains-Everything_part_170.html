Any observer who moves in a straight line at a constant speed with respect to you will also see the free objects move at a constant speed in a straight line with respect to him. Special observers form a big class, one whose members are all moving with respect to one another. These special observers are called inertial observers.</p><p>An immediate and momentous consequence is that there is no absolute meaning to not moving. An object may be at rest with respect to one inertial observer, but other inertial observers will see it moving‚Äîalways in a straight line at constant speed. This can be formulated as a principle:</p><p>There is no way, by observing objects in motion, to distinguish observers at rest from other inertial observers.</p><p>Any inertial observer can plausibly say that he is the one at rest and the others are moving. This is called Galileo‚Äôs principle of relativity. It explains why the Earth can move without our experiencing the gross effects.</p><p>To appreciate how revolutionary this principle was, notice that physicists of the 16th century could disprove, by a simple observation, Copernicus‚Äôs claim that the Earth moves around the sun: Just drop a ball from the top of a tower. If the Earth was rotating around its axis and orbiting the sun at the speeds Copernicus required, the ball would land far from the tower, instead of at its base. QED: The Earth is at rest.</p><p>But this proof assumes that motion is absolute, defined with respect to a special observer at rest, with respect to whom objects with no forces on them come to rest. By altering the definition of motion, Galileo could argue that this same experiment shows that the Earth might indeed be moving.</p><p>The principle of inertia was the core of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century; moreover, it contained the seeds of revolutions to come. To see why, notice the qualifier in the statement of Galileo‚Äôs principle of relativity: ‚Äúby observing objects in motion.‚Äù For many years, it was thought that someday we would make other kinds of observations that would determine which inertial observers are really moving and which are really at rest. Einstein constructed his special theory of relativity simply by removing this qualifier. His principle of relativity states:</p><p>There is no way to distinguish observers at rest from other inertial observers.</p><p>And there‚Äôs more. A decade after special relativity, the principle of inertia was the seed for the next revolution‚Äîthe discovery of general relativity. The principle was generalized by replacing ‚Äúmoving in a straight line with constant speed‚Äù to ‚Äúmoving along a geodesic in spacetime.‚Äù A geodesic is the generalization of a straight line in a curved geometry‚Äîit‚Äôs the shortest distance between two points. So now the principle of inertia reads:</p><p>There is a special class of observers, relative to whom all free objects appear to move along geodesics in spacetime. These are observers who are in free fall in a gravitational field.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_169.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_171.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
