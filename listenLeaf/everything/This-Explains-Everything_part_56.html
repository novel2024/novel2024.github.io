The walls are glowing, and as they emit radiation, they also absorb radiation. After some time, there will be an equilibrium distribution of radiation inside the container. This was already well known before Einstein. Max Planck had introduced the idea of quantization that explained the energy distribution of the radiation inside such a volume. Einstein went a step further. He studied how orderly the distribution of the radiation is inside such a container.</p><p>For physicists, entropy is a measure of disorder. And the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann showed that the entropy of a system is a measure of how probable its state is. To take a simple example, it is much more probable that books, notes, pencils, photos, pens, etc. are scattered all over my desk than that they form orderly stacks. Or if we consider a million atoms inside a container, it is much more probable that they are more or less equally distributed throughout the container‚Äôs volume than all collected in one corner. In both cases, the first state is the less orderly, and when the atoms fill a larger volume they have an even higher entropy.</p><p>Einstein realized that the entropy of radiation (including light) changes with the volume of its container in the same mathematical way as for atoms; in both cases, the entropy increases with the logarithm of the volume. For Einstein, this could not be just a coincidence. Since we can understand the entropy of the gas because it consists of atoms, radiation, too, consists of particles‚Äîwhich he called energy quanta (today called photons).</p><p>Einstein immediately applied his idea to the photoelectric effect. But he also realized a fundamental conflict of the idea of energy quanta with the well-studied and observed phenomenon of interference.</p><p>The problem was how to understand the two-slit interference pattern. This is the phenomenon that, according to Richard Feynman, contains ‚Äúthe only mystery‚Äù of quantum physics. The challenge is very simple. When we shine a beam of photons at a plate in which there are two slits, and both slits are open, we obtain bright and dark stripes on an observation screen behind the plate; these are the interference fringes. When we have only one slit open, we get no stripes, no interference fringes, but instead a broad distribution of photons. This result can easily be understood, given the wave picture of light: Waves pass through each of the two slits, alternately extinguishing and reinforcing each other on the observation screen. That way, we obtain dark and bright fringes.</p><p>But what to expect if the light beam‚Äôs intensity is so low that only one photon at a time passes through the apparatus? Following Einstein‚Äôs realist position, it would be natural to assume that a photon has to pass through either one open slit or the other, but not both. We can do the experiment by sending photons in, one at a time. According to Einstein, no interference fringes should appear, because a single photon, as a particle, would have to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù one open slit or the other, and thus there would be no reinforcement or extinguishing, as there was in the wave picture. This was indeed Einstein‚Äôs opinion, and he suggested that the fringes appear only if many photons are passing through at the same time and somehow interact with each other such that they make up the interference pattern.</p><p>Today, we know from many experiments that the interference pattern arises even at such low intensities that only one photon per second passes through the apparatus. If we wait long enough and look at the distribution of all of them on the observation screen, we get the interference pattern. The modern explanation is that the interference pattern arises only if there is no information, anywhere in the universe, about which slit the particle passes through (the colloquial statement that a photon passes through both slits at once has to be taken with a grain of salt). But even as Einstein was wrong here, his idea of the energy quanta of light, i.e., photons, pointed far into the future.</p><p>In a letter to his friend Conrad Habicht in the same year of 1905, the miraculous year wherein he also published his special theory of relativity, he called the paper on photons ‚Äúrevolutionary.‚Äù As far as is known, this was the only work of his that he ever called revolutionary, and therefore it is quite fitting that in 1921 it brought him a Nobel Prize. That the situation was not as clear a few years earlier is witnessed by a famous letter signed by Planck, Walther Nernst, Heinrich Rubens, and Emil Warburg, suggesting Einstein for membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1913. They wrote: ‚ÄúThat he might have in his speculations, occasionally, overshot the target, as for example in his light-quantum hypothesis, should not be counted against him too much, because without occasionally taking a risk, even in the most exact science no real innovation can be introduced.‚Äù Einstein‚Äôs deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation in 1905 of the entropy of radiation by proposing light quanta makes a strong case for the usefulness of occasional speculation.</p><p>GO SMALL</p><p>JEREMY BERNSTEIN</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_55.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_57.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
