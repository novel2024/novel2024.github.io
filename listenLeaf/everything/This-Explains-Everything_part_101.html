The ‚Äúemergent‚Äù properties are not magical. They are really there, and eventually they may start rearranging the environments that generated them. But they don‚Äôt exist ‚Äúin‚Äù the bits and pieces that made them; they emerge from the arrangement of those bits and pieces in very precise ways. And that is also true of the emergent entities known as ‚Äúyou‚Äù and ‚Äúme.‚Äù</p><p>FRAMES OF REFERENCE</p><p>DIMITAR D. SASSELOV</p><p>Professor of astronomy, Harvard University; director, Harvard Origins of Life Initiative; author, The Life of Super-Earths: How the Hunt for Alien Worlds and Artificial Cells Will Revolutionize Life on Our Planet</p><p>Deep and elegant explanations relate to natural or social phenomena, and the observer often has no place in them. As a young student, I was fascinated to understand how frames of reference work‚Äîthat is, to learn what it means to be an observer.</p><p>The reference-frame concept is central in physics and astronomy. For example, the study of flows relies most often on two basic frames: one in which the flow is described as it moves through space, called an Eulerian frame; and another, called a Lagrangian frame, which moves with the flow, stretching and bending as it goes. The equations of motion in the Eulerian frame seemed intuitively obvious to me, but I felt exhilarated when I understood the same flow described by equations in the Lagrangian frame.</p><p>It is beautiful. Let‚Äôs think of a flow of water, a winding river. You are perched on a hill by the riverbank, observing the water flow, which is marked by a multitude of floating tree leaves. The banks of the river, the details of the surroundings, provide a natural coordinate system, just as on a geographical map; you could almost create a mental image of fixed criss-crossing lines, your frame of reference. The river‚Äôs flow moves through that fixed map; you can describe the twists and turns of the currents and their changing speed, all thanks to this fixed Eulerian frame of reference, named after Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783).</p><p>It turns out that you could describe the flow with equal success if, instead of standing safely atop the hill, you plunged into the river and floated downstream, observing the whirling motions of the tree leaves all around you. Your frame of reference‚Äîthe one named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736‚Äì1813)‚Äîis no longer fixed; instead, you‚Äôre describing all motions as relative to you and to one another. Your description of the flow will match exactly the description you achieved by observing from the hill, although the mathematical equations appear unrecognizably different.</p><p>To my younger self, back then, the transformation between the two frames looked like magic. It was not deep, perhaps, but it was elegant and extremely helpful. However, it was also just the start of a journey‚Äîa journey that would pull the old frames of reference out from under me. It started with the naive picture of an unmoving Earth as the absolute frame of Aristotle, soon to be rejected and replaced by Galileo with a frame of reference in which motion is not absolute. Oh, how I loved floating with Lagrange down Euler‚Äôs river, only to be unsettled again by the special relativity of Einstein and trying to comprehend the loss of simultaneity. And a loss it was.</p><p>A fundamental shift in our frame of reference, especially the one that defines our place in the world, deeply affects each and every one of us personally. We live and learn. The next generation is born into the new with no attachment to the old.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_100.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_102.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
