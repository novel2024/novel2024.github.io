To everyone‚Äôs amazement, group discussions led people to opt for more risk, setting off a wave of speculation about group risk-taking by juries, business boards, and the military. Alas, some other story problems surfaced in which group deliberation increased caution. (Should a young married parent with two children gamble his savings on a hot stock tip?) Out of this befuddlement‚ÄîDoes group interaction increase risk or caution?‚Äîthere emerged a deeper principle of simple elegance: Group interaction tends to amplify people‚Äôs initial inclinations. This group polarization phenomenon was repeatedly confirmed. In one study, relatively prejudiced and unprejudiced students were grouped separately and asked to respond‚Äîbefore and after discussion‚Äîto racial dilemmas, such as a conflict over property rights versus open housing. Discussion with like-minded peers increased the attitude gap between the high- and low-prejudiced groups.</p><p>Today, the self-segregation of kindred spirits is rife. With increased mobility, conservative communities attract conservatives and progressive communities attract progressives. Political journalist Bill Bishop and sociologist Robert Cushing report that the percentage of landslide counties‚Äîthose voting 60 percent or more for one presidential candidate‚Äînearly doubled between 1976 and 2008.* And when neighborhoods become political echo chambers, the consequence is increased polarization, as David Schkade of University of California‚ÄìSan Diego and colleagues demonstrated by assembling small groups of Coloradoans in liberal Boulder and conservative Colorado Springs. The community discussions of climate change, affirmative action, and same-sex unions diverged Boulder folks further leftward and Colorado Springs folks further rightward.</p><p>Terrorism is group polarization writ large. Virtually never does it erupt suddenly, as a solo personal act. Rather, terrorist impulses arise among people whose shared grievances bring them together. In isolation from moderating influences, group interaction becomes a social amplifier. The Internet accelerates opportunities for like-minded peacemakers and neo-Nazis, geeks and goths, conspiracy schemers, and cancer survivors to find and influence one another. When socially networked, birds of a feather find their shared interests, attitudes, and suspicions magnified.</p><p>Ergo, one elegant and socially significant explanation of diverse observations is simply this: opinion-segregation + conversation ‚Üí polarization.</p><p>THE PRICE EQUATION</p><p>ARMAND MARIE LEROI</p><p>Professor of evolutionary developmental biology, Imperial College, London; author, Mutants: On Genetic Variety and the Human Body</p><p>Whenever we see highly ordered phenomena‚Äîa baby, a symphony, a scientific paper, a corporation, a government, a galaxy‚Äîwe are driven to ask: How does that order arise? One answer, albeit an abstract one, is that each of these is the product of a variation-selection process. By this I mean any process that begins with many variants and in which most die (or are thrown into the wastepaper basket or dissipate or collapse), leaving only a few fit (or strong or appealing or stable) enough to survive. The production of organic forms by natural selection is, of course, the most famous example of such a process. It‚Äôs also now a commonplace that human culture is driven by an analogous process; but, as the above examples suggest, variation-selection processes can be seen everywhere, once we know what to look for.</p><p>Many others have had this idea, but none has seen its implications as deeply as George Price, an American living in London, who in 1970 published an equation describing variation-selection processes of all kinds.* The Price equation, as it is now known, is simple, deep, and elegant‚Äîmy candidate explanation. It can be used to describe, inter alia, the tuning of an analog radio dial, chemical-reaction kinetics, the impact of neonatal mortality on the distribution of human birth weight, the reason we inhabit this universe out of the multitude we do not (assuming the others exist). But for me the real fascination of the Price equation lies not in the form he gave it in 1970 but in an extension he published two years later.*</p><p>One of the properties of variation-selection systems is that the selecting can happen at many different levels. Music is clearly the result of a variation-selection process. The composer sits at his piano considering what comes next and chooses one out of the world of possible notes, chords, or phrases that he might. Look at Beethoven‚Äôs manuscripts (Op. 47, the Kreutzer Sonata, is a good example)‚Äîthey‚Äôre scrawled with his second thoughts. In 1996, Brian Eno wittily made this process explicit when he used SSEYO‚Äôs Koan software to produce an ever-varying collection of pieces that he called ‚Äúgenerative music.‚Äù</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_50.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_52.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
