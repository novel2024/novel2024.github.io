(China recently estimated these losses as 10 percent of GDP.) We currently subsidize fossil fuels in dozens of ways, by allowing power companies, auto companies, and others to keep environmental costs off the books, by funding the infrastructure for autos at public expense while demanding that railroads build their own infrastructure, and so on.</p><p>We‚Äôve renewed our industrial base, investing in new industries rather than propping up old ones. Climate skeptics like Bjorn Lomborg like to cite the cost of dealing with global warming. But these costs are similar to the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù incurred by record companies in the switch to digital-music distribution, or the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù to newspapers implicit in the rise of the Web. That is, they are costs to existing industries, but they ignore the opportunities for new industries that exploit the new technology. I have yet to see a convincing case made that the costs of dealing with climate change aren‚Äôt principally the costs of protecting old industries.</p><p>By contrast, let‚Äôs assume that the climate skeptics are wrong. We face the displacement of millions of people, droughts, floods and other extreme weather, species loss, and economic harm that will make us long for the good old days of the current financial-industry meltdown.</p><p>Climate change really is a modern version of Pascal‚Äôs wager. On one side, the worst outcome is that we‚Äôve built a more robust economy. On the other, the worst outcome really is Hell. In short, we do better if we believe in climate change and act on that belief, even if we turn out to be wrong.</p><p>But I digress. The illustration has become the entire argument. Pascal‚Äôs wager is not just for mathematicians, nor for the religiously inclined. It is a useful tool for any thinking person.</p><p>EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES</p><p>S.
