Indeed, I would go as far as to suggest that this idea can help shift the human perception of nature. In the modernist perspective, the natural world is little more than a collection of virtually infinite resources available for human exploitation. The Gaian lens encourages us to reenvision Earthbound nature as an intertwined, finite whole from which we evolved and in which we remain fully embedded. Here, then, is a deep and beautiful perspective in desperate need of broad dissemination.</p><p>THE CONTINUITY EQUATIONS</p><p>LAURENCE C. SMITH</p><p>Professor of geography, UCLA; author, The World in 2050</p><p>These are already familiar to you‚Äîat least, in anecdotal form. Almost everyone has heard of the law of conservation of mass (sometimes with the word ‚Äúmatter‚Äù in place of ‚Äúmass‚Äù) and probably its partner, conservation of energy, too. These laws tell us that for practical, real-world (that is, non-quantum, non‚Äìgeneral relativity) phenomena, matter and energy can never be created or destroyed, only shuffled around. That concept has origins at least as far back as the ancient Greeks, was formally articulated in the 18th century (a major advance for modern chemistry), and today underpins virtually every aspect of the physical, life, and natural sciences. Conservation of mass (or matter) is what finally quashed the alchemists‚Äô quest to transform lead into gold; conservation of energy is what consigns the awesome power of a wizard‚Äôs staff to the imaginations of legions of Lord of the Rings fans.</p><p>The continuity equations take these laws an important step further, by providing explicit mathematical formulations that track the storage and/or transfers of mass (mass continuity) and energy (energy continuity) from one compartment or state to another. As such, they are not really a single pair of equations but are instead written into a variety of forms, ranging from the very simple to the very complex, in order to best represent the physical phenomenon they are supposed to describe. The most elegant forms, adored by mathematicians and physicists, have exquisite detail and are therefore the most complex. A classic example is the set of Navier-Stokes equations‚Äîsometimes called the Saint-Venant equations‚Äîused to understand the movements and accelerations of fluids. The beauty of Navier-Stokes lies in their explicit partitioning and tracking of mass, energy, and momentum through space and time. However, in practice, such detail also makes these equations difficult to solve, requiring either hefty computing power or simplifying assumptions to be made to the equations themselves.</p><p>But the power of the continuity equations is not limited to complex forms comprehensible solely to mathematicians and physicists. A forest manager, for example, might use a simple, so-called mass-balance form of a mass-continuity equation to study her forest by adding up the number, size, and density of trees, determining the rate at which seedlings establish themselves, and then subtracting the trees‚Äô mortality rate and number of truckloads of timber removed, so as to learn whether its total wood content (biomass) is increasing, decreasing, or stable. Automotive engineers routinely apply simple energy-balance equations when, for example, designing a hybrid electric car to recapture kinetic energy from its braking system. None of the energy is truly created or destroyed, just recaptured‚Äîin this case, from a combustion engine, which got it from breaking apart ancient chemical bonds, which got it from photosynthetic reactions, which got it from the sun. Any remaining energy not recaptured from the brakes is not really lost, of course, but instead transferred to the atmosphere as low-grade heat.</p><p>The cardinal assumption behind these laws and equations is that mass and energy are conserved within a closed system. In principle, the hybrid electric car satisfies energy continuity only if its consumption is tracked from start (the sun) to finish (dissipation of heat into the atmosphere). This is a cumbersome calculation, so the process is usually treated as an open system. The metals used in the car‚Äôs manufacture satisfy mass continuity only if tracked from their source (ores) to landfill. This tracking is more feasible, and such cradle-to-grave resource accounting‚Äîa high priority for many environmentalists‚Äîis thus more compatible with natural laws than our current economic model, which tends to treat such resource flows as open systems.</p><p>Like the car, our planet is, from a practical standpoint, an open system with respect to energy and a closed system with respect to mass. (Although Earth is still being bombarded by meteorites, that input is now small enough to be ignored.) The former is what makes life possible: Without the sun‚Äôs steady infusion of fresh, external energy, life as we know it would quickly end. An external source is required because although energy cannot be destroyed, it constantly degrades into weaker, less useful forms, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. (Consider the hybrid-electric car‚Äôs brake pads‚Äîtheir dissipated heat is not of much use to anyone.) The openness of this system is two-way, because Earth also streams thermal infrared energy back out to space. Its radiation is invisible to us, but to satellites with ‚Äúvision‚Äù in this range of the electromagnetic spectrum the Earth is a brightly glowing orb, much like the sun.</p><p>Interestingly, this closed/open dichotomy is yet another reason that the physics of climate change are unassailable. By burning fossil fuels, we shuffle carbon (mass) out of the subsurface‚Äîwhere it has virtually no interaction with the planet‚Äôs energy balance‚Äîto the atmosphere, where it does. It is well understood that carbon in the atmosphere alters the planet‚Äôs energy balance; the physics of this has been known since 1893, thanks to the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius. Without carbon-based and other greenhouse gases, our planet would be a moribund, ice-covered rock. Greenhouse gases prevent this by selectively altering the Earth‚Äôs energy balance in the troposphere, the lowest few miles of the atmosphere, where the vast majority of its gases reside‚Äîthus raising the amount of thermal infrared radiation that Earth emits. Because some of this energy streams back down to Earth as well as out to space, the lower troposphere warms to achieve energy balance. Continuity of energy commands this.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_127.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_129.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
