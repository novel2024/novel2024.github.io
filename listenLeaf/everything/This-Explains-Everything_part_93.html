Darwin, exasperated at the crass philosophy of science peddled by his critics, exclaims, ‚ÄúHow odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!‚Äù* And when the conversation turns to evolution, Popper observes, ‚ÄúAll life is problem solving,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúfrom the amoeba to Einstein, the growth of knowledge is always the same.‚Äù*</p><p>There is a confluence in their thinking. Though traveling by different pathways, they arrived at the same insight. It has to do with the primacy and fundamental role of theories‚Äîof ideas, hypotheses, perspectives, views, dispositions, and the like‚Äîin the acquisition and growth of knowledge. Darwin was right to stress that such primacy is needed ‚Äúif [the observation] is to be of any service.‚Äù But the role of a ‚Äúview‚Äù also goes far deeper. As Darwin knew, it is impossible to observe at all without some kind of view. If you are unconvinced, try this demonstration, one that Popper liked to use in lectures. ‚ÄúObserve!‚Äù Have you managed that? No. Because, of course, you need to know, ‚ÄúObserve what?‚Äù All observation is in the light of some theory; all observation must be in the light of some theory. So all observation is theory-laden‚Äînot sometimes, not contingently, but always and necessarily.</p><p>This is not to depreciate observation, data, facts. On the contrary, it gives them their proper due. Only in the light of a theory, a problem, the quest for a solution, can they speak to us in revealing ways.</p><p>Thus the insight is immensely simple. But it has wide relevance and great potency. Hence its elegance and beauty.</p><p>Here are two examples, first from Darwin‚Äôs realm, then from Popper‚Äôs.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Consider the tedious but tenacious argument: ‚Äúgenes vs. environment.‚Äù I‚Äôll take a well-studied case. Indigo buntings migrate annually over long distances. To solve the problem of navigation, natural selection equipped them with the ability to construct a mental compass by studying the stars in the night sky, boy-scout fashion, during their first few months of life. The fount of this spectacular adaptation is a rich source of information that natural selection, over evolutionary time, has packed into the birds‚Äô genes‚Äîin particular, information about the rotation of the stellar constellations. Thus buntings that migrate today can use the same instincts and the same environmental regularities to fashion the same precision-built instrument as did their long-dead ancestors.</p><p>And all adaptations work in this way. By providing the organism with innate information about the world, they open up resources for the organism to meet its own distinctive adaptive needs; thus natural selection creates the organism‚Äôs own tailor-made, species-specific environment. And different adaptive problems therefore give rise to different environments; so different species, for example, have different environments.</p><p>Thus what constitutes an environment depends on the organism‚Äôs adaptations. Without innate information, carried by the genes, specifying what constitutes an environment, no environments would exist. And thus environments, far from being separate from biology, autonomous and independent, are themselves in part fashioned by biology. Environment is therefore a biological issue, an issue that necessarily begins with biologically stored information.</p><p>But aren‚Äôt we anyway all interactionists now‚Äîno longer genes vs. environment but gene/environment interaction? Yes, of course; interaction is what natural selection designed genes to do. Bunting genes are freighted with information about how to learn from stars because stars are as vital a part of a bunting‚Äôs environment as is the egg in which it develops or the water it drinks. Buntings without stars are destined to be buntings without descendants. But interaction is not parity; the information must come first. Just try this parity test. Try specifying ‚Äúan‚Äù environment without first specifying whether it is the environment of a bunting or a human, a male or a female, an adaptation for bird navigation or for human language. The task is impossible; the specification must start from the information stored in adaptations. And here‚Äôs another challenge to parity. Genes use environments for a purpose: self-replication. Environments, however, have no purposes; so they do not use genes. Thus bunting genes are machines for converting stars into more bunting genes; but stars are not machines for converting bunting genes into more stars.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The second example has to do with the notion of objectivity in science. Listen further to Darwin‚Äôs complaint about misunderstandings over scientific observation: ‚ÄúHow profoundly ignorant [this critic] must be of the very soul of observation! About thirty years ago, there was much talk that geologists ought only to observe and not theorise; and I well remember some one saying that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles and describe the colours.‚Äù*</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_92.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_94.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
