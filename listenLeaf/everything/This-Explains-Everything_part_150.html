The idea is that of ‚Äúdeep time‚Äù‚Äîthat the Earth is extremely old and the life of our species on it has been extremely short. When that idea first emerged, it stood against everything that was then believed, and it was to eventually change people‚Äôs view of themselves as much as did the earlier discovery that the Earth revolves around the sun.</p><p>We know when the idea of deep time was born, or at least first vindicated, because a University of Edinburgh professor named John Playfair recorded his reaction in 1788. ‚ÄúThe mind seemed to grow giddy,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúby looking so far into the abyss of time.‚Äù* He had traveled to the Scottish coast with his geologist friend James Hutton, who later put his ideas together in a book called Theory of the Earth. Hutton was showing him a set of distinct patterns in the rocks that could be most simply explained by assuming that the present land had been laid down in the sea, then lifted, distorted, eroded, and once again covered by new seafloor sediments. The Earth was not 6,000 years old, as then-accepted Biblical calculations decreed; nor had the strata precipitated out in a vast flood, as prevailing scientific views, informed by the best chemistry of the time, said.</p><p>It was an enormous shift to see the world as Hutton did. Appreciating the vastness of space is easy. When we look up at the stars, the immensity of the universe is both obvious and awe-inspiring. The immensity of time does not lie within human experience. Nature, observed on a human scale, passes only through the repeated cycle of the seasons, interrupted by occasional catastrophic earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods. It is for that reason that creationist and catastrophic theories of Earth‚Äôs origins appeared more plausible than those that were slow and gradual. But Hutton had faith in what he saw in the rocks, exhorting others to ‚Äúopen the book of Nature and read in her records.‚Äù</p><p>His thinking about time created fertile ground for other grand theories. With huge spans of time available, imperceptibly slow processes could shape the natural world. After Hutton came modern geology, then the theory of evolution to explain how new species slowly arose, and eventually a theory of the gradual movement of the continents themselves. All are grounded in deep time.</p><p>Hutton‚Äôs views were a huge challenge to religious orthodoxy, too, for when he wrote at the close of his book that ‚Äúwe find no vestige of a beginning‚Äîno prospect of an end,‚Äù he challenged the idea of both a creation and a judgment day.</p><p>The beauty of his idea remains. If we look into the abyss of time we may not grow giddy, but we can feel our own insignificance in the Earth‚Äôs 4.6-billion-year history and the significance of the precise moment in this vast span of time in which we live.</p><p>PLACING PSYCHOTHERAPY ON A SCIENTIFIC BASIS: FIVE EASY LESSONS</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_149.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_151.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
