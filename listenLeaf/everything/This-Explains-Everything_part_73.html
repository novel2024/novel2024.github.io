It is the rational response to the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma, for instance, where each individual in a pair can either cooperate or defect, leading to four potential outcomes. No matter what the other person does, selfish behavior (defecting) always yields greater return. But if both players defect, both do worse than if they had cooperated. Yet when political scientist Robert Axelrod and his colleagues ran hundreds of rounds of the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma expressed using a mathematical equation on a computer, the repetition of the game led to a different result.</p><p>Experts from a wide range of disciplines submitted 76 different game strategies for Axelrod to try out against each other‚Äîsome of them very elaborate. Each strategy would play against all the others for 200 rounds. In the end, the strategy that received the highest score was also the simplest. Tit for Tat, an if-then strategy where the player cooperates on the first move and thereafter does what its partner does, was the winner. The importance of reciprocity to the evolution of cooperation was detected by humans but simulated and verified with machines.</p><p>This elegant explanation was then documented in living egoists with an elegant experiment. Evolutionary biologist Manfred Milinski noticed Tit for Tat behavior in his subjects, three-spined sticklebacks. When he watched a pair of these fish approach a predator, he observed four options: they could swim side by side, one could take the lead while the other followed closely behind (or vice versa), or they could both retreat. These four scenarios satisfied the four inequalities that define the Prisoner‚Äôs Dilemma.</p><p>For the experiment, Milinski wanted to use pairs of sticklebacks, but they‚Äôre impossible to train. So he placed in the tank a single stickleback and a set of mirrors that would act like two different types of companions. In the first treatment, a parallel mirror was used to simulate a cooperative companion that swam alongside the subject stickleback. In the second treatment, an oblique mirror system set at a 32-degree angle simulated a defecting partner‚Äîthat is, as the stickleback approached the predator, the companion appeared to fall increasingly and uncooperatively behind. Depending on the mirror, the stickleback felt he was sharing the risk equally or increasingly going it alone.</p><p>When the sticklebacks were partnered with a defector, they preferred the safer half of the tank, farthest away from the predator. But in the trials with the cooperating mirror, the sticklebacks were twice as likely to venture into the half of the tank closest to the predator. The sticklebacks were more adventurous if they had a sidekick. In nature, cooperative behavior translates to more food and more space, and therefore greater individual reproductive success. Contrary to predictions that selfish behavior or retreat was optimal, Milinski‚Äôs observation that sticklebacks most often approached the predator together was in line with Axelrod‚Äôs conclusion that Tit for Tat was the optimal evolutionary strategy.</p><p>Milinski‚Äôs evidence, published in 1987 in the journal Nature,* was the first to demonstrate that cooperation based on reciprocity definitely evolved among egoists, albeit small ones. A large body of research now shows that many biological systems, especially human societies, are organized around various cooperative strategies; the scientific methods continue to become more and more sophisticated, but the original experiments and Tit For Tat strategy are beautifully simple.</p><p>TRUE OR FALSE: BEAUTY IS TRUTH</p><p>JUDITH RICH HARRIS</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_72.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_74.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
