My gut reaction is ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt possibly obey the laws of physics.‚Äù Yet under close enough scrutiny, it does. For example, how can one gram of inflating matter turn into two grams when it expands? Surely, mass can‚Äôt just be created from nothing? Interestingly, Einstein offered us a loophole via his special relativity theory, which says that energy e and mass m are related according to the famous formula e = mc2, where c is the speed of light. This means you can increase the mass of something by adding energy to it. For example, you can make a rubber band slightly heavier by stretching it: You need to apply energy to stretch it, and this energy goes into the rubber band and increases its mass. A rubber band has negative pressure, because you need to do work to expand it. Similarly, the inflating substance has to have negative pressure in order to obey the laws of physics, and this negative pressure has to be so huge that the energy required to expand it to twice its volume is exactly enough to double its mass. Remarkably, Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity says that this negative pressure causes a negative gravitational force. This in turn causes the repeated doubling, ultimately creating everything we can observe from almost nothing.</p><p>To me, the hallmark of a deep explanation is that it answers more than you ask. And inflation has proven to be the gift that keeps on giving, churning out answer after answer. It explained why space is so flat, which we‚Äôve measured to about 1 percent accuracy. It explained why, on average, our distant universe looks the same in all directions, with only 0.002 percent fluctuations from place to place. It explained the origins of these 0.002 percent fluctuations as quantum fluctuations stretched by inflation from microscopic to macroscopic scales, then amplified by gravity into today‚Äôs galaxies and cosmic large-scale structure. It even explained the cosmic acceleration that nabbed the 2011 physics Nobel Prize as inflation, restarting in slow motion, doubling the size of our universe not every split second but every 8 billion years‚Äîwhich has transformed the debate from whether inflation happened or not to whether it happened once or twice.</p><p>It‚Äôs now becoming clear that inflation is an explanation that doesn‚Äôt stop‚Äîinflating or explaining.</p><p>Just as cell division didn‚Äôt make just one baby and stop, but a huge and diverse population of humans, it looks as though inflation didn‚Äôt make just one universe and stop, but a huge and diverse population of parallel universes, perhaps realizing all possible options for what we used to think of as physical constants. Which would explain yet another mystery: the fact that many constants in our universe are so fine-tuned for life that if they changed by small amounts, life as we know it would be impossible‚Äîthere would be no galaxies, or no atoms, say. Even though most of the parallel universes created by inflation are stillborn, there will be some where conditions are just right for life, and it‚Äôs not surprising that this is where we find ourselves.</p><p>Inflation has given us an embarrassment of riches‚Äîand embarrassing it is. Because this infinity of universes has brought about the so-called measurement problem, which I view as the greatest crisis facing modern physics. Physics is all about predicting the future from the past, but inflation seems to sabotage this. Our physical world is clearly teeming with patterns and regularities, yet when we try quantifying them to predict the probability that something particular will happen, inflation always gives the same useless answer: infinity divided by infinity.</p><p>The problem is that whatever experiment you make, inflation predicts that there will be infinite copies of you obtaining each physically possible outcome in an infinite number of parallel universes, and despite years of teeth-grinding in the cosmology community, no consensus has emerged on how to extract sensible answers from these infinities. So, strictly speaking, we physicists are no longer able to predict anything at all. Our baby universe has grown into an unpredictable teenager.</p><p>This is so bad that I think a radical new idea is needed. Perhaps we need to somehow get rid of the infinite. Perhaps, like a rubber band, space can‚Äôt be expanded ad infinitum without undergoing a big snap? Perhaps those infinite parallel universes get destroyed by some yet undiscovered process, or perchance they‚Äôre, for some reason, mere mirages? The very deepest explanations provide not just answers but questions as well. I think inflation still has some explaining left to do.</p><p>KEPLER ET AL.
