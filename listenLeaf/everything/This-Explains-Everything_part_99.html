There, evolution was universally assumed, but there was no remedial introduction to the topic‚Äîit was sink or swim. Determined not to drown, I sought out context‚Äîanything that would help me understand all these facts my instructors expected me to know. I found it in a used bookstore, in a book that I selected because it wasn‚Äôt too thick and daunting and because when I skimmed it I could tell that it was clearly written, unlike the massive, dense, and opaque reference books my classes foisted on me. It was John Tyler Bonner‚Äôs On Development: The Biology of Form, and it blew my mind‚Äîand also warped me permanently so that I see biology through the lens of development.</p><p>The first thing the book taught me wasn‚Äôt an explanation, which was something of a relief; my classes were just full of explanations already. Bonner‚Äôs book is about questions‚Äîgood questions, some of which had answers and others that just hung there ripely. For instance, how is biological form defined by genetics? It‚Äôs the implicit question in the title, but the book refined the questions we need to answer in order to explain the problem. Maybe that‚Äôs explanation at a different level: Science isn‚Äôt a body of archived facts; it‚Äôs the path we follow to acquire new knowledge.</p><p>Bonner also led me to D‚ÄôArcy Wentworth Thompson and his classic book, On Growth and Form, which provided my favorite aphorism for a scientific view of the universe, ‚ÄúEverything is the way it is because it got that way.‚Äù It‚Äôs a subtle way of emphasizing the importance of process and history in understanding why everything is the way it is. You simply cannot grasp the concepts of science if your approach is to dissect the details in a static snapshot of its current state; your only hope is to understand the underlying mechanisms that generate that state, and how it came to be. The necessity of that understanding is implicit in developmental biology, where all we do is study the process of change in the developing embryo, but I also found it essential as well in genetics, comparative physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry. And of course it is paramount in evolutionary biology.</p><p>So my most fundamental explanation is a mode of thinking: To understand how something works, you must first understand how it got that way.</p><p>THE IDEA OF EMERGENCE</p><p>DAVID CHRISTIAN</p><p>Professor of history at Macquarie University, Sydney; author, Maps of Time</p><p>One of the most beautiful and profound ideas I know, and one whose power is not widely enough appreciated, is the idea of emergence and emergent properties.</p><p>When created, our universe was pretty simple. For several hundred million years, there were no stars, hardly any atoms more complex than helium, and of course no planets, no living organisms, no people, no poetry.</p><p>Then, over 13.7 billion years, all these things appeared, one by one. Each had qualities that had never been seen before. This is creativity in its most basic and mysterious form. Galaxies and stars were the first large, complex objects, and they had strange new properties. Stars fused hydrogen atoms into helium atoms, creating vast amounts of energy and forming hot spots dotted throughout the universe. In their death throes, the largest stars created all the elements of the periodic table, while the energy they pumped into the cold space around them helped assemble these elements into utterly new forms of matter with entirely new properties. Now it was possible to form planets, bacteria, dinosaurs, and us.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_98.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_100.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
