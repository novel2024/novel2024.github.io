But the theory of natural selection was too beautiful to be wrong. The brother was sure the troublesome facts would have to change. And so they did.</p><p>But it doesn‚Äôt always work that way. Elegance can be misleading. Consider a simple mathematical example. Given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, what rule would you guess is operating to generate the series? There are several theoretically possible answers. One would be the simple rule: Take the previous number, x, and compute x + 2. But equally valid for these data would be the much more complicated rule: Take the previous number, x, and compute</p><p>For the sequence as given so far, the first rule is clearly the more elegant. And if someone, let‚Äôs call her Tracey, were to maintain that since both rules work equally well she was going to make a personal choice of the second, we would surely think she was being deliberately contrarian and anti-elegant. Tracey Emin, not Michelangelo.</p><p>But suppose Tracey were to say, ‚ÄúI bet if we look a little further, we shall find I was right all along.‚Äù And suppose, when we do look further, we find to our surprise that the next number in the sequence is not 10, but 8.91 and the next after that not 12 but 8.67. That is, the sequence we actually discover goes 2, 4, 6, 8, 8.91, 8.67. Then what had previously seemed the better rule would no longer fit the facts at all. Yet‚Äîsurprise, surprise!‚Äîthe second rule would still fit nicely. In this case, we should be forced to concede that Tracey‚Äôs anti-elegance had won the day.</p><p>How often does the real world tease us by seeming simpler than it really is? A famous case is Francis Crick‚Äôs 1957 theory of how DNA passes on instructions for protein synthesis using a ‚Äúcomma-free code.‚Äù As Crick wrote many years later, ‚ÄúNaturally [we] were excited by the idea of a comma-free code. It seemed so pretty, almost elegant. You fed in the magic numbers 4 (the 4 bases) and 3 (the triplet) and out came the magic number 20, the number of the amino acids.‚Äù* But alas, this lovely theory could not be squared with experimental facts. The truth was altogether less elegant.</p><p>A tease? I‚Äôm not, of course, suggesting that nature was deliberately stringing Crick along. As Einstein said, God is subtle but he is not malicious. In this case, the failure of the most elegant explanation to be the true one is presumably just a matter of bad luck. And, assuming this doesn‚Äôt happen often, perhaps in general we can still expect truth and beauty to go together (as no doubt many of the other answers to this Edge Question will prove).</p><p>However, there is one class of cases where the elegance of an untrue theory may not be luck at all‚Äîwhere, indeed, complex phenomena have actually been designed to masquerade as simple ones, or at any rate to masquerade as such to human beings. And such cases will arise just when, in the course of evolution, it has been to the biological advantage of humans to see certain things in a particularly simple way. The designer of the pseudo-elegant explananda has been not God but natural selection.</p><p>Here is my favorite example. Individual humans appear to other humans to be controlled by the remarkable structures we call minds. But the surprising and wonderful thing is that human minds are quite easy for others to read. We‚Äôve all been doing it since we were babies, using the folk theory known to psychologists as ‚ÄúTheory of Mind‚Äù (or sometimes as ‚Äúbelief desire psychology‚Äù). Theory of Mind is simple and elegant, and can be understood by a two-year-old. There‚Äôs no question that it provides a highly effective way of explaining the way people behave. And this skill at mind-reading has been essential to human survival in social groups. Yet the fact is, Theory of Mind could never have worked so well unless natural selection had shaped human brains to be able to read‚Äîand to be readable by‚Äîone another in this way. Which is where the explanatory sleight-of-hand comes in. For as an explanation of how the brain works, Theory of Mind just doesn‚Äôt add up. It‚Äôs a purpose-built, oversimplified, deep, elegant myth‚Äîa myth whose inadequacy may not become apparent, perhaps, until those ‚Äúextra numbers‚Äù are added by madness or by brain damage‚Äîcontingencies that selection has not allowed for.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_77.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_79.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
