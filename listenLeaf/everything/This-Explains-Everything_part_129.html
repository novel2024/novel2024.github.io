The question is, What choices will we make about how extensively and rapidly to shuffle them out of the ground? The physics of natural resources, climate change, and other problems can often be reduced to simple, elegant equations‚Äîif only we had tools masterful enough to dictate their solution.</p><p>PASCAL‚ÄôS WAGER</p><p>TIM O‚ÄôREILLY</p><p>Founder and CEO of O‚ÄôReilly Media</p><p>In 1661 or 1662, in his Pens√©es, philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal articulated what would come to be known as Pascal‚Äôs Wager, the question of whether or not to believe in God in the face of the failure of reason and science to provide a definitive answer:</p><p>You must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? . . . You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.</p><p>While this proposition of Pascal‚Äôs is clothed in obscure religious language and on a religious topic, it is a significant and early expression of decision theory. And stripped of its particulars, it provides a simple and effective way to reason about contemporary problems like climate change.</p><p>We don‚Äôt need to be 100 percent sure that the worst fears of climate scientists are correct in order to act. All we need to think about are the consequences of being wrong.</p><p>Let‚Äôs assume for a moment that there is no human-caused climate change, or that the consequences are not dire, and we‚Äôve made big investments to avert it. What‚Äôs the worst that happens? In order to deal with climate change:</p><p>We‚Äôve made major investments in renewable energy. This is an urgent issue even in the absence of global warming, as the International Energy Agency has now revised the date of ‚Äúpeak oil‚Äù to 2020, only eight years from now.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_128.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_130.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
