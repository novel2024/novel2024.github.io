It can thus come to function as a CS, and if you eat it‚Äîor even think about eating it‚Äîyou may feel queasy, a CR. You may find yourself avoiding that food, and thus a food aversion is born. In fact, simply pairing pictures of particular types of food (such as French fries) with aversive photographs (such as of a horribly burned body) can change how appealing you find that food.</p><p>Thus Pavlov‚Äôs discovery of anticipatory salivation can be easily extended to a wide range of phenomena. But that said, we should point out that his original conception of classical conditioning was not quite right. He thought that sensory input was directly connected to specific responses, leading the stimuli to produce the response automatically. We now know that the connection is not so direct; classical conditioning involves many cognitive processes, such as attention and those underlying interpretation and understanding. In fact, classical conditioning is a form of implicit learning. As such, it allows us to navigate through life with less cognitive effort (and stress) than would otherwise be required. Nevertheless, this sort of conditioning has by-products that can be powerful, surprising, and even sometimes dangerous.</p><p>NATURE IS CLEVERER THAN WE ARE</p><p>TERRENCE J. SEJNOWSKI</p><p>Computational neuroscientist; Francis Crick Professor, the Salk Institute; coauthor (with Patricia S. Churchland), The Computational Brain</p><p>We have the clear impression that our deliberative mind makes the most important decisions in our life: what work we do, where we live, whom we marry. But contrary to this belief, the biological evidence points toward a decision process in an ancient brain system called the basal ganglia, brain circuits that consciousness cannot access. Nonetheless, the mind dutifully makes up plausible explanations for the decisions.</p><p>The scientific trail that led to this conclusion began with honeybees. Worker bees forage the spring fields for nectar, which they identify with the color, fragrance, and shape of a flower. The learning circuit in the bee brain converges on VUMmx1, a single neuron that receives the sensory input and, a bit later, the value of the nectar, and learns to predict the nectar value of that flower the next time the bee encounters it. The delay is important, because the key is prediction, rather than a simple association. This is also the central core of temporal-difference (TD) learning, which entails learning a sequence of decisions leading to a goal and is particularly effective in uncertain environments, like the world we live in.</p><p>Buried deep in your midbrain, there‚Äôs a small collection of neurons‚Äîfound in our earliest vertebrate ancestors, and projecting throughout the cortical mantle and basal ganglia‚Äîthat are important for decision making. These neurons release a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which has a powerful influence on our behavior. Dopamine has been called a ‚Äúreward molecule,‚Äù but more important than reward itself is the ability of these neurons to predict reward: If I had that job, how happy would I be? Dopamine neurons, which are central to motivation, implement TD learning, just as VUMmx1 does.</p><p>TD learning solves the problem of finding the shortest path to a goal. It‚Äôs an on-line algorithm, because it learns by exploring and discovers the value of intermediate decisions in reaching the goal. It does this by creating an internal value function, which can be used to predict the consequences of actions. Dopamine neurons evaluate the current state of the entire cortex and inform the brain about the best course of action from the current state. In many cases, the best course of action is a guess, but because guesses can be improved, TD learning creates, over time, a value function of oracular powers. Dopamine may be the source of the ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù you sometime experience, the stuff that intuition is made from.</p><p>When you‚Äôre considering various options, prospective brain circuits evaluate each scenario, and the transient level of dopamine registers the predicted value of each decision. The level of dopamine is also related to your level of motivation, so not only will a high level of dopamine indicate a high expected reward, but you will also have a higher level of motivation to pursue it. This is quite literally the case in the motor system, where a higher tonic dopamine level produces faster movements. The addictive power of cocaine and amphetamines is a consequence of increased dopamine activity, hijacking the brain‚Äôs internal motivation system. Reduced levels of dopamine lead to anhedonia, an inability to experience pleasure; and the loss of dopamine neurons results in Parkinson‚Äôs disease, an inability to initiate actions and thoughts.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_164.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_166.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
