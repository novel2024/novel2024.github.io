Ironically, many years later, I played a role in showing that my ‚Äúideal‚Äù was seriously flawed. In 1984, Dan Shechtman, Ilan Blech, Denis Gratias, and John Cahn reported the discovery of a puzzling man-made alloy of aluminum and manganese with icosahedral symmetry.* Icosahedral symmetry, with its six fivefold symmetry axes, is the most famous forbidden crystal symmetry. As luck would have it, Dov Levine (Technion) and I had been developing a hypothetical idea of a new form of solid we dubbed quasicrystals, short for ‚Äúquasiperiodic crystals.‚Äù (A quasiperiodic atomic arrangement means the atomic positions can be described by a sum of oscillatory functions whose frequencies have an irrational ratio.) We were inspired by a two-dimensional tiling invented by Sir Roger Penrose known as the Penrose tiling, comprised of two tiles arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern. We showed that quasicrystals could exist in three dimensions and were not subject to the rules of crystallography. In fact, they could have any of the symmetries forbidden to crystals. Furthermore, we showed that the diffraction patterns predicted for icosahedral quasicrystals matched the Shechtman et al. observations.</p><p>Since 1984, quasicrystals with other forbidden symmetries have been synthesized in the laboratory. The 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Dan Shechtman for his experimental breakthrough that changed our thinking about possible forms of matter. More recently, colleagues and I have found evidence that quasicrystals may have been among the first minerals to have formed in the solar system.</p><p>The crystallography I first encountered in Weyl‚Äôs book, thought to be complete and immutable, turned out to be woefully incomplete, missing literally an uncountable number of possible symmetries for matter. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned: While elegance and simplicity are often useful criteria for judging theories, they can sometimes mislead us into thinking we are right when we are actually infinitely wrong.</p><p>MATHEMATICAL OBJECT OR NATURAL OBJECT?</p><p>SHING-TUNG YAU</p><p>Mathematician, Harvard University; coauthor (with Steve Nadis), The Shape of Inner Space</p><p>Most scientific facts are based on things we cannot see with the naked eye or hear with our ears or feel with our hands. Many of them are described and guided by mathematical theory. In the end, it becomes difficult to distinguish a mathematical object from objects in nature.</p><p>One example is the concept of a sphere. Is the sphere part of nature or is it a mathematical artifact? That is difficult for a mathematician to say. Perhaps the abstract mathematical concept is actually a part of nature. And it is not surprising that this abstract concept actually describes nature quite accurately.</p><p>SIMPLICITY</p><p>FRANK WILCZEK</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_43.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_45.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
