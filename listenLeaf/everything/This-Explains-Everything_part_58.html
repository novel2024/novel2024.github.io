If we assume that our universe is described by string theory, does it mean that we know everything about the world around us? Consider a much simpler example: Recall that water can be liquid, frozen, or gaseous. Chemically it‚Äôs the same substance, but dolphins can live and comprehend the universe in their own way only if they are surrounded by liquid water. In this example, we have only three choices: liquid, ice, or vapor.</p><p>With string theory, according to its latest developments, we may have about 10500 (or more) choices of the possible state of the world surrounding us. All of these choices follow from the same basic theory. However, the universes corresponding to each of these choices would look as if they were governed by different laws of physics; their common roots would be well hidden. Since there are so many different choices, some of them, one hopes, can describe the universe we live in. But most of them would lead to a universe in which we could not live, build measuring devices, record events, or efficiently use mathematics and physics to predict the future.</p><p>When Einstein and Wigner were trying to understand why our universe is comprehensible and why mathematics is so efficient, everybody assumed that the universe was unique and uniform, and that the laws of physics were the same everywhere. This assumption was called the cosmological principle. We did not know why the universe was the same everywhere, we just took it for granted. Thus the problem described by Einstein and Wigner was supposed to apply to the whole universe. In this context, recent developments would only sharpen the formulation of the problem: If a typical universe is hostile to life as we know it, then we must be incredibly lucky to, by chance, live in the universe where life is possible and the universe comprehensible. This would indeed look like a miracle, like a ‚Äúgift which we neither understand nor deserve.‚Äù Can we do better than rely on the miraculous?</p><p>In the last thirty years, the way we think about the origin and the global structure of our world has changed profoundly. First of all, we found that inflation, the exponentially rapid expansion of the early universe, makes the universe flat and thus potentially suitable for life. Moreover, the rapid stretching of the universe makes the part where we live extremely homogeneous. Thus we have found an explanation for the observed uniformity of the universe. However, we have also found that on a very, very large scale (well beyond the present observable horizon of about 1010 light-years), the universe becomes 100 percent nonuniform, because of quantum effects amplified by the explosive expansion of space.</p><p>In the context of string theory in combination with inflationary cosmology, this means that instead of looking like an expanding symmetric sphere, our world looks more like a multiverse‚Äîan incredibly large collection of exponentially large bubbles. Each one of these bubbles looks like a universe, and now we use the word ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù to describe enormous, locally uniform parts of the world. One of the 10500 different laws of the low-energy physics originating from string theory operates inside each of these universes.</p><p>In some of these universes, quantum fluctuations are so large that any computations are impossible; mathematics there is inefficient, because predictions cannot be memorized and used. The lifetimes of some universes are too short. Other universes are long-lived but empty; their laws of physics do not allow the existence of any entities who could survive long enough to learn physics and mathematics.</p><p>Fortunately, among all possible parts of the multiverse, there should be some universes where life as we know it is possible. But our life is possible only if the laws of physics operating in our part of the multiverse allow formation of stable, long-lived structures capable of making computations. This implies existence of mathematical relations that can be used for the long-term predictions. The rapid development of the human race was possible only because we live in the part of the multiverse where the long-term predictions are so useful and efficient that they allow us to survive in the hostile environment and win in the competition with other species.</p><p>To summarize (and generalize), the inflationary multiverse consists of myriads of ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù with all possible laws of physics and mathematics operating in each. We can live only in those universes where the laws of physics allow our existence, which requires making reliable predictions. In other words, mathematicians and physicists can live only in those universes that are comprehensible and where the laws of mathematics are efficient.</p><p>You can dismiss everything I just wrote as wild speculation. It‚Äôs interesting, however, that in the context of the new cosmological paradigm developed in the last thirty years we might be able, for the first time, to approach one of the most complicated and mysterious questions that bothered two of the greatest scientists of the 20th century.</p><p>ALFV√âN‚ÄôS COSMOS</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_57.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_59.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
