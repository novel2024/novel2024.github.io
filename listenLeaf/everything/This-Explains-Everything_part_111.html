But the evidence has piled up. Growth rings in dinosaur bones show that they grew at a fast pace not achievable by reptiles. Their tracks showed that they walked at steady speeds too high for bradyaerobes. Many small dinosaurs were feathery. And polar dinosaurs, birds, and mammals were living through blizzardy Mesozoic winters that excluded ectotherms.</p><p>Because of the dinorevolution, our understanding of the evolution of the animals that dominated the continents is far closer to the truth than it was. Energy-efficient amphibians and reptiles dominated the continents for only 70 million years in the later portion of the Paleozoic, the era that had begun with trilobites and nothing on land. For the last 270 million years, higher-powered albeit less energy-efficient tachyenergy has reigned supreme on land, starting with protomammalian therapsids near the end of the Paleozoic. When therapsids went belly-up early in the Mesozoic (the survivors of the group being the then-all-small mammals), they were not replaced by lower-powered dinosaurs for the next 150 million years but by dinosaurs that quickly took aerobic-exercise capacity to even greater levels.</p><p>The unusual avian respiratory complex is so effective that some birds fly as high as airliners, but the system did not evolve for flight. That‚Äôs because the skeletal apparatus for operating air-sac-ventilated lungs first developed in flightless avepod dinosaurs for terrestrial purposes (some researchers, but by no means all, offer low global oxygen levels as the selective factor). So the basics of avian energetics appeared in predacious dinosaurs and only later were used to achieve powered flight. Rather like how internal combustion engines happened to make powered human flight practical, rather than having been developed to do so.</p><p>COMPLEXITY OUT OF SIMPLICITY</p><p>BRUCE HOOD</p><p>Director of the Bristol Cognitive Development Centre, University of Bristol, UK; author, The Self Illusion: How the Social Brain Creates Identity</p><p>As a scientist dealing with complex behavioral and cognitive processes, my deep and elegant explanation comes not from psychology (which is rarely elegant) but from the mathematics of physics. For my money, Fourier‚Äôs theorem has all the simplicity and yet more power than other familiar explanations in science. Stated simply, any complex pattern, whether in time or space, can be described as a series of overlapping sine waves of multiple frequencies and various amplitudes.</p><p>I first encountered Fourier‚Äôs theorem when I was a PhD student in Cambridge working on visual development. There I met Fergus Campbell, who in the 1960s had demonstrated that not only was Fourier‚Äôs theorem an elegant way of analyzing complex visual patterns, but it was also biologically plausible. This insight was later to become a cornerstone of various computational models of vision. But why restrict the analysis to vision?</p><p>In effect, any complex physical event can be reduced to the mathematical simplicity of sine waves. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is Van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night,‚Äù Mozart‚Äôs Requiem, Chanel‚Äôs No. 5, Rodin‚Äôs ‚ÄúThinker,‚Äù or a Waldorf salad. Any complex pattern in the environment can be translated into neural patterns that, in turn, can be decomposed into the multitude of sine-wave activity arising from the output of populations of neurons.</p><p>Maybe I have some physics envy, but to quote Lord Kelvin, ‚ÄúFourier‚Äôs theorem . . . is not only one of the most beautiful results of modern analysis but may be said to furnish an indispensable instrument in the treatment of nearly every recondite question in modern physics.‚Äù* You don‚Äôt get much higher praise than that.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_110.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_112.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
