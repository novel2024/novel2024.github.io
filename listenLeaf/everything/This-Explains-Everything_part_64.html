It may also be correct. If you must choose, choose correct. But it‚Äôs always better to have both.</p><p>‚ÄúElegant‚Äù is in the eye of the beholder. ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù is decided by the ultimate judge of science, Mother Nature, speaking through the results of experiments. Unlike the standard TV talent contests, neither ‚Äúelegant‚Äù nor ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù can be determined by a vote of the public or by a panel of sneering judges. But the feeling that an idea is elegant often depends on the question being asked.</p><p>All matter consists of six types of quarks and six types of leptons, with seemingly random unexplained mass values, spanning more than ten orders of magnitude. No one knows why, within these twelve building blocks, the same pattern repeats itself three times. Some of these objects may also convert into each other, under certain circumstances, by unexplained rates called ‚Äúmixing angles.‚Äù The twenty-odd values of these rates and masses seem to have been arbitrarily chosen by someone (Nature or God). This is what the Standard Model of Particle Physics tells us. Is this elegant? It does not seem so.</p><p>But the fact that mountains and snakes, oceans and garbage, people and computers, hamburgers and stars, diamonds and elephants, and everything else in the universe are all made of only a dozen types of fundamental objects is truly mind boggling. That is exactly what that same Standard Model says. So is it elegant? Very much so.</p><p>My great hope is that nature is actually even more elegant. The twelve fundamental quarks and leptons and their antiparticles all have electric charges 0, 1‚ÅÑ3, 2‚ÅÑ3, and 1 or the negative values of the same numbers. Each value repeats exactly three times.</p><p>There is no satisfactory explanation for many questions: Why are all charges multiples of 1‚ÅÑ3 of the electron charge? Why does each value between 0 and 1 appear on the list, and do so the same number of times? Why do they never acquire more than three doses of that quantity? Why does the same entire pattern repeat itself three times? Why do the leptons always have integer charges and the quarks non-integers? Why are quark charges and lepton charges at all related to each other by simple ratios?</p><p>The fact that mosquitoes, chairs, and tomato juice are all electrically neutral results from the unexplained equality of the magnitudes of the electric charges of protons and electrons, causing atoms to be neutral. This follows from the quark charges having precise simple ratios to the lepton charges. But why doesn‚Äôt the electron have a charge of, say, 0.8342 of that of the proton? Why do they have exactly the same charge value?</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_63.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_65.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
