I apologize for not following the instructions. But that‚Äôs the way of all good explanations. The better they are, the more questions they raise.</p><p>THE DARK MATTER OF THE MIND</p><p>JOEL GOLD</p><p>Psychiatrist; clinical associate professor of psychiatry, NYU School of Medicine</p><p>There are people who want a stable marriage yet continue to cheat on their wives.</p><p>There are people who want a successful career yet continue to undermine themselves at work.</p><p>Aristotle defined man as a rational animal. Contradictions like these show that we are not. All people live with the conflicts between what they want and how they live. For most of human history we had no way to explain this paradox, until Freud‚Äôs discovery of the unconscious resolved it. Before Freud, we were restricted to our conscious awareness when looking for answers regarding what we knew and felt. All we had to explain incompatible thoughts, feelings, and motivations was limited to what we could access in consciousness. We knew what we knew and we felt what we felt. Freud‚Äôs elegant explanation postulated a conceptual space, not manifest to us, where irrationality rules. This aspect of the mind is not subject to the constraints of rationality, such as logical inference, cause and effect, and linear time. The unconscious explains why presumably rational people live irrational lives.</p><p>Critics may take exception as to what Freud believed resides in the unconscious‚Äîdrives both sexual and aggressive, defenses, conflicts, fantasies, affects, and beliefs‚Äîbut no one would deny its existence; the unconscious is now a commonplace. How else to explain our stumbling through life, unsure of our motivations, inscrutable to ourselves? I wonder what a behaviorist believes is at play while he is in the midst of divorcing his third astigmatic redhead.</p><p>The universe consists primarily of dark matter. We can‚Äôt see it, but it has an enormous gravitational force. The conscious mind‚Äîmuch like the visible aspect of the universe‚Äîis only a small fraction of the mental world. The dark matter of the mind, the unconscious, has the greatest psychic gravity. Disregard the dark matter of the universe and anomalies appear. Ignore the dark matter of the mind and our irrationality is inexplicable.</p><p>‚ÄúTHERE ARE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH . . .
