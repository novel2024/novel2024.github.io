But in my view, the beautiful explanation is the one about unfettered thought-stuff.</p><p>CAGEPATTERNS</p><p>HANS-ULRICH OBRIST</p><p>Curator, Serpentine Gallery, London; author, Ai Weiwei Speaks; coauthor (with Rem Koolhaas), Project Japan: Metabolism Talks; editor, A Brief History of Curating</p><p>In art, the title of a work can often be its first explanation. And in this context I am thinking especially of the titles of Gerhard Richter. In 2006, when I visited Richter in his studio in Cologne, he had just finished a group of six corresponding abstract paintings to which he gave the title Cage.</p><p>There are many correlations between Richter‚Äôs paintings and the compositions of John Cage. In a book about the Cage series, Robert Storr has traced them from Richter‚Äôs attendance of a Cage performance at the Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in D√ºsseldorf in 1963 to analogies in their artistic processes. Cage has often applied chance procedures in his compositions, notably with the use of the I Ching. Richter, in his abstract paintings, also intentionally allows effects of chance. In these paintings, he applies the oil paint on the canvas with a large squeegee. He selects the colors on the squeegee, but the actual trace the paint leaves on the canvas is to a large extent the outcome of chance. The result then forms the basis for Richter‚Äôs decisions on how to continue with the next layer. In such an inclusion of ‚Äúcontrolled chance,‚Äù an artistic similarity between Cage and Richter can be found. In addition to the reference to John Cage, Richter‚Äôs title Cage also has a visual association, as the six paintings have a hermetic, almost impermeable appearance. The title points to different layers of meaning.</p><p>Beyond Richter‚Äôs abstract paintings, analogies to Cage can be found in other of his works. His book Patterns is my favorite book of 2011. It shows Richter‚Äôs experiment of taking an image of his Abstract Painting [CR: 724-4] and dividing it vertically into strips: first 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048, up to 4,096 strips. This methodology leads to 8,190 strips. Throughout the process, the strips become thinner and thinner. The experiment then leads to the strips being mirrored and repeated, which leads to a diversity of patterns. The outcomes are 221 patterns published on 246 double-page images. In Patterns, Richter set the precise rules, but he didn‚Äôt manipulate the outcome, so the pictures are again an interaction of a defined system and chance.</p><p>Patterns is one of many outstanding art books Richter has done over the last couple of years, such as Wald (2008), or Ice (1981), which includes a special layout of the artist with his stunning photos of a trip to the Antarctic. The layout of those books is composed of intervals with different arrangements of the photos but also blank spaces‚Äîlike pauses. Richter told me that his layout has to do with music, Cage, and silence.</p><p>In 2007, Richter designed a 20-meter-high arched stained-glass window to fill the south transept of Cologne Cathedral. The Cologne Cathedral Window comprises 11,000 hand-blown squares of glass in 72 colors derived from the palette of the original Medieval glazing that was destroyed during the Second World War. Half of the squares were allotted by a random generator, the other half were like a mirror image to them. Control is once more ceded here to some extent, suggesting his interest in Cage‚Äôs ideas to do with chance and the submission of the individual will to forces beyond one‚Äôs control. ‚ÄúCoincidences are only useful,‚Äù Richter has told me, ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôve been worked out‚Äîthat means either eliminated or allowed or emphasized.‚Äù</p><p>In Halberstadt, a performance of Cage‚Äôs piece ‚ÄúORGAN2/ASLSP‚Äù (1987) recently took place. ‚ÄúASLSP‚Äù stands for ‚Äúas slow as possible.‚Äù Cage has not further specified this instruction, so that each performance of the score will be different. The actual performance will take 639 years to be completed. The slowness in Cage‚Äôs piece is an essential aspect for our time. With globalization and the Internet, all processes have been accelerated to a speed in which no time for critical reflection remains. The present ‚ÄúSlow movement‚Äù thus advises us to take time for well-chosen decisions together with a more locally oriented approach. The idea of slowness is one of the many aspects that continue to make Cage most relevant for the 21st century.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_120.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_122.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
