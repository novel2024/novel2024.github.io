That is because the different minimal parental investment of men and women translates into differences in their ultimate evolutionary interests. Men, but not women, can multiply their reproductive output with multiple partners. Men are more prone than women to infidelity. Women are more vulnerable than men to desertion. Sex therefore takes place in the shadow of exploitation, illegitimacy, jealousy, spousal abuse, cuckoldry, desertion, harassment, and rape.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Love is not all you need, and does not make the world go round. Marriage does offer the couple the theoretical possibility of a perfect overlap of genetic interest, and hence an opportunity for the bliss we associate with romantic love, because their genetic fates are bound together in the same package‚Äînamely, their children. Unfortunately those interests can diverge because of infidelity, stepchildren, in-laws, or age differences‚Äîwhich are, not coincidentally, major sources of marital strife.</p><p>None of this implies that people are robots controlled by their genes, that complex traits are determined by single genes, that people may be morally excused for fighting, raping, or philandering, that people should try to have as many babies as possible, or that people are impervious to influences from their culture (to take some of the common misunderstandings of evolutionary explanations). What it does mean is that a large number of recurring forms of human conflict fall out of a small number of features of the process that made life possible.</p><p>THE FAURIE-RAYMOND HYPOTHESIS</p><p>JONATHAN GOTTSCHALL</p><p>Literary scholar; adjunct instructor, English Department, Washington & Jefferson College; author, The Storytelling Animal</p><p>I read about the Faurie-Raymond hypothesis a long time ago, but it didn‚Äôt click with me until I fought big Nick. Nick is a national guardsman who trains with me at the local mixed martial-arts academy. Technically we were just sparring, not fighting. But Nick is so strong, his punches so sincere, that even when he tries to throw gentle, he makes your consciousness wobble. The bell rang, and we engaged, and my fear passed quickly into disorientation. Something wasn‚Äôt right. Nick is powerful, but he‚Äôs not more skillful than I am and he‚Äôs not what you would call a graceful mover or a sophisticated striker. Nick plows forward: jab, cross; jab, cross, hook. Nick doesn‚Äôt bob. Nick doesn‚Äôt weave. Nick plows forward.</p><p>So why couldn‚Äôt I hit him? Why were my punches grazing harmlessly past his temples or glancing off his belly? And why, whenever I tried to slip and counter, was I eating glove leather? I tracked him through the blur of his hands, and all of the angles looked wrong, the planes of his face and body askew. There was nothing solid to hit. And all the while he was hammering me with punches I sensed too late‚Äîslow and heavy blows, maddeningly oblique.</p><p>When the bell finally saved me, we embraced (it‚Äôs a paradox; nothing makes men love each other as much as a good-natured fistfight). I collapsed in one of the folding chairs with my head throbbing and the sweat rolling down, and I said to myself, ‚ÄúThat seals it. Faurie-Raymond has to be true.‚Äù</p><p>Nick represents a type that 90 percent of boxers fear and despise on sight. Nick is a lefty, which is, according to my pugilism professor, ‚Äúan abomination‚Äù and ‚Äúa birth defect.‚Äù Here, my professor joins other righty authorities in the sweet science, who don‚Äôt seem to be kidding when they say, ‚ÄúAll southpaws should be drowned at birth.‚Äù</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_48.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_50.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
