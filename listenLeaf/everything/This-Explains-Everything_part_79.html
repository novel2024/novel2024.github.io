But getting to them involved venturing ‚Äúdownhill‚Äù into regions of lower fitness. I learned to distrust optimality.</p><p>Fitness landscapes (sometimes called ‚Äúadaptive landscapes‚Äù) keep turning up when people try to figure out how evolution or innovation works in a complex world. An important critique by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of early optimism about artificial intelligence warned that seemingly intelligent agents would dumbly ‚Äúhill climb‚Äù to local peaks of illusory optimality and get stuck there. Complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman used fitness landscapes to visualize his ideas about the ‚Äúadjacent possible‚Äù in 1993 and 2000, and that led in turn to Steven Johnson‚Äôs celebration of how the ‚Äúadjacent possible‚Äù works for innovation in Where Good Ideas Come From.</p><p>The man behind the genius of fitness landscapes was the founding theorist of population genetics, Sewall Wright (1889‚Äì1988). In 1932, he came up with the landscape as a way to visualize and explain how biological populations escape the potential trap of a local peak by imagining what might drive their evolutionary path downhill from the peak toward other possibilities. Consider these six diagrams of his:</p><p>¬© Sewall Wright, The Role of Mutation, Inbreeding, Crossbreeding, and Selection in Evolution, Sixth International Congress of Genetics, Brooklyn, NY: Brooklyn Botanical Garden, 1932.</p><p>The first two illustrate how low selection pressure or a high rate of mutation (which comes with small populations) can broaden the range of a species, whereas intense selection pressure or a low mutation rate can severely limit a species to the very peak of local fitness. The third diagram shows what happens when the landscape itself shifts, and the population has to evolve to shift with it.</p><p>The bottom row explores how small populations respond to inbreeding by wandering ineffectively. The best mode of exploration Wright deemed the final diagram, showing how a species can divide into an array of races that interact with one another. That jostling crowd explores well, and it can respond to opportunity.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_78.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_80.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
