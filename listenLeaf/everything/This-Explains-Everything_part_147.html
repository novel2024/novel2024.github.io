The deposits were much larger than the minimum predicted size. Moreover, uranium-235 has a half-life of 704 million years, decaying about six times faster than the U-238 atoms, so several half-lives ago (around about 2 billion years) there would have been much more U-235 in the deposits‚Äîenough to lead to a sustainable chain reaction. Extrapolating backward, the relative proportions of the two isotopes would have been approximately 97 to 3, rather than 99.3 to 0.7 as it is today. And finally, the layers of rock had originally been in contact with groundwater, suggesting that what happened was the following:</p><p>A chain reaction would start in rocks surrounded by water, and the uranium atoms would split and generate heat. The heat would turn the water to steam, destroying its ability to moderate the reaction, and the neutrons would escape, stopping the reaction. The steam would condense back into water and blanket the neutron emission. More neutrons would be retained, splitting the atoms and restarting the chain reaction.</p><p>Explaining a tiny anomaly in the ratio of two types of atom in a small piece of rock has led to a description of a series of events that happened in a specific location on Earth billions of years ago. Over a period of 150 million years, a natural nuclear reactor would produce heat for about half an hour and then shut down for two and a half hours before starting up again, producing an average power of 100 kilowatts, like that produced in a typical car engine. Not only is this explanation deep, elegant, and beautiful, it‚Äôs also incontrovertible. It doesn‚Äôt depend on opinion or bias or desires, unlike many other ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù of how the world works, and that‚Äôs the power of the best science.</p><p>KITTY GENOVESE AND GROUP APATHY</p><p>ADAM ALTER</p><p>Psychologist; assistant professor of marketing, Stern School of Business, New York University</p><p>The most elegant explanation in social psychology convinced me to pursue a PhD in the field. Every few years, a prominent tragedy attracts plenty of media attention because no one does anything to help. Just before sunrise on an April morning in 2010, a man lay dying on a sidewalk in Queens. The man, a homeless Guatemalan named Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax, had intervened to help a woman whose male companion had begun shouting and shaking her violently. When Tale-Yax intervened, the man stabbed him several times in the torso. For ninety minutes, Tale-Yax lay in a growing pool of his own blood as dozens of passersby ignored him or stared briefly before continuing on their way. By the time emergency medical workers arrived to help, the sun had risen, and Tale-Yax was dead.</p><p>Almost half a century earlier, another New Yorker, Kitty Genovese, was attacked and ultimately killed while dozens of onlookers apparently failed to intervene. A New York Times writer decried the callousness of New Yorkers, and experts claimed that life in the city had rendered its citizens soulless. As they would in response to Tale-Yax‚Äôs death, pundits wondered how dozens of people with functioning moral compasses could possibly have failed to help someone who was dying.</p><p>Social psychologists are taught to overcome the natural tendency to blame people for apparently bad behavior and to look instead for explanations in the environment. After Genovese‚Äôs death, social psychologists Bibb Latan√© and John M. Darley were convinced that something about the situation explained the bystanders‚Äô failure to intervene. Their elegant insight was that human responses aren‚Äôt additive in the same way that objects are additive. Whereas four lightbulbs illuminate a room more effectively than three lightbulbs, and three loudspeakers fill a room with noise more effectively than two loudspeakers, two people are often less effective than a single person. People second-guess situations, they stop to make sense of a chain of events before acting, and sometimes pride and the fear of looking foolish prevent them from acting at all.</p><p>In one of a series of brilliant studies, Latan√© and Darley videotaped students as they sat in a room that slowly filled with smoke.* The experimenters pumped smoke into the room with a smoke machine hidden behind a wall vent, the effect suggesting that there might be a fire nearby. When a subject was alone in the room, he usually left quickly and told the experimenter that something was amiss. But when a subject was surrounded by two or three others (some of them confederates, who were instructed to sit there immobile) he often remained seated, even as he lost sight of the others through the pall of smoke. When interviewed later, these students said they chose not to act because they concluded the smoke was benign (steam, or air-conditioning vapor), and they claimed that they had paid little or no attention to how the others in the room reacted.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_146.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_148.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
