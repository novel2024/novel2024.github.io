What might refract more blue light toward our eyes? In 1760, the mathematician Leonhard Euler speculated that the wave theory of light might help to explain why the sky is blue. The 19th century saw a flurry of experiments and observations of all sorts, from expeditions to mountaintops for observation to elaborate efforts to re-create the blue sky in a bottle‚Äîas chronicled in Peter Pesic‚Äôs wonderful book, Sky in a Bottle. Countless careful observations of blueness at different locations, altitudes, and times were made, including with bespoke devices known as cyanometers. Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure invented the first cyanometer in 1789. His version had fifty-three sections with varying shades of blue arranged in a circle. Saussure reasoned that something suspended in the air must be responsible for the blue color.</p><p>Indeed, for a very long time it had been suspected that something in the air modified the light and made it appear blue. Eventually it was realized that it was the air itself that did this‚Äîthat the gaseous molecules that compose the air are essential to making it appear blue. And so the blueness of the sky is connected to the discovery of the physical reality of atoms. The color of the sky is deeply connected to atomic theory, and even to Avogadro‚Äôs number. This in turn attracted Einstein‚Äôs attention in the period from 1905 to 1910.</p><p>So, the sky is blue because the incident light interacts with the gas molecules in the air in such a fashion that more of the light in the blue part of the spectrum is scattered, reaching our eyes on the surface of the planet. All the frequencies of the incident light can be scattered this way, but the high-frequency (short wavelength) blue is scattered more than the lower frequencies in a process known as Rayleigh scattering, described in the 1870s. John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, who received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1904 for the discovery of argon, demonstrated that when the wavelength of the light is on the same order as the size of the gas molecules, the intensity of scattered light varies inversely with the fourth power of its wavelength. Shorter wavelengths like blue (and violet) are scattered more than longer ones. It‚Äôs as if all the molecules in the air preferentially glowed blue, which is what we then see everywhere around us.</p><p>Yet the sky should appear violet, since violet light is scattered even more than blue light. The sky does not appear violet to us because of the final, biological part of the puzzle, which is the way our eyes are designed: They are more sensitive to blue than violet light.</p><p>The explanation for why the sky is blue involves much of the natural sciences: the colors in the visual spectrum, the wave nature of light, the angle at which sunlight hits the atmosphere, the mathematics of scattering, the size of nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and even the way human eyes perceive color. It‚Äôs most of science, in a question a young child can ask.</p><p>THE BEAUTY IN A SUNRISE</p><p>PHILIP CAMPBELL</p><p>Editor-in-chief, Nature</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_156.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_158.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
