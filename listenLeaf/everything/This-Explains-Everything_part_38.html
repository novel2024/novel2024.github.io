Most important, it rises above the question of cognitivism, the debate over whether there is any such thing as objective morality. Cognitivists assert that certain acts are inherently good or bad, regardless of the society in which they do or do not occur‚Äîvery much as the laws of physics are generally believed to be independent of those observing their effects. Noncognitivists claim, by contrast, that no moral position is universal and that each (hypothetical) society makes its own moral rules unfettered, so that even acts we would view as unequivocally immoral could be morally unobjectionable in some other culture. But when we make actual decisions concerning whether such-and-such a view is morally acceptable or not, reflective equilibrium frees us from the need to take a view on the cognitivism question. In a nutshell, it explains why we don‚Äôt need to know whether morality is objective.</p><p>I highlight monogamy here because, of the many topics to which reflective equilibrium can be usefully applied, Western society‚Äôs position on monogamy is at the most critical juncture. Monogamy today compares with heterosexuality not too many decades ago, or tolerance of slavery 150 years ago. Quite a lot of people depart from it, a much smaller minority actively advocate the acceptance of departure from it, but most people advocate it and disparage the minority view. Why is this the ‚Äúcritical juncture‚Äù? Because it is the point at which enlightened thought-leaders can make the greatest difference to the speed with which the transition to the morally inescapable position occurs.</p><p>First let me make clear that I refer here to sex and not (necessarily, anyway) to deeper emotional attachments. Whatever one‚Äôs views or predilections concerning the acceptability or desirability of having deep emotional attachments with more than one partner, fulfillment of the responsibilities they entail tends to take a significant proportion of the twenty-four hours of everyone‚Äôs day. The complications arising from this inconvenient truth are a topic for another time. In this essay, I focus on liaisons casual enough (whether or not repeated) that availability of time is not a major issue.</p><p>An argument from reflective equilibrium always begins with identification of the conventional views, with which one then makes a parallel. In this case, it‚Äôs all about jealousy and possessiveness. Consider chess, or drinking. These are rarely solitary pursuits. Now, is it generally considered reasonable for a friend with whom one sometimes plays chess to feel aggrieved when one plays chess with someone else? Indeed, if someone exhibited possessiveness in such a matter, would they not be viewed as unacceptably overbearing and egotistical?</p><p>My claim is probably obvious by now. It is simply that there is nothing about sex that morally distinguishes it from other activities performed by two (or more) people collectively. In a world no longer driven by reproductive efficiency, and presuming that all parties are taking appropriate precautions in relation to pregnancy and disease, sex is overwhelmingly a recreational activity. What, then, can morally distinguish it from other recreational activities? Once we see that nothing does, reflective equilibrium forces us to one of two positions: Either we start to resent the temerity of our regular chess opponents playing others, or we cease to resent the equivalent in sex.</p><p>My prediction that monogamy‚Äôs end is extremely nigh arises from my reference to reproductive efficiency above. Every single society in history has seen a precipitous reduction in fertility following its achievement of a level of prosperity that allowed reasonable levels of female education and emancipation. Monogamy is virtually mandated when a woman spends her entire adult life with young children underfoot, because continuous financial support cannot otherwise be ensured. But when it is customary for those of both sexes to be financially independent, this logic collapses. This is especially so for the increasing proportion of men and women who choose to delay having children until middle age (if then).</p><p>I realize that rapid change in a society‚Äôs moral compass needs more than the removal of influences maintaining the status quo; it also needs an active impetus. What is the impetus in this case? It is simply the pain and suffering that arises when the possessiveness and jealousy inherent in the monogamous mind-set butt heads with the asynchronous shifts of affection and aspiration inherent in the response of human beings to their evolving social interactions. Gratuitous suffering is anathema to all. Thus, the realization that this particular category of suffering is wholly gratuitous has not only irresistible moral force (via the principle of reflective equilibrium) but also immense emotional utility.</p><p>The writing is on the wall.</p><p>BOLTZMANN‚ÄôS EXPLANATION OF THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</p><p>LEONARD SUSSKIND</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_37.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_39.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
