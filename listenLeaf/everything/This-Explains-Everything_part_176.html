Aston Professor of Psychology, University of Virginia; author, Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change</p><p>People become what they do. This explanation of how people acquire attitudes and traits dates back to the late British philosopher Gilbert Ryle but was formalized by the social psychologist Daryl Bem in his self-perception theory. People draw inferences about who they are, Bem suggests, by observing their own behavior.</p><p>Self-perception theory turns common wisdom on its head. People act the way they do because of their personality traits and attitudes, right? They return a lost wallet because they‚Äôre honest, recycle their trash because they care about the environment, and pay $5 for a caramel brul√©e latte because they like expensive coffee drinks. It‚Äôs evident that behavior emanates from our inner dispositions, but Bem‚Äôs insight was to suggest that the reverse also holds. If we return a lost wallet, there‚Äôs an upward tick on our honesty meter. After we drag the recycling bin to the curb, we infer that we really care about the environment. And after purchasing the latte, we assume that we are coffee connoisseurs.</p><p>Hundreds of experiments have confirmed the theory and shown when this self-inference process is most likely to operate (for example, when people believe they freely chose to behave as they did and when they weren‚Äôt sure at the outset how they felt).</p><p>Self-perception theory is elegant in its simplicity. But it is also deep, with important implications for the nature of the human mind. Two other powerful ideas follow from it. The first is that we are strangers to ourselves. After all, if we knew our own minds, why would we need to guess what our preferences are from our behavior? If our minds were an open book, we would know exactly how honest we are and how much we like lattes. Instead, we often need to look to our behavior to figure out who we are. Self-perception theory thus anticipated the revolution in psychology in the study of human consciousness, a revolution that revealed the limits of introspection.</p><p>But it turns out that we don‚Äôt just use our behavior to reveal our dispositions‚Äîwe infer dispositions that weren‚Äôt there before. Often our behavior is shaped by subtle pressures around us, but we fail to recognize those pressures. Thus, we mistakenly believe that our behavior emanated from some inner disposition. Perhaps we aren‚Äôt particularly trustworthy and instead returned the wallet in order to impress the people around us. But, failing to realize that, we infer that we‚Äôre squeaky-clean honest. Maybe we recycle because the city has made it easy to do so (by giving us a bin and picking up every Tuesday) and our spouse and neighbors would disapprove if we didn‚Äôt. Instead of recognizing those reasons, though, we assume that we should be nominated for the Green Neighbor of the Month Award. Countless studies have shown that people are highly susceptible to social influence but rarely recognize the full extent of that susceptibility, thereby misattributing their compliance to their true desires.</p><p>Like all good psychological explanations, self-perception theory has practical uses. It is implicit in several versions of psychotherapy, in which clients are encouraged to change their behavior first, on the assumption that changes in their inner dispositions will follow. It has been used to prevent teenage pregnancies, by getting teens to do community service. The volunteer work triggers a change in their self-image, making them feel more a part of their community and less inclined to engage in risky behaviors. In short, we should all heed Kurt Vonnegut‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄúWe are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.‚Äù</p><p>PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES: THE IMPORTANCE OF CHANCE</p><p>SAMUEL BARONDES</p><p>Jeanne and Sanford Robertson Professor of Neurobiology and Psychiatry, University of California‚ÄìSan Francisco; author, Making Sense of People</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_175.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_177.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
