But when advance was possible, Ptolemy had made it impossible for advance to come through wishful thinking, witch doctors, or fantasy. His successors in the great age of modern astronomy had to play by his rules. They needed to observe more carefully, do their math with exacting care, and propose systems at the poise point of complexity and simplicity. Ptolemy challenged the moderns to outdo him‚Äîand so they could and did. We owe him a lot.</p><p>QUASI-ELEGANCE</p><p>PAUL STEINHARDT</p><p>Albert Einstein Professor in Science, Departments of Physics and Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University; coauthor (with Neil Turok), Endless Universe</p><p>My first exposure to true elegance in science was through a short semi-popular book entitled Symmetry, written by the renowned mathematician Hermann Weyl. I discovered the book in the fourth grade and have returned to reread passages every few years. The book begins with the intuitive aesthetic notion of symmetry for the general reader, drawing interesting examples from art, architecture, biological forms, and ornamental design. By the fourth and final chapter, though, Weyl turns from vagary to precise science as he introduces elements of group theory, the mathematics that transforms symmetry into a powerful tool.</p><p>To demonstrate its power, Weyl outlines how group theory can be used to explain the shapes of crystals. Crystals have fascinated humans throughout history because of the beautiful faceted shapes they form. Most rocks contain an amalgam of different minerals, each of which is crystalline but which have grown together or crunched together or weathered to the point that facets are unobservable. Occasionally, though, the same minerals form individual large faceted crystals; that‚Äôs when we find them most aesthetically appealing. ‚ÄúAluminum oxide‚Äù may not sound like something of value, but add a little chromium and give nature sufficient time, and you have a ruby worthy of kings.</p><p>The crystal facets found in nature meet only at certain angles corresponding to one of a small set of symmetries. But why does matter take some shapes and not others? What scientific information do the shapes convey? Weyl explains how these questions can be answered by seemingly unrelated abstract mathematics aimed at answering a different question: What shapes can be used to tessellate a plane or fill space if the shapes are identical, meet edge-to-edge, and leave no spaces?</p><p>Squares, rectangles, triangles, parallelograms, and hexagons can do the job. Perhaps you imagine that many other polygons would work as well‚Äîbut try and you will discover there are no more possibilities. Pentagons, heptagons, octagons, and all other regular polygons cannot fit together without leaving spaces. Weyl‚Äôs little book describes the mathematics allowing a full classification of possibilities; the final tally is only 17 in two dimensions (the so-called wallpaper patterns) and 230 in three dimensions.</p><p>The stunning fact about the list was that it precisely matched the list observed for crystals‚Äô shapes found in nature. The inference is that crystalline matter is like a tessellation made of indivisible, identical building blocks that repeat to make the entire solid. Of course, we know today that these building blocks are clusters of atoms or molecules. However, bear in mind that the connection between the mathematics and real crystals was made in the 19th century, when the atomic theory was still in doubt. It is amazing that an abstract study of tiles and building blocks can lead to a keen insight about the fundamental constituents of matter and a classification of all possible arrangements of them. It is a classic example of what physicist Eugene Wigner referred to as the ‚Äúunreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.‚Äù</p><p>The story does not end there. With the development of quantum mechanics, group theory and symmetry principles have been used to predict the electronic, magnetic, elastic, and other physical properties of solids. Emulating this triumph, physicists have successfully used symmetry principles to explain the fundamental constituents of nuclei and elementary particles, as well as the forces through which they interact.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_42.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_44.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
