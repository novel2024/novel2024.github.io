Indeed, many if not most species need to have an idea or trick that works well enough for them to continue to exist. Admittedly, they may not be able to extrapolate its principle from the context in which it emerged and generalize it, as (some) people can, courtesy of their prefrontal cortex.</p><p>When the finest minds fail to resolve a classical problem over decades or centuries of trying, they were probably trapped by a premise that was so culturally ‚Äúgiven‚Äù that it didn‚Äôt even occur to them to challenge it‚Äîor they didn‚Äôt notice it at all. But cultural context changes, and what seemed totally obvious yesterday becomes dubious, at best, today or tomorrow. Sooner or later, someone who may be no more gifted than his predecessors but is unshackled from some basic and incorrect assumption may hit upon the solution with relative ease.</p><p>Alternatively, one can be a fish, wait a million years or two, and see what comes up.</p><p>OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES</p><p>NICHOLAS A. CHRISTAKIS</p><p>Physician and social scientist, Harvard University; coauthor (with James Fowler), Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives</p><p>My favorite explanation is one that I sought as a boy. Why is the sky blue? It‚Äôs a question every toddler asks, but it‚Äôs also one that most great scientists since the time of Aristotle, including Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Ren√© Descartes, Leonhard Euler, and even Albert Einstein, have asked.</p><p>One of the things I like most about this explanation‚Äîbeyond the artless simplicity of the question itself‚Äîis how many centuries of effort it took to arrive at and how many branches of science it involves.</p><p>Unlike other everyday phenomena, such as the rising and setting sun, the color of the sky did not elicit much myth-making, even by the Greeks or the Chinese. There were few nonscientific explanations for its color. It took a while for the azure sky to be problematized, but, when it was, it kept our (scientific) attention. How could the atmosphere be colored, when the air we breathe is not?</p><p>Aristotle is the first, as far as we know, to ask why the sky is blue. His answer, in the treatise On Colors, is that the air close at hand is clear and the deep air of the sky is blue in the same way that a thin layer of water is clear but a deep well of water looks black. This idea was still being echoed in the 13th century, by Roger Bacon. Kepler, too, reinvented a similar explanation, arguing that the air merely looks colorless because the tint of its color is so faint when in a thin layer. But none of them offered an explanation for the blueness of the atmosphere.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_155.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_157.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
