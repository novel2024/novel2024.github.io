Is there some reason the top ranks do so overly well and the bottom ranks seem so unfairly penalized? The short answer is no, there‚Äôs no real reason. There need be no conspiracy to skew the rewards. Galling as it seems, inverse-power-law distributions are a fundamental natural law about the behavior of systems. They‚Äôre ubiquitous.</p><p>Inverse power laws aren‚Äôt limited to societies‚Äîthey also dominate the statistics of the natural world. The tenth smallest lake is likely to be a tenth as large as the biggest one, the hundredth largest tree in a forest may be a hundredth as big as the largest tree, the thousandth largest stone on a beach is a thousandth the size of the largest one.</p><p>Whether or not we like them, inverse power laws are as inevitable as turbulence, entropy, or the law of gravity. This said, we can somewhat moderate them in our social context, and it would be too despairing to say we have no control whatsoever over the disparities between our rich and our poor.</p><p>But the basic structures of inverse-power-law curves will never go away. We can rail at an inverse power law if we like‚Äîor we can accept it, perhaps hoping to bend the harsh law toward not so steep a swoop.</p><p>HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS</p><p>SAMUEL ARBESMAN</p><p>Applied mathematician; senior scholar, Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</p><p>In one of his celebrated just-so stories, Rudyard Kipling recounted how the leopard got his spots. Taking this approach to its logical conclusion, we would need distinct stories for every animal‚Äôs pattern: the leopard‚Äôs spots, the cow‚Äôs splotches, the panther‚Äôs solid color. And we would have to add even more stories for the complex patterning of everything from molluscs to tropical fish.</p><p>But far from these different animals requiring separate and distinct explanations, there is a single underlying explanation that shows how we can get all of these different patterns using a single unified theory.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_183.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_185.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
