Perhaps the most lyrical thinker to address this question is Frederick Brooks, author of The Mythical Man-Month. (If one notes that this unfortunately titled book was first published in 1975, it‚Äôs easier to ignore the sexist language littering it; the points Brooks made thirty-seven years ago are almost all accurate today, except the assumption that all programmers are ‚Äúhe.‚Äù)</p><p>Espousing the joys of programming, Brooks writes:</p><p>The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. . . . Yet the program construct, unlike the poet‚Äôs words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.</p><p>But this magic comes with the bite of its flip side:</p><p>In many creative activities the medium of execution is intractable. Lumber splits; paints smear; electrical circuits ring. These physical limitations of the medium constrain the ideas that may be expressed, and they also create unexpected difficulties in the implementation.</p><p>. . . Computer programming, however, creates with an exceedingly tractable medium. The programmer builds from pure thought-stuff: concepts and very flexible representations thereof. Because the medium is tractable, we expect few difficulties in implementation; hence our pervasive optimism. Because our ideas are faulty, we have bugs; hence our optimism is unjustified.</p><p>Just as there is an arbitrarily large number of ways to arrange the words in an essay, a staggering variety of different programs can be written to perform the same function. The universe of possibility is too wide open, too unconstrained, to permit elimination of errors.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_119.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_121.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
