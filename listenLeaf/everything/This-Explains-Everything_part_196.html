Instead of divining truth through the authority of an ancient holy book or philosophical treatise, people began to explore the book of nature for themselves.</p><p>Instead of looking at illustrations in illuminated botanical books, scholars went out into nature to see what was actually growing out of the ground.</p><p>Instead of relying on the woodcuts of dissected bodies in old medical texts, physicians opened bodies themselves to see with their own eyes what was there.</p><p>Instead of burning witches after considering the spectral evidence as outlined in the Malleus Maleficarum‚Äîthe authoritative book of witch-hunting‚Äîjurists began to consider other forms of more reliable evidence before convicting someone of a crime.</p><p>Instead of a tiny handful of elites holding most of the political power by keeping their citizens illiterate, uneducated, and unenlightened, people could see for themselves, through science, literacy, and education, the power and corruption that held them down, and they began to throw off their chains of bondage and demand rights.</p><p>Instead of the divine right of kings, people demanded the natural right of democracy. Democratic elections, in this sense, are scientific experiments: Every couple of years, you carefully alter the variables with an election and observe the results. Many of our founding fathers were scientists who deliberately adapted the method of data-gathering, hypothesis-testing, and theory formation to their nation-building. Their understanding of the provisional nature of findings led them to form a social system wherein empiricism was the centerpiece of a functional polity. The new government was like a scientific laboratory, conducting a series of experiments year by year, state by state. The point was not to promote this or that political system but to set up a system whereby people could experiment to see what works. That is the principle of empiricism applied to the social world.</p><p>As Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Tyler in 1804: ‚ÄúNo experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying, and which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be governed by reason and truth.‚Äù</p><p>WE ARE STARDUST</p><p>KEVIN KELLY</p><p>Editor-at-large, Wired; author, What Technology Wants</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_195.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_197.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
