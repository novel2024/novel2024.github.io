Elegance is formal beauty. And formal beauty as a philosophical principle is one of the most dangerous, subversive ideas humanity has discovered: It is the virtue of theoretical simplicity. Its destructive force is greater than Darwin‚Äôs algorithm or that of any other single scientific explanation, because it shows us what the depth of an explanation is.</p><p>Elegance as theoretical simplicity comes in many different forms. Everybody knows Occam‚Äôs razor, the ontological principle of parsimony: Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity. William of Occam gave us a metaphysical principle for choosing between competing theories. All other things being equal, it is rational to prefer the theory that makes fewer ontological assumptions.</p><p>We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances‚ÄîIsaac Newton formulated this as the First Rule of Reasoning in Philosophy, in his Principia Mathematica. Throw out everything that is explanatorily idle, and then shift the burden of proof to the proponent of a less simple theory. In Albert Einstein‚Äôs words: The grand aim of all science . . . is to cover the greatest possible number of empirical facts by logical deductions from the smallest possible number of hypotheses or axioms.</p><p>Of course, in today‚Äôs technical debates new questions have emerged: Why do metaphysics at all? Isn‚Äôt what we should measure simply the number of free, adjustable parameters in competing hypotheses? Isn‚Äôt it syntactic simplicity that captures elegance best in, say, the number-fundamental abstractions and guiding principles a theory makes use of? Or will the true criterion of elegance ultimately be found in statistics‚Äîin selecting the best model for a set of data points while optimally balancing parsimony with the ‚Äúgoodness of fit‚Äù of a suitable curve? And, of course, for Occam-style ontological simplicity, the big question remains: Why should a parsimonious theory more likely be true? Ultimately, isn‚Äôt all of this rooted in a deeply hidden belief that God must have created a beautiful universe?</p><p>I find it fascinating to see how the idea of simplicity has kept its force over the centuries. As a metatheoretical principle, it has demonstrated great power‚Äîthe subversive power of reason and reductive explanation. The formal beauty of theoretical simplicity is deadly and creative at the same time. It destroys superfluous assumptions whose falsity we just cannot bring ourselves to believe, whereas truly elegant explanations always give birth to an entirely new way of looking at the world. What I would really like to know is this: Can the fundamental insight‚Äîthe destructive, creative virtue of simplicity‚Äîbe transposed from the realm of scientific explanation into culture or onto the level of conscious experience? What kind of formal simplicity would make our culture a deeper, more beautiful culture? And what is an elegant mind?</p><p>EINSTEIN EXPLAINS WHY GRAVITY IS UNIVERSAL</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_45.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_47.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
