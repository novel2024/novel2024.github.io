With only three basic particles, one could explain the properties of 118 atoms/elements and the properties of thousands upon thousands of compounds chemically combined from those elements. A rather amazing feat, and certainly making the Rutherford-Bohr model worthy of being considered a ‚Äúfavorite deep, elegant, and beautiful explanation.‚Äù</p><p>Since that great simplification, further developments in our understanding of the physical universe have gotten more complicated, not less. To explain the properties of our three basic particles of matter, we went looking for even-more-basic particles. We ended up needing twelve fermions (six quarks, six leptons) to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù the properties of the three previously thought-to-be basic particles (as well as the properties of some other particles that were not known to us until we built high-energy colliders). And we added four other particles, force-carrier particles, to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù the four fundamental force fields (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong nuclear interaction, and weak nuclear interaction) that affect those three previously thought-to-be basic particles. Of these sixteen now thought-to-be basic particles, most are not independently observable (at least at low energies).</p><p>Even if the present Standard Model of Particle Physics turns out to be true, the question can be asked: ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù Every particle, whatever its level in the hierarchy, will have certain properties or characteristics. When we are asked why quarks have a particular electric charge, color charge, spin, or mass, do we simply say, ‚ÄúThey just do‚Äù? Or do we try to find even-more-basic particles that seem to explain the properties of quarks, leptons, and bosons? And if so, does this continue to still-even-more-basic particles? Could it go on forever? Or at some point, when asked, ‚ÄúWhy does this particle have these properties?,‚Äù would we simply say, ‚ÄúIt just does‚Äù? At some point, would we have to say that there is no ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to the universe? It just is.</p><p>At what level of our hierarchy of understanding would we resort to saying, ‚ÄúIt just is‚Äù? The first level (with the least amount of understanding about the world) is religious: the gods of Mount Olympus, each responsible for some worldly phenomenon, or the all-knowing monotheistic god creating the world and making everything work by means truly unknowable to humans. In their theories about how the world worked, Aristotle and other Greek philosophers incorporated the Olympian gods (earth, water, fire, and air were all assigned to particular gods), but Democritus and other philosophers were deterministic and materialistic, and they looked for predictable patterns and simple building blocks that might create the complex world they saw around them. In the evolution of scientific thinking, there have been various ‚ÄúIt just is‚Äù moments, when an explanation or theory seems to hit a wall, until someone comes along and says, ‚ÄúMaybe not‚Äù and goes on to advance our understanding. But as we get to the most basic questions about our universe (and our existence), the ‚ÄúIt just is‚Äù answer becomes more likely. One basic scientific question is whether truly indivisible particles of nature will ever be found. The accompanying philosophical question is whether there can be truly indivisible particles of nature.</p><p>At some level, the next group of mathematically derived ‚Äúparticles‚Äù may so obviously appear not to be observable/‚Äúreal‚Äù that we will describe them instead as simply entities in a mathematical model that seems to accurately describe the properties of the observable particles in the level above. At which point, the answer to the question of why these particles act as described by this mathematical model would be ‚ÄúThey just do.‚Äù How far down we go with such models will probably depend on how much a new level in the model allows us to explain previously unexplainable observed phenomena or correctly predict new phenomena. (Or perhaps we might be stopped by the model‚Äôs becoming too complex.)</p><p>For determinists still unsettled by the probabilities inherent in quantum mechanics or the philosophical question about what would have come before a Big Bang, it‚Äôs just one more step toward recognizing the true unsolvable mystery of our universe‚Äîrecognizing it, but maybe still not accepting it. A new and much better model could still come along.</p><p>SUBVERTING BIOLOGY</p><p>PATRICK BATESON</p><p>Professor of ethology, Cambridge University; coauthor (with Paul Martin), Design for a Life</p><p>Two years ago, I reviewed the evidence on inbreeding in pedigreed dogs. Inbreeding can result in reduced fertility both in litter size and sperm viability, developmental disruption, lower birth rate, higher infant mortality, shorter life span, increased expression of inherited disorders, and reduced immune-system function. The immune system is closely linked to the removal of cancer cells from a healthy body, and, indeed, reduced immune-system function increased the risk of full-blown tumors. These well-documented cases in domestic dogs confirm what is known from many wild populations of other species. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that a variety of mechanisms render inbreeding less likely in the natural world. One such is the choice of unfamiliar individuals as sexual partners.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_138.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_140.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
