Like furry rubber bands and electric fields, these relationships represent analogies between governing equations. Unlike words, they can be exact, providing explanations that connect unfamiliar formalism with familiar experience.</p><p>THE PRINCIPLE OF INERTIA</p><p>LEE SMOLIN</p><p>Physicist, Perimeter Institute; author, The Trouble with Physics, The Life of the Cosmos, and Three Roads to Quantum Gravity</p><p>My favorite explanation in science is the principle of inertia. It explains why we can‚Äôt feel the Earth in motion. This principle was perhaps the most counterintuitive and revolutionary step taken in all of science. It was proposed by both Galileo and Descartes and has been the core of countless successful explanations in physics in the centuries since. The principle is the answer to a very simple question: How would an object that is free (in the sense that no external influences or force affects its motion) move?</p><p>To answer this question, we need a definition of motion. What does it mean for something to move? The modern conception is that motion has to be described relative to an observer.</p><p>Consider an object at rest relative to you‚Äîsay, a cat sleeping on your lap‚Äîand imagine how it appears to move as seen by other observers. Depending on how the observer is moving, the cat can appear to have any sort of motion at all. If the observer spins relative to you, the cat will appear to spin to that observer. So to make sense of the question of how free objects move, we have to refer to a special class of observers. The answer to the question is the following:</p><p>There is a special class of observers, relative to whom all free objects appear either to be at rest or to move in a straight line at a constant speed.</p><p>I have just stated the principle of inertia.</p><p>The power of this principle is that it is completely general. Once a special observer sees a free object move in a straight line with constant speed, she will observe all other free objects to so move.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_168.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_170.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
