Instead of focusing on pedantic philosophical issues, Crick and Koch began with their naive intuitions. “Consciousness” has many attributes—continuity in time; a sense of agency or free will; recursiveness, or “self-awareness,” etc. But one attribute that stands out is subjective unity: You experience all your diverse sense impressions, thoughts, willed actions, and memories as a unity—not as jittery or fragmented. This attribute of consciousness, with the accompanying sense of the immediate present, or the “here and now,” is so obvious that we don’t usually think about it; we regard it as axiomatic.</p><p>So a central feature of consciousness is its unity—and here is a brain structure that sends and receives signals to and from practically all other brain structures, including the right parietal (involved in polysensory convergence and embodiment) and the anterior cingulate (involved in the experience of “free will”). Thus the claustrum seems to unify everything anatomically, and consciousness does so mentally. Crick and Koch recognized that this might not be a coincidence: The claustrum may be central to consciousness—indeed, it may embody the idea of the Cartesian theater, taboo among philosophers—or at least be the conductor of the orchestra. It is this kind of childlike reasoning that often leads to great discoveries. Obviously, such analogies don’t replace rigorous science, but they’re a good place to start. Crick and Koch’s idea may be right or wrong, but it’s elegant. If it’s right, they have paved the way to solving one of the great mysteries of biology. Even if it’s wrong, students entering the field would do well to emulate their style. Crick was right too often to ignore.</p><p>I visited him at his home in La Jolla in July of 2004. He saw me to the door as I was leaving and, as we parted, gave me a sly, conspiratorial wink: “I think it’s the claustrum, Rama. That’s where the secret is.” A week later, he passed away.</p><p>OVERLAPPING SOLUTIONS</p><p>DAVID M. EAGLEMAN</p><p>Neuroscientist, Baylor College of Medicine; author, Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain</p><p>The elegance of the brain lies in its inelegance. For centuries, neuroscience attempted to neatly assign labels to the various parts of the brain: This is the area for language, this for morality, this for tool use, color detection, face recognition, and so on. The search for an orderly brain map started off as a viable endeavor but turned out to be misguided.</p><p>The deep and beautiful trick of the brain is more interesting: It possesses multiple, overlapping ways of dealing with the world. It is a machine built of conflicting parts. It is a representative democracy that functions by competition among parties who all believe they know the right way to solve the problem.</p><p>As a result, we can get mad at ourselves, argue with ourselves, curse at ourselves, and contract with ourselves. We can feel conflicted. These sorts of neural battles lie behind marital infidelity, relapses into addiction, cheating on diets, breaking of New Year’s resolutions—all situations in which some parts of a person want one thing and other parts another.</p><p>These are things that modern machines simply do not do. Your car cannot be conflicted about which way to turn: It has one steering wheel commanded by one driver, and it follows directions without complaint. Brains, on the other hand, can be of two minds, and often many more. We don’t know whether to turn toward the cake or away from it, because there are several sets of hands on the steering wheel of behavior.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_66.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_68.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
