One of the most compelling examples is the pigeonhole principle.</p><p>Here’s what the pigeonhole principle says. Suppose a flock of pigeons lands in a group of trees and there are more pigeons than trees. Then after all the pigeons have landed, at least one of the trees contains more than one pigeon.</p><p>This fact sounds obvious, and it is: There are simply too many pigeons, so they can’t each get their own tree. Indeed, if this were the end of the story, it wouldn’t be clear why this is a fact that deserves to be named or noted. But to appreciate the pigeonhole principle, you have to see some of the things you can do with it.</p><p>So let’s move on to a fact that doesn’t look nearly as straightforward. The statement itself is intriguing, but what’s more intriguing is the effortless way it will follow from the pigeonhole principle. Here’s the fact: Sometime in the past 4,000 years there have been two people in your family tree—call them A and B—with the property that A was an ancestor of B’s mother and also an ancestor of B’s father. Your family tree has a loop, where two branches growing upward from B come back together at A—in other words, there’s a set of parents in your ancestry who are blood relatives of each other, thanks to this relatively recent shared ancestor A.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning a couple of things here. First, the “you” in the previous paragraph is genuinely you, the reader. Indeed, one of the interesting features of this fact is that I can make such assertions about you and your ancestors despite not even knowing who you are. Second, the statement doesn’t rely on any assumptions about the evolution of the human race or the geographic sweep of human history. Here, in particular, are the only assumptions I’ll need:</p><p>Everyone has two biological parents.</p><p>No one has children after the age of a hundred.</p><p>The human race is at least 4,000 years old.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_117.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_119.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
