Where is its seed of destruction? Amazingly, it‚Äôs not obvious that there is one. The very name of the great quest of theoretical physics‚Äîquantizing general relativity‚Äîbetrays an expectation that quantum theory will remain untouched by the unification we seek. String theory‚Äîin my view, by far the most successful, if incomplete, result of this quest‚Äîis strictly quantum mechanical, with no modifications whatsoever to the framework that was completed by Heisenberg, Schr√∂dinger, and Dirac. In fact, the mathematical rigidity of quantum mechanics makes it difficult to conceive of any modifications, whether or not they are called for by observation.</p><p>Yet there are subtle hints that quantum mechanics, too, will suffer the fate of its predecessors. The most intriguing, in my mind, is the role of time. In quantum mechanics, time is an essential evolution parameter. But in general relativity, time is just one aspect of spacetime, a concept that we know breaks down at the singularity deep inside a black hole. Where time no longer makes sense, it is hard to see how quantum mechanics could still reign. As quantum mechanics surely spells trouble for general relativity, the existence of singularities suggests that general relativity may also spell trouble for quantum mechanics. It will be fascinating to watch this battle play out.</p><p>EINSTEIN‚ÄôS REVENGE: THE NEW GEOMETRIC QUANTUM</p><p>ERIC R. WEINSTEIN</p><p>Mathematician and economist; principal, Natron Group</p><p>The modern theory of the quantum has only recently come to be understood to be far more exquisitely geometric than Einstein‚Äôs general relativity. How this came to be discovered over the last forty years is a fascinating story that has, to the best of my knowledge, never been fully told, as it is not particularly popular with the people who created this stunning achievement.</p><p>The story begins at some point around 1973‚Äì74, when our consensus picture of fundamental particle theory stopped advancing. This stasis, known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, seemed initially little more than a temporary resting place on the relentless path toward progress in fundamental physics, and theorists wasted no time proposing new theories in the expectation that they would be quickly confirmed by experimentalists looking for novel phenomena. But that expected entry into the promised land of new physics turned into a forty-year period of half-mad tribal wandering in an arid desert, all but devoid of new phenomena.</p><p>Yet just as particle theory was failing to advance in the mid-1970s, something amazing was quietly happening over lunch at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. There, Nobel physics laureate C. N. Yang and geometer (and soon to be billionaire) Jim Simons had started an informal seminar to understand what, if anything, modern geometry had to do with quantum field theory. Their shocking discovery was that both geometers and quantum theorists had independently got hold of different collections of insights into a common structure that each group had discovered for themselves. A Rosetta stone of sorts called the Wu-Yang dictionary was quickly assembled by the physicists, and Isadore Singer of MIT took these results from Stony Brook to his collaborator Michael Atiyah in Oxford, where their research with Nigel Hitchin began a geometric renaissance in physics-inspired geometry that continues to this day.</p><p>While the Stony Brook story is less discussed by today‚Äôs younger mathematicians and physicists, it is not a point of contention between the various members of the community. The controversial part of this story, however, is that a hoped-for golden era of theoretical physics did not materialize or produce a new consensus theory of elementary particles. Instead the interaction highlighted the strange idea that, just possibly, quantum theory was actually a natural and elegant body of pure geometry that had fallen into an abysmal state of dilapidation putting it beyond mathematical recognition. By this reasoning, the mathematical train wreck of modern quantum field theory was able to cling to life by its fingernails and survive numerous near-death experiences, confronting mathematical rigor only because it was being held together by a natural infinite-dimensional geometry which is, to this day, only partially understood.</p><p>In short, most physicists were trying and failing to quantize Einstein‚Äôs geometric theory of gravity because they were first meant to go in the opposite and less glamorous direction of geometrizing the quantum instead. Unfortunately for physics, mathematicians had dropped the ball and not sufficiently developed the geometry of infinite-dimensional systems (such as the Standard Model), which would have been analogous to the four-dimensional Riemannian geometry appropriated from mathematics by Einstein.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_87.html">‚¨ÖÔ∏è</a> | <a href="index.html">üìÑ</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_89.html">‚û°Ô∏è</a></div></body></html>
