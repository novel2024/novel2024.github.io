They are more like Darwin’s “tangled bank,” with its “elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner.”* Lovely. But can an ecological metaphor replace the metaphor of body as machine? Not likely. Perhaps someday understanding how natural selection shapes organic complexity will be so widely and deeply understood that scientists will be able to say, “A body is like . . . a living body,” and everyone will know exactly what that means.</p><p>HOW TO HAVE A GOOD IDEA</p><p>MARCEL KINSBOURNE</p><p>Professor of psychology, The New School; coauthor (with Paula J. Kaplan), Children’s Learning and Attention Problems</p><p>You don’t have to be human to have a good idea. You can even be a fish.</p><p>There’s a large fish in shallow Micronesian waters that feeds on little fishes. The little fishes dwell in holes in the mud but swarm out to feed. The big fish starts to gobble up the little fishes, one by one, but they immediately retreat back into their holes when his meal has barely begun. What to do?</p><p>I have put this problem to my classes over the years, and I remember only one student who came up with the big fish’s Good Idea. Of course he did it after a little thought, not after millions of years of evolution, but who’s counting?</p><p>Here’s the elegant trick. When the school of little fish appears, instead of gobbling, he swims low so that his belly rubs over the mud and blocks the escape holes. Then he can dine at leisure.</p><p>What do we learn? To have a good idea, stop having a bad one. The trick was to inhibit the easy, obvious, but ineffective attempts, permitting a better solution to come to mind. That worked for the big fish by some mechanism of mutation and natural selection in fish antiquity. Instead of tinkering with the obvious—obsessing about eating faster, taking bigger bites, etc.—junk plan A, and plan B comes swimming up. For humans, if the second solution doesn’t work either, block that too, and wait. A third floats into awareness, and so on, until the insoluble is solved, even if the most intuitively obvious premises have to be overridden in the process.</p><p>To the novice, the Good Idea seems magical, a leap of intellectual lightning. More likely, however, it resulted from an iterative process as outlined above, with enough experience to help reject seductive but misleading premises. Thus the extraordinary actually arises, step by step, out of the ordinary.</p></div><div class='nav'><a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_154.html">⬅️</a> | <a href="index.html">📄</a> | <a href="This-Explains-Everything_part_156.html">➡️</a></div></body></html>
