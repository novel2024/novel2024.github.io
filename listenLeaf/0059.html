    <p> Any industry that operates on a franchising or similar model (the Post Office) and any industry that has seen outsourcing is an example of this. If a supplier fails, other suppliers are found within the time it takes to run out of inventory. Similarly, a new job is found before the emergency fund is depleted. However, since the strategy is preset by society (see The lock-in), improvements are limited to tactics such as introducing more slack through reserve funds, using the proper amount of savings and insurance, and simply running the operation faster--hence the fascination with lifehacking, productivity, time-saving strategies, and the almost fanatical discussions of exactly how large the emergency fund should be and how much one should spend on each budget category.</p>
    
    <p>
Now, knowing the difference between the categories is one thing, but if you have ever been involved in a start-up or gone through any other kind of transformation, you'll know that the underlying thinking and feeling of the finished stage can be very different from the thinking and feeling in the intermediate stage, which again is different from the initial stage, exactly because it's a complex, nonlinear process. Therefore, we'll now look at principles for creating the initial stage of consilience and resilience in a life strategy.
A modular design Consider the cash flow of a salary man who puts effort into a job that yields a wage, which is then spent on stuff that is used or consumed in an endless cycle. This figure shows how the dependencies look in greater detail and in extreme conditions this can be a literal depiction, where the boxes are buildings and the arrows correspond to driving a car between the boxes.</p>
    
    <p> There's a box for the home, a box for the job, where the consumer drives to get money, and boxes for stores, where he drives to exchange the money from his job for entertainment or stuff which he drives back to his home.
Consumer culture shows a modular structure where problems are solved by driving to different stores to buy parts of the solution. This activity is made possible by driving to a job and exchanging time for money.
This figure shows a tight coupling between the consumer, the job, and the stores, respectively.</p>
    
    <p> Here the stores should be thought of broadly as shops, gyms, restaurants, dentists, plumbers, etc. If the coupling to the job is severed, the advanced consumer with good credit, savings, or insurance can draw on those, but he still needs to go to stores for his needs, since everything requires external interaction in the form of regular trips to stores--"I'm going to the store, need anything?" This is the consequence of specialization. The solutions to his problems,
except the very specialized problem detailed in his job description, have been outsourced to the marketplace and personal competence has been lost or replaced with information on "where to find good deals." Eventually he comes to depend strongly on this marketplace and hence on his continued employment.</p>
    
    <p>
The individual consumers depend as strongly on an aggregate of stores as the stores depend on the aggregate of consumers. This explains advertising and the insistence for expert solutions, at least as far as the experts are concerned, for they need to earn money at their jobsÂ too.
This is outsourcing taken to its logical extreme. Many believe that extreme outsourcing such as hiring assistants to write personal letters, walk their dog, and maybe talk to their spouses, is the way to go, counting on lower offshore living costs to maintain their comparative advantage, or even common outsourcing such as buying cake mixes, eating out, or having a plumber fix a clogged pipe.</p>
    
    <p> There are three reasons for this line of thinking.
The first is misinformation. Consumers have become convinced that experts are needed for anything but the simplest task. The second is lack of personal skills.</p>
    
    <p> Knowing how to provide basic needs, like householding skills or how to stay happy, can be tremendously valuable. They can often be had very inexpensively compared to what the market offers. For instance, imagine the value of a support network of family and friends, or meaningful, unstressful work, compared to the hourly rate of a psychotherapist or stress-relieving prescription drugs. Or that preprocessed food, which only needs to be heated, takes about 15 minutes of salary work to pay for, which is comparable to the time it takes to cook a similar meal from scratch.</p>
    
    <p> The third is lack of choices. When the market mainly offers full-time jobs and the culture expects you to spend the rest of your time shopping and watching TV, it leaves little time for anything else.
For individuals, outsourcing and comparative advantage can't remain advantageous in practice if taken to extremes. Yet in many ways it has been taken too far already when people spend eight hours a day for 30 years to buy electric can openers and marble towers.</p>
