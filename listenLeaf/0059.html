    <p> Walls became necessary as a way of relieving the mental strain that comes along with closely packed populations of unfamiliar others. For most of human history, after all, people lived with their family members in one-room dwellings. Everyone they knew lived not far from their front door, and it was useful to keep track of others’ comings and goings. Even medieval kings and queens lived in a single large hall, filled with their chosen attendants and counselors.</p>
    
    <p> But with the emergence of cities and their crowds of unacquainted people, urban residents began to seek out spaces in which to read, think, and write—alone.
“The wall was designed to protect us from the cognitive load of having to keep track of the activities of strangers,” observes Colin Ellard, an environmental psychologist and neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada. “This became increasingly important as we moved from tiny agrarian settlements to larger villages and, eventually, to cities—where it was too difficult to keep track of who was doing what to whom.” The privacy afforded by walls represented a truly revolutionary extension of the mind, maintains John Locke, professor of linguistics at Lehman College of the City University of New York.</p>
    
    <p> “Our distant ancestors could see each other at all times, which kept them safe but also imposed a huge cognitive cost,” he notes. “When residential walls were erected, they eliminated the need to look around every few seconds to see what others were doing.” The result, he says, was that “a human vigil, one beginning with ancestors that we share with apes, was reduced to manageable proportions, freeing up many hours of undistracted time per day.” An early example of such walls can be found amid the hubbub of today’s Manhattan, tucked away inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
    
    <p> There, among the Grecian urns and the colonial-era silver, is a tiny gem of a room, re-created as it was in fifteenth-century Perugia: the studiolo of Federico da Montefeltro,
Duke of Urbino. Federico, whose title called on him to be variously a royal, a politician, and a warrior, lived in the town of Gubbio in what is now central Italy. The walls of the study allowed the duke, a lover of literature, architecture,
and mathematics, to retreat from the company of the townspeople he ruled into quiet study and contemplation. And because his studiolo was constructed in Renaissance Italy, these were no ordinary walls.</p>
    
    <p> Craftsmen from Siena,
Florence, and Naples created elaborate trompe l’oeil murals made entirely of inlaid wood, a technique called intarsia.
In slivers of rosewood, oak, and beech, these designs depict in precise detail (and in linear perspective, a then newly invented technique) simulated cabinets full of precious objects—each one a symbol of what the duke most admired and to which he most aspired. A lute and a harp showed he was a man of culture; a mace and a pair of spurs represented his skill in battle; a bound volume of Virgil’s Aeneid was a sign of his erudition. Incorporated into every corner of the space were mottos and motifs that represented the duke’s personal, familial, and regional identity.</p>
    
    <p>
Federico’s version of a private study was extraordinary, but in the centuries that followed, as people continued to flock from the countryside to the cities,
such “thinking rooms” served a need that became more and more common. The fad for the studiolo spread north through Europe, as people of means added such rooms to their homes. Like Federico’s study, these spaces often featured displays of meaningful or sacred objects: collections of books, scientific and musical instruments, religious relics. And they carved out a space of undisturbed quiet— space that made deep, fresh thinking possible.</p>
    
    <p> For one of the sixteenth century’s most original thinkers, Michel de Montaigne, the study became a central metaphor for the freedom of thought he prized. (Montaigne, it should be noted,
was not only a man of letters but also mayor of the city of Bordeaux.) Amid the hustle and bustle of social and commercial life, “we must reserve a back room,
wholly our own and entirely free, wherein to settle our true liberty, our principal solitude and retreat,” wrote Montaigne in his essay “Of Solitude.” Montaigne’s term for this room—arrière-boutique, or literally “behind the shop”—speaks to the close relationship between busy engagement and quiet withdrawal.</p>
    
    <p> In this room, Montaigne added, “we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves.” For many of us, that space has now largely disappeared; starting in the middle of the twentieth century, the walls that had gone up hundreds of years earlier began to come down. In every sort of building—homes, schools, offices—walls that had once been welcomed as guardians of discrete or dedicated spaces were now disparaged as interruptions of a desired “openness.” An unstructured space of potential came to feel preferable to a closed-off space of definition.</p>
