When people can’t engage in such mimicking, they have a harder time figuring out what others are feeling. A striking example: people injected with the wrinkle reducer Botox, which works by inducing mild paralysis of the muscles used to generate facial expressions, are less accurate in their perceptions of others’ emotions—presumably because they can’t simulate others’ feelings within themselves. On the other end of the spectrum, interoceptively attuned people are more likely to mimic the expressions of others, and more accurate in their interpretation of others’ feelings, than are people who are less aware of their bodily sensations. They also tend to have more empathy for others.</p>
    
    <p> Via mimicking, all of us “feel” the pain of others: research demonstrates that the areas of the brain involved in sensing our own pain are also activated when we see other people experience physical harm. But when interoceptively attuned people view someone experiencing pain, they rate the other person’s pain as more intense.
The interoceptive champions among us may be clinical psychologists, who are professionally trained to read their own bodies’ signals for clues to what their patients are feeling—even when their clients are not yet able to verbalize their emotions. “For me it’s like using the body as radar, you think of those sort of dishes that collect satellite messages and funnel them down—well, I see the body in that way,” observed one clinician in a 2004 study of how therapists use their bodies to understand their patients.</p>
    
    <p> In similar fashion, Susie Orbach, a clinical psychologist and the author of groundbreaking books on women and body image, has found that her own body is a sensitive instrument for picking up on what her patients are feeling. Focusing on the sensations that well up inside her during therapy, says Orbach, “has helped me to realize that the body’s development is every bit as crucial as the mind’s.” Like psychotherapists, we can develop the capacity of the body to enhance our connections with others—a faculty called “social interoception.” Research suggests that looking our conversational partner directly in the eye increases our interoceptive attunement, as does a brief touch on the hand or the arm.</p>
    
    <p> Studies also show that when interpersonal situations become challenging—when we feel socially rejected or excluded, for example—we tend to shift our focus away from our own internal sensations and toward external events, perhaps in an urgent effort to repair the breach. This shift, however well intentioned, may cut us off from a source of insight about the other person just when we need it most.
Better to attempt a flexible back-and-forth movement between attending to others’ social cues and to our own interoceptive signals (a process that recalls Elizabeth Stanley’s technique of “shuttling”). By drawing on data from both sources, we can feel our way into the other person’s emotional world while maintaining a vivid sense of our own.</p>

 JOHN COATES, the trader turned scientist we met at the beginning of this chapter,
likens our bodies to “sensitive parabolic reflectors, registering a wealth of predictive information.” These biological antennae are continually receiving and sending important messages, he notes, yet “these messages are notoriously,
frustratingly hard to hear. They fade in and out like a radio picking up a distant station.” Coates believes that technology can help—not by replacing gut feelings with data-driven algorithms, but by amplifying the body’s own accumulated insight.</p>
    
    <p> He has now embarked on a third career, this time as an entrepreneur. His company, Dewline Research, collects data on financial traders’ physiological signals via wearable sensors, tracking the relationship between the gyrations of the market and the traders’ bodily reactions.
Another group of interoception researchers, meanwhile, have developed a similar device—this one oriented around enhancing the body’s role in promoting resilience. Heartrater, a technology introduced by scientists at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the UK, allows athletes to monitor their internal climate more closely, permitting a more efficient use of energy and a more rapid recovery from exertion.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps the most intriguing use of such extended technology—that is, digital tools extended by the body—has been pioneered by interoception researcher Manos Tsakiris, a professor of psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London. With a team from the firm Empathic Technologies, he helped develop a device called doppel. It provides users with bodily feedback that is not amplified but rather deliberately distorted; in effect,
doppel seeks to trick the user into believing that her heart is beating slower or faster than it actually is.
Recall that—as William James explained so eloquently—our brains take their cues about the emotions we’re experiencing from the sensations generated by the body.</p>
    
    <p> Tsakiris’s device intervenes in this loop by offering the brain a message that is different from the one the body is actually producing. Worn on the wrist like a watch or a Fitbit, doppel generates the persuasive sensation of a slow,
relaxed heartbeat—or, on a different setting, of a fast, excited one. When set to slow mode, doppel induces a sense of calm in people who are nervous about having to engage in public speaking; when it’s in fast mode, people wearing the device are more alert and more accurate in their performance on a challenging test of sustained attention. The technology allows us, says Tsakiris, “to harvest our natural responses to heartbeat-like rhythms” in the interest of improving our performance.</p>

That such trickery is even possible only serves to underline the robustness of the connection between body and mind, the two-way flow of information that does so much to shape our daily decisions, our everyday efforts, our most intimate relationships. This link may also form the foundation of something even more fundamental: our sense of self. Among all their other functions, the steady flow of internal sensations we experience provides us with a sense of personal continuity. Thinkers have long mused on how it is that we can regard ourselves as unique and persistently existing entities.</p>
    
    <p> “What makes me the same person throughout my life, and a different person from you?” wondered the late philosopher Derek Parfit. Their answers have usually had something to do with the brain—with our thoughts or our memories. As the French philosopher René Descartes declared, “I think, therefore I am.” According to neuroanatomist and interoception expert A.</p>
