    <p> The first generation of cognitive scientists “took seriously the idea thatthe mind is a kind of computer,” notes Brown University professor StevenSloman. “Thinking was assumed to be a kind of computer program that runs inpeople’s brains.”Since those early days at the dawn of the digital age, the brain-computeranalogy has become only more pervasive and more powerful, engaged not justby researchers and academics but by the rest of us, the public at large. Themetaphor provides us with a model, sometimes conscious but often implicit, ofhow thinking works.</p>
    
    <p> The brain, according to this analogy, is a self-containedinformation-processing machine, sealed inside the skull as the ENIAC wassequestered in its locked room. From this inference emerges a second: thehuman brain has attributes, akin to gigabytes of RAM and megahertz ofprocessing speed, that can be easily measured and compared. Following on theseis the third and perhaps most significant supposition of all: that some brains, likesome computers, are just better; they possess the biological equivalent of morememory storage, greater processing power, higher-resolution screens.To this day, the computer metaphor dominates the way we think and talkabout mental activity—but it’s not the only one that shapes our notion of thebrain.</p>
    
    <p> A half-century after the ENIAC was unveiled, another analogy rose toprominence.“NEW RESEARCH SHOWS That the Brain Can Be Developed Like a Muscle,” readthe headline of the news article, set in bold type. The year was 2002, and LisaBlackwell, a graduate student at Columbia University working with psychologyprofessor Carol Dweck, was handing out copies of the article to a classroom fullof seventh-graders at a public school in New York City. Dweck and Blackwellwere testing a new theory, investigating the possibility that the way weconceptualize the brain can affect how well we think.</p>
    
    <p> The study’s protocolrequired Blackwell to guide the students through eight informational sessions; inthis, the third session in the sequence, students were to take turns reading the textof the article aloud.“Many people believe that a person is born either smart, average, or dumb—and stays that way,” one student began. “But new research shows that the brainis more like a muscle—it changes and gets stronger when you use it.” Anotherstudent picked up the thread: “Everyone knows that when you lift weights, yourmuscles get bigger and you get stronger.</p>
    
    <p> A person who can’t lift 20 poundswhen they start exercising can get strong enough to lift 100 pounds afterworking out for a long time. That’s because the muscles become larger andstronger with exercise. And when you stop exercising, the muscles shrink andyou get weaker. That’s why people say, ‘Use it or lose it!’ ” A giggle rippledthrough the room.</p>
    
    <p> “But,” a third pupil read on, “most people don’t know thatwhen they practice and learn new things, parts of their brain change and getlarger, a lot like muscles do when they exercise.”Dweck’s idea, which she initially called “the incremental theory ofintelligence,” would eventually become known to the world as the “growthmindset”: the belief that concerted mental effort could make people smarter, justas vigorous physical effort could make people stronger. As she and hercolleagues wrote in an account of their early research in schools, “The keymessage was that learning changes the brain by forming new connections, andthat students are in charge of this process.” From these beginnings, growthmindset became a popular phenomenon—spawning a book, Mindset, that hassold millions of copies, and inspiring an untold number of speeches,presentations, and workshops, delivered to corporate and organizationalaudiences as well as to students and teachers.</p>
    
    <p>At the center of it all is a metaphor: the brain as muscle. The mind, in thisanalogy, is akin to a biceps or a quadriceps—a physical entity that varies instrength among individuals. The comparison has been incorporated into anotherhugely popular concept originating in academic psychology: “grit.” AngelaDuckworth, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist who defines grit as“perseverance and passion for long-term goals,” echoes Dweck in her own book.</p>
    
    <p>“Like a muscle that gets stronger with use, the brain changes itself when youstruggle to master a new challenge,” she wrote in the best-selling Grit, publishedin 2016. The emphasis in Grit on mustering more of one’s own internalresources makes the brain-as-muscle analogy a perfect fit. The comparison ismade even more explicitly by purveyors of so-called “cognitive fitness”exercises, which have drawn millions of hopeful users under names like“CogniFit” and “Brain Gym.” (So pervasive is the metaphor that some scientistsconcerned about the spread of “neuromyths”—common misconceptions aboutthe brain—have begun to point out that the brain is not actually a muscle butrather an organ made up of specialized cells known as neurons.</p>
    
    <p>)These two metaphors—brain as computer and brain as muscle—share somekey assumptions. To wit: the mind is a discrete thing that is sealed in the skull;this discrete thing determines how well people are able to think; this thing hasstable properties that can easily be measured, compared, and ranked. Suchassumptions feel comfortably familiar; indeed, they weren’t particularly noveleven at the moment they were first proposed. For centuries, brains had beenlikened to machines—to whichever appliance of the time appeared mostadvanced: a hydraulic pump, a mechanical clock, a steam engine, a telegraphmachine.</p>
    
    <p>In a lecture delivered in 1984, philosopher John Searle noted: “Because we donot understand the brain very well, we are constantly tempted to use the latesttechnology as a model for trying to understand it. In my childhood we werealways assured that the brain was a telephone switchboard.” Teachers, parents,and other adults all proffered the metaphor of brain as switchboard, recountedSearle, for “what else could it be?”Brains had also long been likened to muscles that could be strengthened withexercise—a theme promulgated, for example, by physicians and health expertsin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In his First Book in Physiologyand Hygiene, published in 1888, doctor John Harvey Kellogg made an argumentthat sounds very much like Carol Dweck’s.</p>
