    <p> They know that kinder people are well-liked,
and generosity is taken to mean that a person is good at heart. Predators will not care much for kindness but will go to great lengths to paint the required picture of perfection. They will show up to community gatherings with home-baked cookies. At charity events, they will have the biggest check.</p>
    
    <p>
They will always have the brightest, and warmest smiles. On the surface,
they will be the picture of neighborly friendliness and hospitality. That is why they always catch people unaware when they decide to unveil their other side--the one that is not as kind and not as generous.
When dealing with someone who goes to great lengths to prove that they are a really nice person, take with you a pinch of salt.</p>
    
    <p> Pay attention to what your gut says about this person. Your ears and eyes may deceive you, but that inner voice of reason will always have your back.
They like to be the victims One of the best ways to deflect attention from your wrongdoings is to turn the spotlight onto another personâ€™s wrongdoings. Human predators have mastered the art of playing the victim.</p>
    
    <p> It allows them enough time to victimize another person while everyone else is distracted. A person that plays the victim will never apologize for anything they do. If they are late,
it is because someone else sent the wrong meeting invitation. If they cheated, it is because their partner did not pay them enough attention.</p>
    
    <p> If they hit another person, it is because that person made them so mad that it drove them to violence. It is always one story or another.
The truth of the matter is that the predator is never the victim. They are often incapable of being the victim.</p>
    
    <p> After all, they have orchestrated their lives and those of others to suit their own interest. However, predators also know that people like to feel sorry for victims. As such, they will play the victim for as long as it suits them.
With this understanding of how predators look like, you might be wondering what steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>
    
    <p> First, it is important to acknowledge that this first chapter only touches the surface of dark psychology and the players therein. The subsequent chapters will dig deeper into peeling back the more intricate issues at play. At the end of this deep dive, you will have gained an even better understanding of how manipulators and other dark characters operate. This knowledge will help you to protect yourself and, if need be, turn the tables as appropriate.</p>
    
    <p> That being said, you can still protect yourself as early as now.
Basics of Defending Yourself Against Human Predators The first thing you need to know is how to identify the props that the predator is using to disguise their real self from you. This could be faked kindness and generosity in the form of excessive gifts or forced affection.
Beware of anyone who comes across as too perfect.</p>
