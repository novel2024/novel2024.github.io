 ON FEBRUARY 14, 1946, a breathless bustle filled the halls of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. On this day, the school’s secret jewel was going to be revealed to the world: the ENIAC. Inside a locked room at Moore hummed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the first machine of its kind capable of performing calculations at lightning speed.
Weighing thirty tons, the massive ENIAC used around eighteen thousand vacuum tubes, employed about six thousand switches, and encompassed upwards of half a million soldered joints; it had taken more than 200,000 man- hours to build.</p>
    
    <p>
The bus-sized contraption was the brainchild of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert Jr., two young scientists at the University of Pennsylvania, Moore’s parent institution. With funding from the US Army, the ENIAC had been developed for the purpose of computing artillery trajectories for American gunners fighting the war in Europe.</p>
    
    <p> Compiling trajectory tables—necessary for the effective use of new weapons being introduced by the military—was a laborious process, requiring the service of teams of human “computers” working in shifts around the clock. A machine that could do their job with speed and accuracy would give the army an invaluable edge.
Now, six months after V-Day, the demands of wartime were giving way to the Now, six months after V-Day, the demands of wartime were giving way to the needs of an expanding economy, and Mauchly and Eckert had called a press conference to introduce their invention to the world. The two men had prepared for the event with deliberate care, and no small amount of stagecraft.</p>
    
    <p> As the ENIAC chugged away at a given task, some three hundred neon lights built into the machine’s accumulators flickered and flashed. Presper Eckert, known to all as “Pres,” judged the effect of these small bulbs insufficiently impressive. On the morning of the press conference, he ran out and purchased an armful of Ping- Pong balls, each of which he cut in half and marked with a number. The plastic domes, glued over the neon bulbs, now cast a dramatic glow—especially once the room’s overhead lights were dimmed.</p>
    
    <p>
At the appointed hour, the door to the room that held the ENIAC was opened,
and a gaggle of officials, academics, and journalists filed in. Standing in front of the hulking machine, lab member Arthur Burks welcomed the group and sought to impart to them a sense of the moment’s magnitude. The ENIAC was engineered to carry out mathematical operations, he explained, and these operations, “if made to take place rapidly enough, might in time solve almost any problem.” Burks announced that he would begin the day’s demonstration by asking the ENIAC to multiply 97,367 by itself five thousand times.</p>
    
    <p> The reporters in the room bent over their notepads. “Watch closely, you may miss it,” he warned, and pushed a button; before the newsmen had time to look up, the task was complete, executed on a punch card delivered to Burks’s hand.
Next Burks fed the machine a problem like those for which it had been designed: the ENIAC would now calculate the trajectory of a shell taking thirty seconds to travel from the gun to its target. Such a task would take a team of human experts three days to compute; the ENIAC completed the job in twenty seconds, faster than the shell itself could fly.</p>
    
    <p> Jean Bartik, one of a group of pioneering female engineers who helped program the ENIAC, was on hand for the demonstration. She recalled, “It was unheard of that a machine could reach such speeds of calculation, and everyone in the room, even the great mathematicians, were in complete wonder and awe at what they had just seen.” The next day, admiring accounts of the ENIAC appeared in newspapers all over the world. “PHILADELPHIA—One of the war’s top secrets, an amazing machine which applies electronic speeds for the first time to mathematical tasks hitherto too difficult and cumbersome for solution, was announced here tonight by the War Department,” the New York Times reported on its front page.</p>
    
    <p> The Times reporter, T. R. Kennedy Jr., sounded dazzled by what he’d seen.</p>
