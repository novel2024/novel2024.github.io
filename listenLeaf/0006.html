    <p> The best prison is the one with invisible bars.
Perhaps one reason for this complacency is the large quantity of material goods available to the chain gang. Material goods are often used as compensation. Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is "Go out and spend some money.</p>
    
    <p> Buy yourself something nice. Treat yourself.
Try a little retail therapy." People don't seem to realize that this attempt to feel good is exactly what propagates the problem.</p>
    
    <p> Compared to people just 50 years ago, modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance. They're consumers. They have big-screen TVs, movies on demand, microwave ovens, food processors, and 24-piece flatware. They own multiple pairs of shoes and enough clothes for more than a week without doing laundry.</p>
    
    <p>
They have carpeted floors, matching furniture, and vacuum cleaners. They have expensive toys. They have car payments, college degrees, five- bedroom/three-bathroom mortgages,
laptop computers,
cell phone contracts, power tools with 108-piece bit sets, premium cable, air conditioning systems, blenders, food processors, pool tables, DVD players,
and granite countertops. They redecorate, attend sporting events, go on vacations, and occasionally play with their toys.</p>

Society has made it very easy to spend money. Shopping centers line every street. Many creative means of spending money have been devised.
Instead of spending 30 seconds opening a can of tomatoes with a traditional can opener, it's now possible to spend 30 minutes working to pay for an electric can opener that can open the can in the same amount of time.</p>
    
    <p>
Similarly, many of the ways we used to do things have been redesigned to ensure that instead of doing it ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us. This is convenient, because we're usually too busy working to pay for it to do it ourselves. This is the gist of the service economy; presumably, if we didn't create enough problems to spend time solving them, the economy would collapse.
To speed up consumption, it's possible to obtain loans and spend money that's yet to be earned.</p>
    
    <p> All it requires is a promise of increased amounts of work in the future, and a commitment of up to 30 years to pay the money back--plus twice the amount in interest. Lots of personal finance gurus are willing to charge you money (some will do it for free) to advise you as to exactly how to distribute your money into retirement plans, college savings plans, mortgages, credit cards, etc.Â to maximize your lifetime consumption.
Success and power are equated with spending money.</p>

It usually starts with toys for the children and quickly evolves to cell phones and fashionable clothes. Many realize that demonstrating their personal values through the color and build of their cell phone is perhaps inadequate and then move on to bigger and more expensive propositions like large cars, redecorating, or kitchen renovating. Not that there's anything wrong with such creative outlets, but the scale of these "projects" is often mind-boggling, with tens of thousands being spent on marginal increases in functionality. The old but typically fully functioning items are discarded,
especially if they have those ugly 1970s earth tone colors, or that bland 1980s beige, or whatever we had in the 1990s, etc.</p>
