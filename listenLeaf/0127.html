    <p> When it rains, the bottom should be wide. If it's snug, water will just run onto the pants. The waist doesn't matter in terms of rain. Generally, if it's cold, the waist should be loose.</p>
    
    <p> If it's warm, it doesn't matter. Most shells will have the option for a zip-in fleece. Get a liner that fits the zipper. Often it doesn't have to be the same brand, as long as it fits.</p>
    
    <p> Pants are much less important than one might think. Unless we're talking heavy rain under windy conditions, jeans are perfectly alright. Remember, when walking, rain comes mainly from above.
Therefore, cheap rain pants will do.</p>
    
    <p> The problem here is that moisture from the inside will get your pants wet anyway. Therefore I often prefer to wear a loose set of pants on top of my regular pants. Jogging pants work fine for this. They do get wet, but since they are loose, the water doesn't transfer to the layer below.</p>
    
    <p> One important point is not to tuck the pants legs into the boots or socks. The bottom of the pants will get wet and transfer to whatever they touch.
Depending on the level of flooding, hiking boots are recommended. If you're walking regularly, I'd get a pair anyway.</p>
    
    <p> Personally, the quality I demand doesn't cost less than $200. The cheaper ones only last a couple thousand miles before the seams start breaking. My current pair of boots are almost as old as my jacket and I've walked many thousands of miles in them. This means an annual depreciation cost of about $20, if maintenance is expensed separately.</p>
    
    <p> They are full grain leather. I don't like nubuck because it doesn't last as long and it doesn't survive long against rock, in the case of serious hiking. It goes without saying that I'd never get anything with nylon in it. My boots have a stitched Norwegian welt.</p>
    
    <p> Stitched welts are getting hard to find these days since $100 glued sole boots sell better,
but some companies still make them. If you get a chance to buy a pair, jump on it--maybe buy two or three pairs so you're covered for life! Having used a lot of leather fat and polish, I've made mine quite water-resistant and wouldn't think twice about walking through a two inch deep water puddle.
Find a good cobbler who will put in good replacement soles, preferably the same as the original soles or better, rather than a cheap sole that has to be replaced again in a year.
This outfit should work for most situations.</p>
