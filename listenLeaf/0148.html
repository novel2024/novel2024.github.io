    <p>110 This figure shows the time it takes to grow the fund to 30 years as a function of savings rate. According to this figure, a 30-year fund will last 70 years even at a modest 3% return rate.
The time M it takes to grow P0/p to 30 for a given savings rate r. A fund nominally lasting 30 years should be safe to retire on in most circumstances.</p>
    
    <p> Note that a traditional savings rate of 15% requires a little over 30 years of work to make it given average investment returns of 10%. If, on the other hand, investment returns drop to a conservative 6%, more than 45 years of work is required.
Let us isolate M from this equation to get M =log(1+i(P0)/(p)(1-r)/(r))/log(1+i).
Assuming that the life expectancy is 100 years and one is either financially independent or working to become so for the last 80 years of that time span (adjust your numbers as you see fit), then 80 = N + M,
where N is the number of years living off your money and M is the number of years spent accumulating it.</p>
    
    <p> We can now plot the working time M as a function of the savings rate r to find out how many years are needed to work to accumulate enough money for a given rate of return i. This is shown in this figure. This is the most important figure in this chapter.
Specifically, it shows that high savings rates lead to extremely early financial independence.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, the traditionally recommended savings rates mean working for 40 years or more, and they're very dependent on the return rate i. It also shows the difference between a savings rate of, say 35%, which most people would consider to be high, and a savings rate of 70%. It shows what your savings rate r should be to retire in M years. As is evident, saving three quarters of one's income creates financial independence in about five years! Conversely, a savings rate of 15% requires about 35 years of work at an optimistic return rate of 6%, about 20 years of work at a 10% rate, and about 45 years at a 4% rate.</p>

Figure showing savings rate against years to retirement for a range of investment return rates, presuming that the total number of years worked and years retired equals 80--for example, a person starts working at 20 and dies at 100.
Investing and reasonable return rates In the real world, it is unlikely that i will stay constant. The principal P may also vary substantially if it is invested in the market. Furthermore,
there is inflation to contend with.</p>
    
    <p> The equations derived in Financial independence and investing therefore either have to be expanded or used with a significant margin of safety. It's very tempting to plug in return rates of 10% or even higher and derive very favorable terms--for example, a mere 15% savings rate and a return rate of 10% allows one to retire "early" after about 20 years of work. The problem with such exercises is known as "garbage in-garbage out". The limitations of the formulae must be understood to use them.</p>
    
    <p> The financial world abounds with stories of people and companies that put too much faith in their equations without understanding the limits.
To give an example of a more realistic derivation, suppose we invest in a broad market index and assume that future rates of return and future rates of inflation will exactly match those of the past. Then we can pick a historical set of returns and go through a calculation like above, except each year we use the value of i equal to that of the market return for the corresponding year. Additionally, we account for inflation by using the corresponding historical values, increasing p by the rate of inflation for each year.</p>
    
    <p> This can be done numerically. The analytic equation is just a quick way to derive the result when the values are assumed to be constant.
If calculated numerically with historic data, it will quickly be found that the results N and M we want vary depending on the range of years the historic data are taken from. Using data from 1980 to 2005 will be different from using data from 1935 to 1960.</p>
