    <p> Picture a group of American citizens placing their right hands over their hearts and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, for example, or a Catholic congregation kneeling and bowing their heads, speaking aloud the same words at the same time from the missal.
Synchrony is a highly effective “biotechnology of group formation,” as neuroscientist Walter Freeman put it—but why would such a technology be necessary?
Because, says Jonathan Haidt, “human nature is 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee.” Haidt, a psychologist at NYU’s Stern School of Business, notes that in the main, we are competitive, self-interested animals intent on pursuing our own ends. That’s the chimp part.</p>
    
    <p> But we can also be like bees—“ultrasocial” creatures who are able to think and act as one for the good of the group. Haidt argues for the existence in humans of a psychological trigger he calls the “hive switch.” When the hive switch is flipped, our minds shift from an individual focus to a group focus—from “I” mode to “we” mode. Getting this switch to turn on is the key to thinking together to get things done, to extending our individual minds with the groups to which we belong.</p>
    
    <p>
Synchronous movement is one way of flipping this switch; it reliably produces what the late historian William McNeill called “muscular bonding.” He maintained that the long-standing dominance of European armies over other fighting forces was due in part to the psychological effect of close-order drill, a practice that took root in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century before spreading to other European nations. Soldiers spent hours marching in formation, their movements tightly coordinated—thereby creating a mental and emotional bond that elevated their performance on the battlefield.
McNeill, a distinguished military scholar, wrote about the transformative effect of martial drills not only from his erudition but from his personal experience as well.</p>
    
    <p> As a young man, he was drafted into the US Army and sent to basic training in Texas. There he and his fellow recruits were ordered to march, “hour after hour, moving in unison and by the numbers in response to shouted commands, sweating in the hot sun, and, every so often, counting out the cadence as we marched: Hut! Hup! Hip! Four!” McNeill recounted. “A more useless exercise would be hard to imagine,” he notes wryly, and yet as the hours wore on, he found himself entering “a state of generalized emotional exaltation.” “Words are inadequate to describe the emotion aroused by the prolonged movement in unison that drilling involved,” he wrote.</p>
    
    <p> “A sense of pervasive well-being is what I recall; more specifically, a strange sense of personal enlargement; a sort of swelling out, becoming bigger than life, thanks to participation in collective ritual.” McNeill continued, “Obviously, something visceral was at work; something, I later concluded, far older than language and critically important in human history, because the emotion it arouses constitutes an indefinitely expansible basis for social cohesion among any and every group that keeps together in time, moving big muscles together and chanting, singing,
or shouting rhythmically.” What happened to McNeill and his comrades on that “dusty, graveled patch of the Texas plain” was surely the product of behavioral synchrony, of moving together in a coordinated manner. But there was likely another factor affecting them as well: not just shared movement but shared arousal.</p>
    
    <p> Their bodies’ common response to the physical exertion of marching, the heat of the sun, the shouted commands of their superiors—this too supported the emergence of a group mind.
The significance of shared arousal was demonstrated in an ingenious experiment designed by researcher Joshua Conrad Jackson and published in the journal Scientific Reports in 2018. Jackson and his colleagues set out “to simulate conditions found in actual marching rituals”—which, they noted,
“required the use of a larger venue than a traditional psychology laboratory.” They chose as the setting for their study a professional sports stadium, with a high-definition camera mounted twenty-five meters above the action.</p>
    
    <p> After gathering 172 participants in the stadium and dividing them into groups, the experimenters manipulated their experience of both synchrony and arousal: one group was directed to walk with their fellow members in rank formation, while a second group walked in a loose and uncoordinated fashion; a third group speed- walked around the stadium, boosting their physiological arousal, while a fourth group strolled at a leisurely pace. Jackson and his collaborators then had each group engage in the same set of activities, asking them to gather themselves into cliques, to disperse themselves as they wished across the stadium’s playing field,
and finally to cooperate in a joint task (collecting five hundred metal washers scattered across the field).
The result: when participants had synchronized with one another, and when they had experienced arousal together, they then behaved in a distinctive way— forming more inclusive groups, standing closer to one another, and working together more efficiently (observations made possible by analyzing footage recorded by the roof-mounted camera). The findings suggest that “behavioral synchrony and shared physiological arousal in small groups independently increase social cohesion and cooperation,” the researchers write; they help us understand “why synchrony and arousal often co-occur in rituals around the world.</p>
    
    <p>” As demonstrated in this study, physical exertion is a dependable method of producing physiological arousal—but it’s not the only one. An experience of heightened emotion will also do the trick. Whether hearts are racing as a result of running laps or because of hearing an exciting story, such shared arousal is another way of getting a group of individuals to cohere. In behavioral synchrony,
group members are moving their arms and legs as if they were one being; in physiological synchrony, their hearts are beating and their skin is perspiring as if they were one body.</p>
