    <p> Take up hobbies and crafts with a manual component. If you spend your evenings doing carpentry or baking (real baking, not powder mixing) it's unlikely that you'll be cold even if the central heating is off.
With all this talk of generating heat, it may be interesting to know that a seated person emits around 100W (a sleeping person around 80W). This number is higher for someone who has exercised intensely within the past 24 hours.</p>
    
    <p> 100W is not much, but it's interesting to consider that if you fill a room with people, they'll heat it up. High-intensity workouts generate more than 1000W (see High intensity interval training), which is comparable to a small space heater. For room-heating purposes you can substitute the company of 10 friends with one intensely exercising person.
External heat sources offer a less convenient solution, since they must be lugged around.</p>
    
    <p> They're like the difference between knowing the multiplication table by heart and having to use a calculator. The modern solution is the electric blanket. For half a monthly heating bill, you can buy a heating blanket that will reduce your central heating bills forever. An older, less expensive, and therefore harder to find, solution is the hot water bottle.</p>
    
    <p> As an alternative, you can use a rice bag. Take an old pillow case and sew in a few cups of uncooked rice. Heat this in the microwave. The heat capacity isn't as good as the hot water bottle.</p>
    
    <p> These heat sources should be covered by an insulating layer or you'll lose more than half the heat. With the hot water bottle, you can simply stuff it under your sweater. Preventing heat loss is as important as generating it in the first place. This is where adding layers of clothes outside the body comes in handy.</p>
    
    <p> It's important to add layers preemptively. If layers aren't added, the body will withdraw blood from the limbs to save heat. Once this happens and you've got cold feet, the blood will not return and reheat the feet even after you put on extra socks. In this case, heat must be generated in the feet by stamping, walking,
jumping, or on the feet, by rubbing them.</p>
    
    <p> An alternative is to use biofeedback. This requires some practice. Concentrate on your feet and imagine they're in warm water or you're standing on hot coals. It may take a few minutes to get it to work and it may take several months of practice to learn to control it.</p>
    
    <p>
Air doesn't conduct heat well and layers trap air. Thus, trapping air prevents heat transfer to or from the environment. If you stick your hand into a 100C (212F) oven, you won't get burned immediately. If you touch 100C water, you'll get burned immediately.</p>
