    <p> However, ironically, it turned out that TV was much better at keeping people from learning. This fits perfectly with the focus on specialization. During the day, professionals attend to their jobs. During the evenings, they vegetate in front of their TVs,
thereby prevented from learning anything, and this effectively keeps them in their jobs.</p>
    
    <p> Actually, the closer you get to middle-class values and neighborhoods, the greater the preponderance of silent streets; all you see in the evening are empty streets and a faint blue hue emanating from behind the curtains of every house.
In my experience, by going cold turkey, it takes about a week to get rid of a TV addiction. There's no pain, save an empty spot in the room and perhaps the loss of hundreds of imaginary friends (mostly detectives,
doctors, lawyers, and spaceship captains) you have vicariously lived through yet learned nothing about. If you still need your fix, you can swap,
borrow, or rent DVDs and watch those instead.</p>

Money, credit, and insurance I'm not a big fan of automatizing personal finances. In my opinion, the only thing worse than automatic control is no control. The former is,
however, a large improvement over the latter. The most important reason for this is that automatic procedures eventually fail.</p>
    
    <p> A missed automatic transfer due to some institution changing their procedures might result in cascading failure of everything linked to that account. When this happens,
companies love to slap you with exorbitant fees.
The systemic problem is forced complexity and tight coupling. You can't get rid of the forced complexity without giving up automatization.</p>
    
    <p>
However, you can decouple by keeping a buffer amount in each account comparable to the maximum amount you have/will ever withdraw from the account. Keeping all these buffers has opportunity costs, but think of them as a cash reserve that could be used elsewhere, if you cancel all the automatic systems.
Credit cards Credit cards are mostly a nonissue in the Renaissance lifestyle. The rich may use credit, but the wealthy don't.</p>
    
    <p> Leave rewards, cash back, and frequent flyer miles to consumers and high spenders. If you never carry a balance, as nobody should, negotiating interest rates is irrelevant. If you spend less than $4,000 a year using the credit card, selecting the "best card" is a waste of time as far as I'm concerned. The only reason I have a credit card is to pay for things online with a modicum of protection against identity theft.</p>
    
    <p>
Cash back is slightly worthwhile and comparable to the free float of the balance you run up. Suppose you spend $300 a month; then 1% cash back will result in $36 a year. The $300 float can be invested at, say 10%/year,
which yields $30. Obviously, the $3,600 which is spent during this process is gone.</p>
    
    <p> Spending money to get rewards is never profitable.
People in the US have to deal with a secret formula, the so-called credit score, which attempts to evaluate their credit risk based on previous behavior with debt. I see no reason to engage in credit behavior based on superstitious beliefs about a formula which is secret. Credit scores are irrelevant because obtaining a loan is irrelevant.</p>
