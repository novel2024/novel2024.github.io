(59) No, I'm not being paid to promote these items. I just like them.
(60) Getting actively engaged in the community later led to a book deal,
The Final Energy Crisis, Pluto Press, 2005, and several connections with international experts.
(61) Durability depends on quality, but first and foremost on whether you use a dryer instead of a clothesline.</p>
    
    <p> Consider all the lint the dryer picks up during the process; these are clothing fibers that come from clothes.
Line-drying doesn't result in a similar "sanding." With line-drying,
you're closer to a 200-wash life cycle. If you hand-wash or at least run a gentler cycle, you may reach even higher numbers.</p>
    
    <p>
(62) This happens because manufactures assume that the item is going to be thrown away rather than repaired, and thus they have ensured that no particular parts are overbuilt.
(63) This can be a great idea when you don't want to own the thing--for example, toxic cleaners, cars, etc. It isn't great if you want fee-less ownership.
(64) My local library has a web page showing new additions to their movie catalog for the most recent month.</p>
    
    <p>
(65) When shopping online, the newest strategy is to use computers to analyze shopping trends and offer different prices to different people on different days. Using limit orders avoids this. If you want to beat the system, try reloading the page or delete the site cookies and try again.
(66) Lest I give the impression that the skilled trades are really that easy, let me say that they're easy in principle, but quickly discovering what the problem is requires a large collection of tacit knowledge.</p>
    
    <p> Without this knowledge, the apprentice will have to try a lot of possible solutions before hitting on the right one. In other words, the expert will be able to do the same job much faster, but the apprentice will actually be able to do the job about as well--it will just take much longer.
(67) Fighting succession requires a lot of resources to prevent the next natural seral stage. Letting succession work for you saves a lot of money (also see Succession and the cycle of change).</p>
    
    <p>
(68) Obviously this number varies wildly as real estate has a very large price range depending on location. In some parts of the United States you can get a mansion with a few acres and a lake for the price of a bungalow in the pricier areas.
(69) For example, a motorhome or a boat is a home under those conditions,
and thus interest on a loan for such would be tax-deductible. Also,
there may be other benefits of the politically influential homeowner class to be had.</p>
    
    <p>
(70) The same goes for doing IPOs and buying and selling stocks on Wall Street.
(71) Many times the argument is made that the interest can be deducted (government subsidies). However, if the tax bracket is 25%, then paying the bank $100 to save $25 in taxes for a net loss of $75 still seems like a losing deal. If you were in a 100% tax bracket, it would obviously be a great idea.</p>

(72) Maintaining a bike in wet conditions requires about 15 minutes after each trip wiping it down, so it may be faster to leave the bike at home.
(73) If appearances are important, wear an expensive suit or develop some other luxury eccentricity. It's certainly less expensive than housing.
(74) Radiative (warm and cold sources in your vicinity), conductive (ambient temperature), evaporative (humidity and ability to sweat),
and convective (wind chill) heat transfers.</p>
