    <p> I saved cash at a measly interest rate in a bank account for four years while reading about stock investing before I began investing in stocks. This doesn't mean that you have to invest in stocks too. Furthermore, because I invest in stocks now doesn't mean I will be doing so for the next 50 years. If circumstances change, I'll change.</p>
    
    <p> Study the alternatives. Read, read, and then read some more.111 This is what investors do. This is what I do.</p>
    
    <p>
Beware of the promise of high returns in general or brand new untested methods of investing. It's easy to get burned by this. If consistent returns of 12% or even 24% per year are possible, the fund size can be small indeed.
However, if a new or exotic method (pig lending?) promises high returns,
it's almost guaranteed that those returns will go down as more people buy in, or that the returns are simply not sustainable because the risks are far higher than anticipated.</p>
    
    <p>
That said, if you decide that you have no interest in managing your own money, it's, as always, possible to pay money to compensate. You can pay another person to manage your money, you can pay for your mistakes, or you can pay in terms of opportunity costs for having an underperforming portfolio.
In all these, the cost relative to the withdrawal rate will be high because the withdrawal rate is generally low. Typical management fees are asset- based and could easily be 1%, which has to come out of the withdrawal rate.</p>
    
    <p>112 For example, if the withdrawal rate is 4% and 1% goes to fees, it only leaves 3% for expenses; in other words, 25% of the cash flow is spent on management fees. With fees this high, it means that the fund has to be proportionally larger to support financial independence. Is it worth it to spend time and effort learning how to manage your money yourself rather than increasing M? That's up to you.
Asset management Asset-based income is fundamentally different from work-based income.</p>
    
    <p> The primary difference is that asset-based income is proportional to assets and skill, whereas work-based income is proportional to time spent and skill.
Both require skills, albeit different skills, so the difference is time versus assets. Naturally, asset management requires some time--for example, to think and observe--and work requires some assets like tools and resources, but the ratio between them is markedly different.
Consider a scenario where $2,000 in assets yields 4% ($80) without effort, but where asset management will raise the yield to 6% ($120).</p>
    
    <p> This is a difference of $40 from a few hours of work--it's presumed that the hours spent learning to do this work won't need to be repeated; once learned, there's no need to relearn. Spending more than a couple hours managing $1,000 in assets is therefore not worthwhile, as the hourly return on time would dip below the working wage. Now consider having $200,000 in assets yielding 4% ($8,000). Raising the yield to 6% ($12,000) is a difference of $4,000, which is a very nice return for a few hours of effort,
the exact same work effort but now leveraged with more assets.</p>
    
    <p> Two observations: First, with almost no assets, the hourly compensation is too low to bother managing the assets. Conversely, with six-figure assets, the hourly return can be substantial. Second, even when the hourly wage is substantial, asset management doesn't allow you to keep increasing your income by putting in more hours like working does. The total compensation is thus less than what could be made while working for money until assets exceed income by a factor 25 or more.</p>
