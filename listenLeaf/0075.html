    <p> Sometimes the most generative tools are the simplest: a pencil, a notebook, an observing gaze. For a young Charles Darwin, such modest equipment provided the key to developing a theory that would change the world.
In 1831 Darwin was twenty-two years old, recently graduated from Christ’s College, Cambridge, uncertain whether to pursue a conventional career as a doctor or parson—or to follow his burgeoning interest in natural history. In August of that year, he received a letter from his former tutor at Cambridge,
asking if he would be interested in serving as a naturalist on a two-year expedition aboard the HMS Beagle.</p>
    
    <p> Darwin accepted, and in December he began his seaborne apprenticeship to Captain Robert FitzRoy.
The young man carefully observed and emulated the actions of the experienced captain. Darwin had never kept a journal before coming aboard the Beagle, for example, but he began to do so under the influence of FitzRoy,
whose naval training had taught him to keep a precise record of every happening aboard the ship and every detail of its oceangoing environment. Each day,
Darwin and FitzRoy ate lunch together; following the meal, FitzRoy settled down to writing, bringing both the formal ship’s log and his personal journal up to date.</p>
    
    <p> Darwin followed suit, keeping current his own set of papers: his field notebooks, in which he recorded his immediate observations, often in the form of drawings and sketches; his scientific journal, which combined observations from his field notebooks with more integrative and theoretical musings; and his personal diary. Even when Darwin disembarked from the ship for a time,
traveling by land through South America, he endeavored to maintain the nautical custom of noting down every incident, every striking sight he encountered.
The historian of science and Harvard University professor Janet Browne has remarked upon the significance of this activity of Darwin’s: “In keeping such copious records, he learned to write easily about nature and about himself. Like FitzRoy, he taught himself to look closely at his surroundings, to make notes and measurements, and to run through a mental checklist of features that ought to be recorded, never relying entirely on memory and always writing reports soon after the event.</p>
    
    <p>” She adds, “Although this was an ordinary practice in naval affairs, it was for Darwin a basic lesson in arranging his thoughts clearly and an excellent preparation for composing logical scientific arguments that stood him in good stead for many years afterwards.” But Darwin’s careful note keeping did not simply help him learn to “arrange his thoughts clearly” and “compose logical scientific arguments.” The projection of the internal workings of his mind onto the physical space of his journal created a conceptual map he was able to follow all the way to his theory of evolution. Some twenty-five years before the publication of his epochal book The Origin of Species, the entries in the journal Darwin kept throughout his expedition moved his thinking forward, step by tentative step.</p>
    
    <p>
On October 10, 1833, for example, Darwin discovered a fossilized horse tooth on the banks of the Rio Paraná in northeastern Argentina. Alongside the tooth he found the fossilized bones of a Megatherium, a giant ground sloth. Writing in his journal, Darwin puzzled over the fact that although these fossilized remains were apparently of the same age, horses still populated the earth in great numbers,
while the Megatherium was long extinct. Eighteen months later, on April 1,
1835, Darwin came upon a “fossil forest” high in the Andes—what he described in a letter to his tutor in Cambridge as “a small wood of petrified trees.</p>
    
    <p>” Again he pondered the implications of this discovery in his journal, noting that one possible explanation for the existence of the forest was a long-ago “subsidence,” or a sinking of the land under the sea, where the trees would have become calcified by marine sediment. Darwin knew that such dramatic topographical shifts—down and then up again, to the mountainous elevation at which he encountered the fossil forest—were not endorsed by the thinking of the day,
which assumed geological stability since the time of Earth’s creation. “I must confess however that I myself cannot quite banish the idea of subsidence,
enormous as the extent of movement required assuredly is,” he confided in his journal.
Such precise and yet open-minded observations helped keep Darwin moving on a steady path toward a conclusion that now appears inevitable, but which hardly seemed so at the time.</p>
    
    <p> In 1849, at forty years of age—his voyage on the HMS Beagle behind him but the publication of The Origin of Species still to come—Darwin advised those who would follow in his footsteps to “acquire the habit of writing very copious notes, not all for publication, but as a guide for himself.” The naturalist must take “precautions to attain accuracy,” he continued, “for the imagination is apt to run riot when dealing with masses of vast dimensions and with time during almost infinity.” When thought overwhelms the mind, the mind uses the world—and researchers have reported some intriguing findings about why this use of the (physical, spatial) world is so beneficial for our thinking. As with the creation of concept maps, the process of taking notes in the field—whether that field is a sales floor, a conference room, or a high school chemistry lab—itself confers a cognitive bonus.</p>
    
    <p> When we simply watch or listen, we take it all in, imposing few distinctions on the stimuli streaming past our eyes and ears. As soon as we begin making notes, however, we are forced to discriminate, judge, and select. This more engaged mental activity leads us to process what we’re observing more deeply. It can also lead us to have new thoughts; our jottings build for us a series of ascending steps from which we can survey new vistas.</p>
