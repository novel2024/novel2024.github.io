    <p> If it was, I should have earned more than $40,000 per year after spending 10 years to acquire what corresponds to a master's degree in nuclear physics and a PhD in astrophysics, given that you can also earn this salary as a toll booth operator. Nor is it determined by any kind of inherent value. If it was,
school teachers would be paid more than professional athletes and bankers.
It's strictly determined by how much the seller can get.</p>
    
    <p> This took the economics profession hundreds of years to figure out. Since there are different sellers with different levels of knowledge about their customers,
prices vary.
When buying parts, tools, as well as new things, always try to get three different prices across markets (new and used) and time (do prices tend to go up or down? are they seasonal?) to get an idea of the effective price.
Memorize the prices for anything you buy regularly--parts for food, also known as ingredients, come to mind.</p>
    
    <p> If memory is failing, keep a price diary. Only issue "limit orders"--that is, don't buy until the price falls below some predetermined level. Patience is rewarded more often than not. Let current purchases determine what problem you're currently solving rather than the other way around; adapt your plans to what is on sale.</p>
    
    <p>
Given the price, consider whether it's worthwhile to buy the part or manufacture it yourself. This comes down to valuing your time earning or otherwise making money versus your time fixing the problem directly.
When buying products, you're paying for time, materials, and knowledge.
You probably have plenty of time (you read this far), materials (especially when bought in bulk) are shockingly inexpensive, and often the knowledge required to do a job is overestimated.</p>
    
    <p> This means that most people do not properly value their own knowledge, having been convinced that an expert must always be consulted. However, if you can add and subtract, you can do your own taxes; if you can keep an appointment, you can garden; and, if you can peel a potato and tell time, you can cook. These days there are plenty of tutorials online and in books that will teach you how. With just a little experience, the only thing that will separate your work from that of a professional is that the professional can do it five times faster than you can do it--the first time.</p>
    
    <p>
This means that anything done more than once is worth doing yourself.
To wit, I can cook my favorite food better than a restaurant because I have cooked this dish more than 100 times, while a professional chef may only make it once in a while. I can do it cheaper as well, since I work for myself for free. If I have a problem with the plumbing or a binding door, I can get immediate service because I can fix the problem myself.</p>
    
    <p> If the problem reappears, I know what the problem is and I can fix it much faster than calling a plumber or a carpenter. Once you can make things, you can also provide value to others. The greater the variety in the things you make, the greater the likelihood that you can contribute your skills.
Bodging is probably the first step in making things.</p>
    
    <p> Not to be confused with the art of botching, which is the art of screwing things up, bodging is the art of improvising a working solution using whatever is on-hand. Duct tape comes to mind. A few people seem to possess this as a natural ability,
but for the average man, bodging has been suppressed by a sea of experts and professionals. The general consensus is that now you better get an expert opinion before you engage in almost anything; better yet, just pay the expert and let him do it for you.</p>
