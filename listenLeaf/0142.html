Working for money Work has been defined in many different ways, the most appropriate being, "I know it when I see it," and very often includes activities that one does not want to do.
The best way to think of work is as a package which includes several different goals (see Contingency goal-setting), such as cash flow (see Financial cash flow cycles), contributing to society, personal edification,
socializing, having something to do all day, etc.Â (see the discussion of side effects in Contingency goal-setting). In many cases, cash flow isn't considered the primary reason to work.</p>
    
    <p> Many state meaning or passion as the main reason for working. However, even if that is the case, the cash flow to pay for stuff, which can't be otherwise acquired due to lack of skills or connections (see The lock-in and A Renaissance lifestyle), is a crucial part of work.
When cash flow comes from work, it's called earned income. Earned income is made either by working for an employer or working at a business you own, and it always requires spending time and effort.</p>
    
    <p> Earning income is therefore a process of exchanging your time for money. For example,
suppose the actuarial tables say you have 60 years left to live, and you work 1 year in exchange for $30,000 net. You now have 59 years left, but you also have $30,000 which you would not have gotten otherwise. Similarly,
you can exchange more years for more money.</p>
    
    <p> Many exchange most of their time for money. If we subtract the time spent on work plus associated tasks and sleep in a 24 hour day, there's very little time left, perhaps less than 25%.
However, money can be spent to avoid spending time directly--for example, earning $10 to buy a cast iron pan takes less time than building your own pan from scratch. Money can also be invested to get more money to spend, thus avoiding having to exchange time.</p>
    
    <p> Different arrangements define the restrictions on your time and money stream. I divide them into salaried work, which covers the typical arrangement of a salaryman (see The salary man), and nonsalaried work, which covers the typical arrangements of a working man (see The working man) or businessman (see The businessman).
Within the context of the Renaissance lifestyle (see A Renaissance lifestyle) there are three financial strategies to pursue: Intermittent work (see Intermittent work), financial independence (early retirement), or semi- retirement supported by a form of part-time work (see Financial independence and investing). The beauty of combining the Renaissance lifestyle with working for money is that as long as you can get and hold a job for a handful of years, the strategy is robust and practical in the sense that success relies more on internal qualities like focus, discipline,
persistence, and spending behavior, which are under your control, than on external circumstances like career or businesses success, or a lucky run in the real estate or stock market, which are not directly under your control.</p>
    
    <p>
Salaried and nonsalaried work feel different from each other due to the different ways time is exchanged and remunerated. Very likely you already work, so instead of starting something new, it's most convenient to keep doing whatever it is you currently do to make money, while beginning to work on ways to make yourself more economically independent and financially resilient (see A modular design).105 Salaried work Salaried work provides a very predictable money stream and typically a very predictable work schedule, involving showing up every weekday except for about 10-25 days each year.
A salary is paid when productivity is hard to measure because the effort can't be directly associated with a specific revenue-generating product or service.</p>
    
    <p> This means that productivity has little bearing on how much a person actually gets paid, salary being determined by contract negotiation skills and historical accidents, such as being hired the year before new hires are given a substantially higher starting salary. It may be that this is what has led to the widespread secrecy about what coworkers are paid. Such secrecy maintains order, because although managers may not be aware of how hard their people work, everybody knows, or rather has an opinion about how productive their coworkers really are. Piecework is often salaried because it's cheaper for an employee to train one full-time employee than it is to train two half-time employees.</p>
    
    <p> The systemic consequence is unemployment and thus competition for full-time jobs (see Job Competition), which drives salaries down. Conversely, it also creates more job security with a given employer, since hourly paid workers are the first to be laid off during downturns. Even if a salaried job does not involve piecework, it's often expected for employees to be present regardless of whether they're being productive or not. This often leads to water cooler talk for hours, pretend work, and other nonproductive activities, which many people actually enjoy.</p>
