    <p> In business and education, in public and private life,
we emphasize individual competition over joint cooperation. We resist what we consider conformity (at least in its overt, organized form), and we look with suspicion on what we call “groupthink.” In some measure, this wariness may be justified. Uncritical group thinking can lead to foolish and even disastrous decisions.</p>
    
    <p> But the limitations of excessive “cognitive individualism” are becoming increasingly clear as well. Individual cognition is simply not sufficient to meet the challenges of a world in which information is so abundant, expertise is so specialized, and issues are so complex. In this milieu, a single mind laboring on its own is at a distinct disadvantage in solving problems or generating new ideas. Something beyond solo thinking is required—the generation of a state that is entirely natural to us as a species, and yet one that has come to seem quite strange and exotic: the group mind.</p>
    
    <p>
 HOW DOES A group of minds think as one? It can seem mysterious or even magical. Indeed, the study of the group mind by Western science got off to a dubious start in this regard—a relatively recent historical interlude that, on top of our culture’s long-standing ideological commitment to individualism, helps to explain the unease with which the group mind is often regarded. The episode in question got under way in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period in which the day’s intellectuals—such as the French physician Gustave Le Bon and the British psychologist William McDougall—conceived a fascination with the way crowds of people seemed to have minds of their own.
The group mind was believed to be powerful but also dangerous: primitive,
irrational, incipiently violent.</p>
    
    <p> Significantly, it was also assumed that the group was less intelligent than the individual. Complex ideas are “only accessible to crowds after having assumed a very simple shape,” asserted Le Bon in The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, first published in 1895. “It is especially when we are dealing with somewhat lofty philosophic or scientific ideas that we see how far-reaching are the modifications they require in order to lower them to the level of the intelligence of crowds,” he wrote. McDougall sounded a similar note in The Group Mind: A Sketch of the Principles of Collective Psychology,
published in 1920.</p>
    
    <p> “Not only mobs or simple crowds, but such bodies as juries,
committees, corporations of all sorts, which are partially organized groups, are notoriously liable to pass judgments, to form decisions, to enact rules or laws, so obviously erroneous, unwise, or defective that anyone, even the least intelligent member of the group concerned, might have been expected to produce a better result,” he averred.
This conception of the group mind was hugely influential; its echoes linger today in our prevailing distrust and even disparagement of group thinking. But the field rested on shaky empirical foundations. Without a way to explain how the group mind operated, its theorists turned to vague, unscientific, and even supernatural speculation.</p>
    
    <p> Le Bon conjectured about a “magnetic influence” at work within crowds. McDougall mused about the possibility of “telepathic communication.” Even the psychoanalyst Carl Jung got into the act, advancing the notion of a shared “genetic ectoplasm” that bound a group of people as one.
Ultimately the entire field collapsed under its own imprecision and incoherence.</p>
    
    <p>
The notion of a group mind “slipped ignominiously into the history of social psychology,” writes one observer. It was “banished from the realm of respectable scientific discourse,” notes another. Social scientists took as their near exclusive focus the individual, thinking and acting on his own.
But the serious study of the group mind is now staging a surprising comeback.</p>
    
    <p>
It owes its resurgence to sheer necessity: contemporary conditions demand it.
Knowledge is more abundant; expertise is more specialized; problems are more complex. The activation of the group mind—in which factual knowledge, skilled expertise, and mental effort are distributed across multiple individuals—is the only adequate response to these developments. As group thinking has become more imperative, interest has grown in learning how to do it well.</p>
