    <p> If appliances are to be replaced, the absolute power consumption is more important than the relative consumption. By changing your eating habits from refrigerated and frozen food to a diet of fresh food and staples, you'll be able to get away with a much smaller refrigerator. I can keep my leftovers in a dorm-sized refrigerator. When I have lived in places with larger refrigerators, they have always been mostly empty.</p>
    
    <p> Save a few bucks by filling them with water containers instead. Large refrigerators are mainly filled with "condiments and compost"--that is, a large assortment of ketchup, mayonnaise, hot sauce, and stuff you're not going to eat anyway. Keep in mind that people have been conditioned to store everything in refrigerators, even things that don't really need cooling.
Reading sailing and cruising manuals can be very helpful if you plan to store food for weeks on end.</p>
    
    <p> I find it easier just to live close to a supermarket and drop in when I'm out.
With that in mind, you may decide to go refrigerator-less. You wouldn't be the first. You'll likely be amazed at how silent your home will be without the droning compressor.</p>
    
    <p> While a refrigerator is a suboptimal strategy, a large chest freezer may be a worthwhile investment. The reason is that you can stock up on sales. Again, though, if you let your meals be dictated by sales, you can forgo the freezer.
In terms of appliances, consider whether electric is appropriate (see Appropriate response).</p>
    
    <p> Unless you use the gadget more than one hour per week, it most likely is not. With a little research, it's often possible to find a "manual" version. Hand drills, grinders, mortar and pestle, wheat grinders,
etc.--in short, most household tools--come in some pre-electric version.</p>
    
    <p>
This "primitive" version is often better built and will last a lifetime--that is,
your lifetime, not the lifetime of the product--a warranty that never made any sense to me. Be prepared for sticker shock, though. This kind of quality has a large upfront cost.
A synergistic side effect of the manual version is that it requires human power, which burns calories (see Moving), generates heat (see Heating and cooling), and provides a closer connection to the work.</p>
    
    <p> Indeed, kneading dough can be done with the hands; it doesn't require a stand mixer, unless you're baking twice a day.
Heating and cooling The central heating which everybody in the Western world takes for granted is a strange concept to other cultures. Central heating has conditioned us to fairly tight tolerance ranges. However, it's possible to change your body to feeling quite comfortable while sitting in a t-shirt at 15C (59F) or, alternatively, deal with 30C (86F) (see A modular design).</p>
    
    <p>
How warm or cold you feel depends on metabolism, circulation, diet,
activity, clothing, and environment.74 If you've ever relocated from a cold climate to a warm climate, you've probably been surprised at how quickly you adapt. What used to be a balmy 10C (50F) outside is now freezing cold.
Feeling warm or cold has a lot to do with adaptation.</p>
