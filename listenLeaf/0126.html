Walking To a large extent, weather is all about attitude and the right clothes and shoes. I grew up in a place where it probably rains 200 days a year, and consequently I have more than a handful of different words for different types of rain. Conversely, a few raindrops in a dry area send people scrambling for cover. Similarly, one inch of snow in a place where it never snows sends cars careening all over the place.</p>
    
    <p> Getting caught in the rain is really like a bear attack. Don't run! The reason is that due to aberration,
running will cause the rain to come in from the front, thus exposing a much larger area of the body. If you walk, it'll mostly come from above, and only the shoulders and the head will get wet. If it's not windy, use an umbrella.</p>
    
    <p> It might be unhandy or uncool, but not even the best `tex-materials can beat an umbrella for breathability in this situation. Don't get one of those fashionably huge umbrellas. For handiness, the smaller the better. For instance, I can fit my telescopic $5 umbrella in my chest pocket.</p>
    
    <p> Even without an umbrella, it's possible to walk for about an hour and only get the top part of the jacket and maybe the shins of the pants wet.
If it's rainy and windy, the problem becomes more difficult. The umbrella is now useless: if deployed, it'll blow out shortly. `Tex shell jackets are great.</p>
    
    <p> I prefer the three-layer type which comprise a liner, a `tex barrier, and the outer shell, which is typically treated with water repellent.
The two-layer jackets are slightly lighter, slightly more expensive, and, I suspect, slightly less durable. They use a special treatment on the `tex layer so that it doesn't need to be protected by a liner. I got my jacket about 14 years ago for around $400 or $500 and it was completely worth it, being presently amortized to about $40/year.</p>
    
    <p> Having an absolutely windproof and breathable jacket feels much better than an insulated nylon jacket. If the outer shell is waterproofed, it's sufficiently water resistant to take a shower with. If it's not, water in the soaked shell will slowly diffuse "around the corner" at the sleeves and creep up on the inside. Also, the `tex will no longer be breathing, although it's still practically waterproof.</p>
    
    <p> I picked an all- black jacket, because it works better for business casual than signal colors-- if that is not of concern to you, I would advise offshore foul weather gear because of its superior hood and collar. Two things to consider: First, a big hood--check to see if it holds a bike helmet; a jacket designed for military use likely will--and preferably one that folds into the collar to retain the business casual feel. Most hoods on cheaper jackets are so small that buckling up means having the hood directly on your skin. A good hood should have the appearance of a small astronaut helmet.</p>
    
    <p> Large pockets are great. I can carry one umbrella, two bananas, a large pair of gloves, or a handheld 2-meter transceiver in my inside pocket. It's huge. It also has a drawstring to adjust the waist and the bottom.</p>
