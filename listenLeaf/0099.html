    <p> We currently spend $237/person/month.
The idea is therefore to seriously consider whether your current living arrangements are optimally aligned with your liberty and pursuit of happiness. Is your money best spent on an extra bedroom or five years of freedom? If not aligned, doing so should be of primary importance. Unless you revel in interior decorating--and if so, why not decorate other people's homes and get paid for it?--home maintenance and repair or cleaning, most activities don't require a large home.</p>
    
    <p> Resources like money and time spent earning money may therefore be better spent on activities you enjoy, rather than things you possess. Even if you like "entertaining", you could simply rent a restaurant the few times a month or year that you do. If you do it more often, open a bed and breakfast, or consider expanding the realm of entertainment beyond eating.
Sleeping and other living arrangements The taxman defines a home as a place to sleep and a place to cook, with bathroom facilities.</p>
    
    <p> This leaves wide room for interpretation,69 but what's important is not the "rooms" but the utility (see Building blocks) that must be acquired. Instead of thinking in nouns like bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, think in verbs: sleeping, eating, washing, etc.
Make a list of activities (verbs) that you need to do--sleeping, eating,
washing up--and what you want to do--writing, hiking, cycling,
entertaining, working, skating, talking, cooking, playing, exercising, etc.
Now consider whether you do some of these activities often enough to have "in-home" facilities or whether you're better off outsourcing them.</p>
    
    <p> Consider this list and extend it to your general facilities--for example, how long since you last used the guest room, the bar room, the home cinema room, etc.
Consider that some rooms could have multiple uses (see Monouse and Multiuse). In particular, are the facilities available nearby already? In this case, there's really no reason to duplicate them at home. For instance, if you're a gym rat and spend six days a week at the gym, maybe you can shower there and thus don't need elaborate bathroom facilities at home.</p>
    
    <p> If you eat in cafeterias most of the time, maybe you don't need anything fancier than a microwave and a minirefrigerator for your in-home kitchen facilities. Hence, if you currently have rooms and facilities that mostly go unused or could go unused with a change of habit or hobby to something that requires less stuff on location, yet provides as much enjoyment, don't include them in your next home.
Living A place to sleep can be provided by couch surfing, a ship berth, a tube- hotel, a military cot, a tent, airports (for the perma-travelers), a houseboat, a yacht, a yurt, a car, a van, a motorhome, a truck, a room, etc. Some jobs,
like long-haul trucking, serving in the military, caretaking, housesitting, and commercial fishing, include some form of shelter.</p>
    
    <p>Note that some of these choices lend themselves more to renting than others. For instance, it's hard to buy a room in a house, yet it's usually possible to rent one. Conversely,
it's easier to buy a yacht than to rent one as a liveaboard. You should choose your living arrangements to be somewhat compatible with your interests.</p>
    
    <p> If you like other people, go for the shared living, dorms, or communes. Do you like the sea? Go for the boats. How about the road? Do you like to feel you're getting away with something? Check out stealth/van/city-camping-- some chain stores will allow overnight parking; some national parks allow longer stays, all for free. Are you handy? Consider owning something older or building your own.</p>
    
    <p> Are you responsible? Consider caretaking. Do you want minimum hassle? How about renting a furnished room from a landlord? Do you want maximum hassle? Buy an apartment complex, live in one of the units, and rent out the additional units. Searching the Internet for any of the terms above should lead to people interested in one or another way of living. They do exist.</p>
