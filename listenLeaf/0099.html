    <p> Reasoning is a social activity, in other words, and should be practiced as such.
Mercier’s and Sperber’s premise, which they advanced in their 2017 book The Enigma of Reason, makes coherent sense of the very aspects of human thought that have seemed so confounding: the fact that people are capable of stringently evaluating the validity of arguments, along with the fact that they so often fail to do so when the arguments are their own. Both tendencies are fully predicted by the authors’ “argumentative theory of reasoning.” We have every incentive to closely examine the arguments of others—who might be out to exploit or manipulate us for their own ends—but few inducements to scrutinize the arguments we make ourselves.</p>
    
    <p> After all, being completely convinced of the merits of our case can only make us more credible to others. And expending a lot of effort on picking apart our own argument isn’t necessary, not when we can rely on our sparring partner to conduct the audit for us.
The argumentative theory also makes specific predictions about the conditions in which reason will function best, such as: the weaknesses of our reasoning faculty will be most evident when we use it outside the context in which it evolved. That context is raucously, noisily social.</p>
    
    <p> When we reason alone, inside our own heads, we will be dangerously vulnerable to confirmation bias— constructing the strongest case for our own point of view, and fooling ourselves in the process. Of course, in our brainbound culture, thinking alone is how thinking is usually done, with predictably disappointing results. Mercier and Sperber urge a different approach: arguing together, with the aim of arriving jointly at something close to the truth.
Arguing together is something Brad Bird and his frequent collaborator John Walker have turned into an art form.</p>
    
    <p> Bird is the Academy Award–winning director of Pixar movies like Ratatouille and The Incredibles; Walker is the producer who helped to manage the making of these and other films. The two are “famous for fighting openly,” Bird has acknowledged, “because he’s got to get it done and I’ve got to make it as good as it can be before it gets done.” Some of the arguments they had while creating The Incredibles were so epic that they made it into the bonus materials included on the movie’s DVD. “Look, I’m just trying to get us across the line,” yells Walker in one moment captured by the camera.</p>
    
    <p> Bird hollers back, “I’m trying to get us across the line in first place!” In an interview that took place after the movie’s release, Bird explained that he counts on Walker to push back against the arguments he makes, saying of his producer: “I don’t want him to tell me, ‘Whatever you want, Brad’ . . . I love working with John because he’ll give me the bad news straight to my face.</p>
    
    <p>
Ultimately, we both win. If you ask within Pixar, we are known as being efficient. Our movies aren’t cheap, but the money gets on the screen because we’re open in our conflict.” Stanford University business school professor Robert Sutton conducted the interview with Bird, whom he calls “a vigorous practitioner of creative abrasion.</p>
    
    <p>” Bird is on the right track with his approach, says Sutton: “A pile of studies show that when people fight over ideas, and do so with mutual respect,
they are more productive and creative.” Indeed, research has consistently found that argument—when conducted in the right way—produces deeper learning,
sounder decisions, and more innovative solutions (not to mention better movies).
Why does arguing help us think better? Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber have their theory: Engaging in active debate puts us in the position of evaluating others’ arguments, not simply constructing (and promoting) our own. Such objective analysis, unclouded by self-interested confirmation bias, makes the most of humans’ discriminating intelligence.</p>
    
    <p> But there are additional reasons why confrontations enhance our cognition, reasons that are likewise rooted deep in human nature.
For example, there’s the simple fact that conflict irresistibly seizes our attention and motivates us to learn more. We would probably put down a novel or switch off a movie that didn’t introduce conflict early on—whether that conflict centers on a resolute hero battling the odds, two lovers separated by fate,
or a looming disaster that might yet be averted. The drama inherent in conflict is what keeps us reading or watching.</p>
