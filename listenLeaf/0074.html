    <p> Thus, it can be tremendously liberating not to "need" something to be happy.
Since humans need very little, eliminating various wants can go far in terms of solving problems. Can't afford it? Don't want it! Too complicated?
Don't want it! Reduce and simplify. Reduce and simplify! An entire aesthetic can and has been formed around this principle, and so the pleasure from following this path can be as strong as the (previous) pleasure of accumulation.</p>
    
    <p> However, as there's a point of diminishing returns to the pleasure of accumulation, there's also a point of diminishing returns to the pleasure of giving things up. The optimal point is somewhere in the middle.
It should therefore be kept in mind that while eliminating problems can be a very good tool, some will be very tempted to make it their only tool, in which case it becomes a hammer for which the whole world becomes a nail.
Once you've developed a greater freedom to choose by changing some "needs" into "wants," you can tailor your wants to areas that are supplied freely or at least inexpensively.</p>
    
    <p> Much free or almost free stuff comes from the tremendous amount of waste generated by a culture where things are being bought, used once, and then put away in attics, garages, extra bedrooms, and ultimately the landfill. Methods for getting things for free are social in nature, relying on connections to others (these days often on the Internet with like-minded people), keeping track of who has or needs what, and making the connections, either through donations, swapping,
bartering, or lending. Getting and providing things for free provides value to society insofar as it keeps things out of the landfill and reduces the sales price of newly produced things. Providing things for free provides value insofar as it prevents further consumption of finite resources and maximizes the use of our productive efforts.</p>

It's somewhat likely that you're only going to use a given item a few times yourself too. Sending it along, thus instituting a kind of serial ownership, maximizes its total use. Serial ownership creates a form of decentralized library. While there are websites which bring serial owners together, availability is limited since people are free to keep things as long as they wish, and many do keep their things around, "just in case.</p>
    
    <p>" Serial ownership can easily be developed as an attitude simply by selling things once they're no longer in use. To minimize depreciation costs, buy and sell used. The total cost of ownership will be minimal. Often things go out of use because they break and the owner doesn't know how to fix them.</p>
    
    <p> Such things can frequently be acquired very cheaply or for free. Sadly, they're often thrown out immediately, so if you're looking for broken things to rescue, you must be vigilant. Often, these things are easily fixable--bicycles with loose brakes and flat tires, lawn mowers with dirty spark plugs,
furniture with loose screws--and a person with a few simple repair skills can fix them. Repairing many things is surprisingly easy.</p>
    
    <p> Most mechanical items are put together with nuts and bolts and only require a set of the right wrenches or screwdrivers. Beginners should at the very least be able to replace a broken part. The trick is to find out which part is broken, but keep using the replacement method and you will find the right part.
If you get your networking and repair skills down, you'll find yourself buying mostly the missing parts for your solutions and tools to fit them in-- buy tools that last a lifetime and this phase will soon be over.</p>
    
    <p> After all, any finished product can usually be had for free. The most important thing to remember is that the price of anything is not determined by how much effort went into the production. If it was, I should be paid as much for writing this book as an actor gets for a movie. Nor does it depend on the level of specialized knowledge required for the job.</p>
