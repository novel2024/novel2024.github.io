    <p> Definition--that is, the visibility of muscles under the skin,
usually achieved through a combination of diet and exercise before a contest or a photo shoot, suggests that muscles are larger than they actually are. Tanned skin enhances contrast and shadows, further enhancing the effect.
(85) The reason is that a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and by isolating muscles, stabilizer muscles remain underworked and thus they'll limit the weight that can be lifted without sitting down or pulling/pushing in a particular direction. In real life, you rarely get to lie under the weight and get a good wide grip with both hands on a thin bar.</p>

(86) Use lots of tape and double bag the sand.
(87) For weight loss it's much more important to consider total calories burned versus total calories eaten. It's much better to burn 300kcal in a high-intensity workout than it is to burn 250kcal in a low-intensity workout. The latter will burn a greater fraction of fat during the exercise, but there will be 50kcal left on the table.</p>

(88) It is quite sad to realize that we have become so sedentary that most of us are far from this goal. For example, looking in an old school strength training manual, I found that being able to press your own bodyweight to an overhead position was merely considered "good," and that a "man-building" exercise constituted 10 clean and jerk repetitions with two 80-pound dumbbells. Many modern gyms don't offer free weights above 50 pounds because doing so would apparently contradict the "family-friendly" image they want to promote.
(89) Push-ups are a rather poor measure of overall performance, although one can certainly do far worse; for push-ups, this is roughly equivalent to doing 115 push ups in the alloted time.</p>
    
    <p>
(90) There are a lot of exercise myths. First, you can make a muscle larger and/or stronger or smaller and/or weaker. You can't make it longer or otherwise change its shape without surgery. Toning refers to the state of your muscle contraction.</p>
    
    <p> When couch potatoes exercise, their muscles initially tend to tighten up. This state of bliss lasts a couple of weeks unless the intensity is continuously stepped up; and you can't keep doing this. Unfortunately, toning is often confused with definition, that is, the ability to see muscles under the fat and skin.
This leads to the spot reduction myth.</p>
    
    <p> Just as it is impossible to lengthen a muscle unless you undergo surgery, you can't spot reduce without surgery. The body uses the most easy-to-get fat first--typically the fat on the face, forearms, and calves; and the stubborn fat last-- typically on the belly and hips (love handles). All you can do is reduce overall fat.
(91) This is the reason restaurants serve high-glycemic foods like bread or tortillas and then make you wait a long time to order, in the hopes that you have developed a sense of hunger or, more euphemistically,
worked up an appetite.</p>
