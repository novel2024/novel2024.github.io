    <p> I have therefore written the book as a textbook.
Learning how to become financially independent requires study. This requires effort and is not easy--if it was truly easy, everybody would be doing it--but it's no more difficult than getting a college education or becoming a skilled tradesman in your respective field. What I'll describe here is another kind of life, the life of an independently wealthy and widely skilled person--a modern Renaissance man.</p>

A note about the difficulty level This isn't a book for beginners. It's not a book one can pick up, read, and proceed to become financially independent just as reading a textbook about physics won't turn a person into a physicist. This only happens when the concepts are constantly applied and one starts "thinking like a physicist." Things are similar for a person pursuing financial independence.</p>

This is a book which I think can be read at several different levels. The reason for different levels is that people change as they learn. Depending on where you are, the book will relate to you in different ways. This is good,
because those who evolve will become different people, eventually.</p>
    
    <p> What used to seem like a sacrifice will seem natural, and what used to seem natural will come to be seen as a sacrifice. What used to be a collection of techniques will become a general principle. What used to feel challenging will now feel easy.
A note about getting started You don't need to learn everything before getting started.</p>
    
    <p> After all, you can drive a car without knowing how the engine works. In fact, you can drive several different kinds of cars. This is because most cars handle the same. However, to stay with the analogy, the same car can be driven with very different gas mileages.</p>
    
    <p> It may be listed as 33mpg, but good technique can double that number and poor technique can cut it in half. A trivial technique is to reduce speed by 5mph, which will simply bring most drivers back to the speed limit. Similarly, if living is thought of as driving a particular kind of "vehicle," there are techniques in this book which can be applied without understanding exactly why they work. Understanding why they work will subsequently allow one to tweak and improve them.</p>
    
    <p>
A note about references This is not an academic work. I have resisted the temptation to follow the medievally inspired academic tradition of citing old books to make statements based on authority.2 I find that showing the derivation from basic principles is more useful for application. Instead of references, I have provided a bibliography of books in the appendix of this book, each of which will add to the subject.</p>

A note about geography While this book is somewhat US-centric in its examples, the methods should work in any developed country with a market economy. Retirement plans have different names from country to country, but every country offers very similar plans to its citizens. In some countries health care is paid through taxes, and in other countries it's paid out of pocket. In any case the prices for goods and services are similar in developed countries so the strategies in this book will work, even if technical details differ.</p>
