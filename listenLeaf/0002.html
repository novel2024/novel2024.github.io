    <p> In today’s world, where physical boundaries have been obliterated by the Internet and numerous other technologies, you are at an even greater risk of being preyed upon by other humans. Not only are you being preyed on by the people you interact within the physical world, but there is also the additional threat of virtual predators. Suffice to say, humans have become even more predatorial than wild animals.
Most people would rather believe the best of everyone they meet until proven otherwise.</p>
    
    <p> Think about it. When you meet a new person, do you often think of them as a good person or a bad person? High chances are,
you want to hope everyone has as kind a heart as you do. That they would never do anything to harm you or another. If you go through life believing that everyone is as good as you are (assuming that you are indeed a good person), you are at a very high risk of getting manipulated and taken advantage of.</p>
    
    <p>
Let’s back up a little.
When a human being is born, they are born with some inherent qualities that are critical for their survival. For instance, a baby is born with the ability to cry in order to get their needs met by another person. This is because the baby indeed needs another person to cater to them because they are too little to get anything done on their own.</p>
    
    <p> As such, a baby will cry when it needs to be fed, cry when it needs to sleep, cry when it needs comfort...cry for just about anything.</p>
    
    <p> Nobody trained this baby to cry--it is a survival tool it came with straight from the womb. If the parents of this baby do not set particular boundaries as far as responding to the baby’s requests, the baby learns that it can get just about anything by crying. This is how manipulation begins. That is not to mean that parents are solely responsible for the breeding of manipulators.</p>
    
    <p> While parents contribute to the development of manipulative behavior by virtue of genetics and the kind of nurturing, or lack thereof, provided to offspring, there are other factors at play. At the very core of our being, we are selfish beings. We want the best for ourselves first, and others later. For some people, there is a line as to what extent they are willing to go to get the best for themselves.</p>
    
    <p>
For others, the line is blurry and sometimes even non-existent. Where the line is blurry or does not exist is where dark psychology begins.
Dark psychology in the simplest terms is the study of predatory human behavior. In other words, dark psychology explores humans as they prey on other humans for their own benefit.</p>
    
    <p> It dives into the much darker side of human consciousness, where conscience, empathy, and selflessness are unheard of. Dark Psychology seeks to understand why some humans do not seem to have any qualms about causing others harm as long as they stand to gain something from it. Dark psychology acknowledges that not everyone is a nice person, however inclined you may be to think so, and then tries to answer why that may be the case.
Human predatory behavior is something that has been in existence since the beginning of time.</p>
