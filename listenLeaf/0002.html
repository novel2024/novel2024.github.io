    <p> This book argues otherwise: it holds that the mind is something more like the nest-building bird I spotted on my walk, plucking a bit of string here, a twig there, constructing a whole out of available parts. For humans these parts include, most notably, the feelings and movements of our bodies; the physical spaces in which we learn and work; and the other minds with which we interact—our classmates, colleagues, teachers, supervisors,
friends. Sometimes all three elements come together in especially felicitous fashion, as they did for the brilliant intellectual team of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. The two psychologists carried out much of their groundbreaking work on heuristics and biases—the human mind’s habitual shortcuts and distortions—by talking and walking together, through the bustling streets of Jerusalem or along the rolling hills of the California coast.</p>
    
    <p> “I did the best thinking of my life on leisurely walks with Amos,” Kahneman has said.
Many tomes have been written on human cognition, many theories proposed and studies conducted (Tversky and Kahneman’s among them). These efforts have produced countless illuminating insights, but they are limited by their assumption that thinking happens only inside the brain. Much less attention has been paid to the ways people use the world to think: the gestures of the hands,
the space of a sketchbook, the act of listening to someone tell a story, or the task of teaching someone else.</p>
    
    <p> These “extra-neural” inputs change the way we think;
it could even be said that they constitute a part of the thinking process itself. But where is the chronicle of this mode of cognition? Our scientific journals mostly proceed from the premise that the mental organ is a disembodied, placeless,
asocial entity, a “brain in a vat”; our history books spin tales that attribute world- changing breakthroughs to individual men, thinking great thoughts on their own.
Yet a parallel narrative has existed in front of us all along—a kind of secret history of thinking outside the brain. Scientists, artists, authors; leaders,
inventors, entrepreneurs: they’ve all used the world as raw material for their trains of thought.</p>
    
    <p> This book aims to exhume that hidden saga, reclaiming its rightful place in any full accounting of how the human race has achieved its remarkable feats of intellect and creativity.
We’ll learn about how geneticist Barbara McClintock made her Nobel Prize– winning discoveries by imaginatively “embodying” the plant chromosomes she studied, and about how pioneering psychotherapist and social critic Susie Orbach senses what her patients are feeling by tuning in to the internal sensations of her own body (a capacity known as interoception). We’ll contemplate how biologist James Watson determined the double-helix structure of DNA by physically manipulating cardboard cutouts he’d made himself, and how author Robert Caro plots the lives of his biographical subjects on an intricately detailed wall-sized map. We’ll explore how virologist Jonas Salk was inspired to complete his work on a polio vaccine while wandering a thirteenth- century Italian monastery, and how the artist Jackson Pollock set off a revolution in painting by trading his apartment in frenetic downtown Manhattan for a farmhouse on the verdant south fork of Long Island.</p>
    
    <p> We’ll find out how Pixar director Brad Bird creates modern movie classics like Ratatouille and The Incredibles by arguing—vehemently—with his longtime producer, and how physicist Carl Wieman, another Nobel Prize winner, figured out that inducing his students to talk with one another was the key to getting them to think like scientists.
Such stories push back against the prevailing assumption that the brain can, or should, do it all on its own; they are vivid testimony to the countervailing notion that we think best when we think with our bodies, our spaces, and our relationships. But as with Friedrich Nietzsche’s commendation of the virtues of walking, the evidence supporting the efficacy of thinking outside the brain is far from merely anecdotal. Research emerging from three related areas of investigation has convincingly demonstrated the centrality of extra-neural resources to our thinking processes.</p>

First, there is the study of embodied cognition, which explores the role of the body in our thinking: for example, how making hand gestures increases the fluency of our speech and deepens our understanding of abstract concepts.
Second, there is the study of situated cognition, which examines the influence of place on our thinking: for instance, how environmental cues that convey a sense of belonging, or a sense of personal control, enhance our performance in that space. And third, there is the study of distributed cognition, which probes the effects of thinking with others—such as how people working in groups can coordinate their individual areas of expertise (a process called “transactive memory”), and how groups can work together to produce results that exceed their members’ individual contributions (a phenomenon known as “collective intelligence”).
As a journalist who has covered research in psychology and cognitive science for more than twenty years, I read the findings generated by these fields with growing excitement.</p>
    
    <p> Together they seemed to indicate that it’s the stuff outside our heads that makes us smart—a proposition with enormous implications for what we do in education, in the workplace, and in our everyday lives. The only problem: there was no “together,” no overarching framework that organized these multitudinous results into a coherent whole. Researchers working within these three disciplines published in different journals and presented at different conferences, rarely drawing connections among their areas of specialization.
Was there some unifying idea that could pull together these deeply intriguing findings?
Once again a philosopher came to my rescue: this time it was Andy Clark,
professor of cognitive philosophy at the University of Sussex in England.</p>
    
    <p> In 1995 Clark had co-written a paper titled “The Extended Mind,” which opened with a deceptively simple question: “Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?” Clark and his coauthor, philosopher David Chalmers, noted that we have traditionally assumed that the mind is contained within the head— but, they argued, “there is nothing sacred about skull and skin.” Elements of the world outside may effectively act as mental “extensions,” allowing us to think in ways our brains could not manage on their own.
Clark and Chalmers initially focused their analysis on the way technology can extend the mind—a proposal that quickly made the leap from risibly preposterous to self-evidently obvious, once their readers acquired smartphones and began offloading large chunks of their memories onto their new devices.
(Fellow philosopher Ned Block likes to say that Clark and Chalmers’s thesis was false when it was written in 1998 but subsequently became true—perhaps in 2007, when Apple introduced the first iPhone.</p>
