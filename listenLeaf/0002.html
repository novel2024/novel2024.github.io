    <p> These “extra-neural” inputs change the way we think;it could even be said that they constitute a part of the thinking process itself. Butwhere is the chronicle of this mode of cognition? Our scientific journals mostlyproceed from the premise that the mental organ is a disembodied, placeless,asocial entity, a “brain in a vat”; our history books spin tales that attribute world-changing breakthroughs to individual men, thinking great thoughts on their own.Yet a parallel narrative has existed in front of us all along—a kind of secrethistory of thinking outside the brain. Scientists, artists, authors; leaders,inventors, entrepreneurs: they’ve all used the world as raw material for theirtrains of thought.</p>
    
    <p> This book aims to exhume that hidden saga, reclaiming itsrightful place in any full accounting of how the human race has achieved itsremarkable feats of intellect and creativity.We’ll learn about how geneticist Barbara McClintock made her Nobel Prize–winning discoveries by imaginatively “embodying” the plant chromosomes shestudied, and about how pioneering psychotherapist and social critic SusieOrbach senses what her patients are feeling by tuning in to the internalsensations of her own body (a capacity known as interoception). We’llcontemplate how biologist James Watson determined the double-helix structureof DNA by physically manipulating cardboard cutouts he’d made himself, andhow author Robert Caro plots the lives of his biographical subjects on anintricately detailed wall-sized map. We’ll explore how virologist Jonas Salk wasinspired to complete his work on a polio vaccine while wandering a thirteenth-century Italian monastery, and how the artist Jackson Pollock set off a revolutionin painting by trading his apartment in frenetic downtown Manhattan for afarmhouse on the verdant south fork of Long Island.</p>
    
    <p> We’ll find out how Pixardirector Brad Bird creates modern movie classics like Ratatouille and TheIncredibles by arguing—vehemently—with his longtime producer, and howphysicist Carl Wieman, another Nobel Prize winner, figured out that inducinghis students to talk with one another was the key to getting them to think likescientists.Such stories push back against the prevailing assumption that the brain can, orshould, do it all on its own; they are vivid testimony to the countervailing notionthat we think best when we think with our bodies, our spaces, and ourrelationships. But as with Friedrich Nietzsche’s commendation of the virtues ofwalking, the evidence supporting the efficacy of thinking outside the brain is farfrom merely anecdotal. Research emerging from three related areas ofinvestigation has convincingly demonstrated the centrality of extra-neuralresources to our thinking processes.</p>
    
    <p>First, there is the study of embodied cognition, which explores the role of thebody in our thinking: for example, how making hand gestures increases thefluency of our speech and deepens our understanding of abstract concepts.Second, there is the study of situated cognition, which examines the influence ofplace on our thinking: for instance, how environmental cues that convey a senseof belonging, or a sense of personal control, enhance our performance in thatspace. And third, there is the study of distributed cognition, which probes theeffects of thinking with others—such as how people working in groups cancoordinate their individual areas of expertise (a process called “transactivememory”), and how groups can work together to produce results that exceedtheir members’ individual contributions (a phenomenon known as “collectiveintelligence”).As a journalist who has covered research in psychology and cognitive sciencefor more than twenty years, I read the findings generated by these fields withgrowing excitement.</p>
    
    <p> Together they seemed to indicate that it’s the stuff outsideour heads that makes us smart—a proposition with enormous implications forwhat we do in education, in the workplace, and in our everyday lives. The onlyproblem: there was no “together,” no overarching framework that organizedthese multitudinous results into a coherent whole. Researchers working withinthese three disciplines published in different journals and presented at differentconferences, rarely drawing connections among their areas of specialization.Was there some unifying idea that could pull together these deeply intriguingfindings?Once again a philosopher came to my rescue: this time it was Andy Clark,professor of cognitive philosophy at the University of Sussex in England.</p>
    
    <p> In1995 Clark had co-written a paper titled “The Extended Mind,” which openedwith a deceptively simple question: “Where does the mind stop and the rest ofthe world begin?” Clark and his coauthor, philosopher David Chalmers, notedthat we have traditionally assumed that the mind is contained within the head—but, they argued, “there is nothing sacred about skull and skin.” Elements of theworld outside may effectively act as mental “extensions,” allowing us to think inways our brains could not manage on their own.Clark and Chalmers initially focused their analysis on the way technology canextend the mind—a proposal that quickly made the leap from risiblypreposterous to self-evidently obvious, once their readers acquired smartphonesand began offloading large chunks of their memories onto their new devices.(Fellow philosopher Ned Block likes to say that Clark and Chalmers’s thesis wasfalse when it was written in 1998 but subsequently became true—perhaps in2007, when Apple introduced the first iPhone.</p>
    
    <p>)Yet as early as that original paper, Clark hinted that other kinds of extensionswere possible. “What about socially extended cognition?” he and Chalmersasked. “Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of otherthinkers? We see no reason why not.” In the years that followed, Clarkcontinued to enlarge his conception of the kinds of entities that could serve asextensions of the mind.</p>
    
    <p> He observed that our physical movements and gesturesplay “an important role in an extended neural-bodily cognitive economy”; henoted that humans are inclined to create “designer environments”—carefullyappointed spaces “that alter and simplify the computational tasks which ourbrains must perform in order to solve complex problems.” Over the course ofmany more published papers and books, Clark mounted a broad and persuasiveargument against what he called the “brainbound” perspective—the view thatthinking happens only inside the brain—and in favor of what he called the“extended” perspective, in which the rich resources of our world can and doenter into our trains of thought.Consider me a convert. The notion of the extended mind seized myimagination and has not yet released its grip.</p>
    
    <p> During my many years ofreporting, I had never before encountered an idea that changed so much abouthow I think, how I work, how I parent, how I navigate everyday life. It becameapparent to me that Andy Clark’s bold proposal was not (or not only!) theesoteric thought experiment of an ivory tower philosopher; it was a plainlypractical invitation to think differently and better. As I began to catalog thedozens of techniques for thinking outside the brain that researchers have testedand verified, I eagerly incorporated them into my own repertoire.These include methods for sharpening our interoceptive sense, so as to usethese internal signals to guide our decisions and manage our mental processes;they encompass guidelines for the use of specific types of gesture, or particularmodes of physical activity, to enhance our memory and attention.</p>
    
    <p> This researchoffers instructions on using time in nature to restore our focus and increase ourcreativity, as well as directions for designing our learning and working spacesfor greater productivity and performance. The studies we’ll cover describestructured forms of social interaction that allow other people’s cognition toaugment our own; they also supply guidance on how to offload, externalize, anddynamically interact with our thoughts—a much more effective approach thandoing it all “in our heads.”In time I came to recognize that I was acquiring a second education—one thatis increasingly essential but almost always overlooked in our focus on educatingthe brain. Over many years of elementary school, high school, and even collegeand graduate school, we’re never explicitly taught to think outside the brain;we’re not shown how to employ our bodies and spaces and relationships in theservice of intelligent thought.</p>
