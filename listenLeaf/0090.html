    <p> Only you will know which one fits you better.
However, a slower process allows more maneuvering space. Rather than just putting things into storage, things can be thrown out, given away,
exchanged, swapped, or sold. With the Internet, this is much easier to facilitate.</p>
    
    <p> In my experience, the question of whether to give, trade, or sell depends on the value of the item. If the item has no use value whatsoever, it should probably be thrown out or recycled for parts. Fortunately, consumer society has a very good service level when it comes to throwing things out.
In principle, you could throw everything in a dumpster.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, some people do this--other people live off this bounty through dumpster diving.
Giving away If things have some use value but a price close to zero, such as old clothes, garden hoses, or a rusty but working bicycle, they can be given away. There are several systems for this, depending on where you live. One can donate the things to thrift stores, charities, or religious institutions,
which may be tax-deductible.</p>
    
    <p> One can put them out on the sidewalk with a sign saying "FREE." The method I like best, though, is freecycling.
Freecycling is organized through an Internet mailing list. People post things they have and things they want, and others respond.</p>
    
    <p> Once a connection has been made, the owner/donor simply puts the thing outside the front door and tells the recipient where to pick it up.
When giving things away, consider city-city or even state-state arbitrage of goods between areas with high and low costs of living. It may be helpful to transport it to a cheaper place, which may be the next, smaller city. Here the recipients may gratefully accept your $125 used chair, whereas in the "expensive" city they may be dealing in $250 chairs and scoff at your $125 chair.</p>
    
    <p>
Selling If the value is higher, things can be sold. Everything I own is for sale,
always. Ask me and I will give you a quote. Not only does this constantly remind me of the value of my possessions, but it prevents me from developing an attachment to the thing in question.</p>
    
    <p> A more enlightened state would be to always be willing to give away everything I own.
Unfortunately, I'm not sufficiently skillful, nor do I as yet own so little to easily be able to reacquire and recreate everything I own, but that would be something to strive for.
To sell things, I use online services exclusively. Online services like Craig's List are useful for common and generic items like furniture, garden tools, bicycles, toys, etc.</p>
    
    <p> Listing is free and the transaction is cash-based and hassle-free.
For odd things that can be mailed, online auctions and marketplaces offer a wider audience. Many will offer a number of free listings each month, so take advantage of that. I usually pick a price point near the bottom to ensure a quick sale.</p>
