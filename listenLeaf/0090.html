    <p> (Think of George W. Bush’s prominent ears, or Bill Clinton’s bulbous nose, or the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s oversized glasses.) Experts can leverage the caricature advantage by playing up the unique features that differentiate among a group of examples—examples that, to a novice, may come off as confusingly similar.
A third difference between experts and novices lies in the way they categorize what they see: novices sort the entities they encounter according to their superficial features, while experts classify them according to their deep function.</p>
    
    <p>
A classic experiment by Arizona State University professor Michelene Chi asked eight experts (advanced PhD students from a university physics department) and eight novices (undergraduates who had taken a single semester of physics) to sort two dozen physics problems, each one described on an index card, into categories of their choosing. The classifications devised by the two groups could not have been more different. The undergraduates sorted the problems according to their surface features: whether the problems involved springs, or pulleys, or inclined planes. The graduate students, meanwhile, categorized the problems on the basis of the underlying principles of physics they represented: conservation of energy, the work-energy theorem, conservation of momentum.</p>
    
    <p>
There’s far more useful information embedded in the categories applied by experts. So why not present novices with information that’s already organized by function? That notion was behind a new kind of wine store created by Joshua Wesson, an expert sommelier and entrepreneur who founded the chain Best Cellars. “I heard the same questions all the time, and they all reduced to, ‘How can I make sense of the world of wine without having to master all the details?
How can I deal with all these choices when all I want is a wine that goes with pizza?’ ” says Wesson. In most stores selling wine, he observes, bottles are arranged by grape (Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon) or by region (California,
France).</p>
    
    <p> Such classifications communicate little to the uneducated wine consumer.
Wine experts, meanwhile, know about surface-level characteristics like grapes and regions—but they think about wine in terms of function: wines that are luscious and fruity, good for pairing with spicy food; wines that are big and bold and can stand up to a hearty meal; wines that are fizzy and festive, fit for a celebration. “Luscious,” “Big,” and “Fizzy” are, in fact, three of the eight categories Wesson devised for his stores (the others are “Soft,” “Fresh,” “Juicy,” “Smooth,” and “Sweet”). Foregrounding these features is like giving customers a shortcut to thinking the way a sommelier does.</p>
    
    <p> Following Wesson’s lead,
experts more generally can make themselves into accessible models for imitation by communicating the categories they use to organize information, categories that are themselves packed with meaning about how experts’ thinking operates.
These strategies—breaking down agglomerated steps, exaggerating salient features, supplying categories based on function—help pry open the black box of experts’ automatized knowledge and skill. Extended technology may offer an even more direct probe into the mind of the expert. For example: the nature of expertise is now being studied using eye tracking, the automated monitoring of where the expert’s gaze falls, when, and for how long.</p>
    
    <p> Research has shown that,
across disciplines, experts look in ways different from novices: they take in the big picture more rapidly and completely, while focusing on the most important aspects of the scene; they’re less distracted by visual “noise,” and they shift more easily among visual fields, avoiding getting stuck. Within any occupation —among surgeons, pilots, programmers, architects, even high school teachers— experts’ gaze patterns are highly similar, while beginners’ are widely divergent and idiosyncratic.
Yet experts are not aware of how they engage in looking; their gaze patterns are not available for conscious inspection. Eye-tracking technology can capture this aspect of their expertise and make it available for use by novices, guiding their gaze with unobtrusive cues about where to look.</p>
    
    <p> It’s a way of “cheating experience,” as one researcher puts it—a shortcut around hours of observation and practice that could potentially make learning much more efficient and effective.
Researchers are also experimenting with “haptic” signals: physical nudges delivered via special gloves or tools that help mold a novice’s movement patterns into those of an expert. While brainbound approaches to education and training convey information almost exclusively through visual and auditory channels, haptic technologies supply guidance and feedback directly to the body.
Preliminary results suggest that their use can reduce cognitive load and improve performance for many kinds of learners, from students learning to play the violin to medical residents learning to perform laparoscopic surgery.</p>
    
    <p>
In a sense, these innovations represent a technologically enhanced take on the teaching that has unfolded within apprenticeships for centuries—the twenty- first-century version of a master craftsman’s pointing finger or guiding hand.
The indenture contracts for those old-time apprenticeships often proposed to provide the apprentice’s labor in exchange for instruction in “the trade, art, and mystery” of the craft, whether it be carpentry or blacksmithing or shipbuilding.
In an age of knowledge work, the “mystery” of expertise is even more enshrouded, hidden by the scrim of automatization. Pulling this curtain aside requires experts to forgo the familiar conventions of brainbound instruction—to think outside the brain, where their cognition can be seen.</p>
