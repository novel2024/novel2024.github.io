    <p> If you're going to finance a degree, you better calculate the internal rate of return first.
(106) For example, I'm a freelance editor and I bring in a few hundred bucks a month whenever the mood strikes, but I could theoretically make a six-figure income if I put in the same effort as I used to put into my salaried job.
(107) Business students may note that this equation is very similar to the formula for a fixed rate mortgage. Reading further along, mortgage holders will then realize why "mortgage" is French for "death pledge.</p>
    
    <p>" It's essentially a financial construct to keep a person working all his life in exchange for the privilege of owning a large house. Conversely,
this financial weapon can be turned around and used to become financially independent and retire extremely early.
(108) Much like P/E and earnings yield are each other's inverse in stocks.
(109) Those who are familiar with the equation of a perpetuity may be slightly confused about the (1+i) term.</p>
    
    <p> The reason for it is that the withdrawal of principal and the addition of interest does not happen at the same time. Hence, the portfolio needs an extra boost of (1+i) to make it back up to the traditional perpetuity value after the first withdrawal.
(110) Anyone who can do better than that should start a hedge fund.
Consistent outperformance on that level is worth millions.</p>
    
    <p>
(111) There are plenty of books describing how to invest in stocks, real estate, businesses, etc. but this isn't one of them.
(112) Some will point to low- or no-fee arrangements, but these often have a price in opportunity costs. A consistent underperformance isn't cheap either!
(113) The difference between an engineer and a scientist seems to be that the scientist understands this, but the engineer does not, nor does the economist.</p>
    
    <p>
(114) The efficient market theory is such a simplifying assumption. It simply says that price equals value. Without this assumption, a person would have to find the value of every company in the stock market. Instead he can simply say that the value equals the price.</p>
    
    <p> This is a genius insight, insofar as it renders the problem mathematically tractable, but it isn't technically true. It's similar to how the insight that gravity is a two-body force and that the gravitational force between the sun and each individual planet is much stronger than the force between the individual planets makes it possible to compute planetary motion. In astrophysics, this always holds true. In economics and investing, it only holds in most cases.</p>
    
    <p> When it doesn't, we have market bubbles and crashes. These occur when a substantial number of market participants start behaving according to how the market is behaving--that is, how they themselves are behaving. Their behavior becomes self-referential without them realizing it! In particular the problem is now that the average of all investors is so well tracked that a large fraction of the market responds to the average--and as it very often happens, decisions are strongly influenced by what can be measured, rather than what should be measured. In other words, the market is guided by factors (trading, retirement savings) outside of what it really is (equity financing of businesses).</p>
    
    <p> This should make for more volatility, and this is indeed what we see. A great example of this is walking along with a group of people in a new place, like a resort or a city, without a map. It often happens that nobody really knows the way, but everybody thinks that somebody in the group knows the way. As a result, the group will walk along for quite a while, appearing to make decisions until someone finally asks if anyone actually knows where the group is heading.</p>
