    <p> This was a multi-round tournament in which the contenders—bots that had been programmed to behave in particular ways— battled to victory for a monetary prize. A hundred entrants from around the world had faced off, each designed to act according to one of three strategies (or a combination thereof): applying original ideas, engaging in trial and error, or copying others.
As for which strategy worked best, there was really no contest: copying was far and away the most successful approach. The winning entry exclusively copied others—it never innovated.</p>
    
    <p> By comparison, a player-bot whose strategy relied almost entirely on innovation finished ninety-fifth out of the one hundred contestants. The result came as a surprise to Laland and to one of his collaborators, Luke Rendell. “We were expecting someone to come up with a really clever way to say, ‘In these conditions you should copy, and in these conditions you should learn stuff for yourself,’ ” says Rendell. “But the winner just copied all the time.</p>
    
    <p>” Kevin Laland acknowledges that imitation has a bad reputation. But, he says,
researchers like him—in fields from biology to economics to psychology to political science—are discovering how valuable imitation can be as a way of learning new skills and making intelligent decisions. Researchers from these varied disciplines are using models and simulations, as well as historical analyses and real-world case studies, to show that imitation is often the most efficient and effective route to successful performance. And they’re elaborating the reasons why this is so—reasons vividly illustrated by examples from the business world.</p>
    
    <p>
First on the list: by copying others, imitators allow other individuals to act as filters, efficiently sorting through available options. Finance professors Gerald Martin and John Puthenpurackal examined what would happen if an investor did nothing but copy the moves of celebrated investor Warren Buffett. (Buffett’s investment choices are periodically made public, when his company files a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.) An individual who simply buys what Buffett is buying, the researchers found, will earn an average of more than 10 percent above market returns.</p>
    
    <p>
Of course, investors already do take notice of the activity of a high-powered investor like Buffett—but even so, they’re missing out on the benefits of imitating his selections more closely. Investors are leaving money on the table,
Martin suggests, because everyone likes to think they’ve got an innovative strategy or an overlooked gem. Although it can feel good to chart our own course, he says, we often perform better when we copy someone more experienced and more knowledgeable than ourselves.
Second: imitators can draw from a wide variety of solutions instead of being tied to just one.</p>
    
    <p> They can choose precisely the strategy that is most effective in the current moment, making quick adjustments to changing conditions. That sums up the business model of Zara, a worldwide chain of clothing stores based in the industrial city of Arteixo, Spain.
At the headquarters of its parent company, Inditex, Zara’s designers cluster around tables covered with pages ripped from fashion magazines and catalogs;
with photographs snapped of stylish people on streets and in airports; and with the deconstructed parts of other designers’ garments, fresh from the runway.
“Zara is engaged in a permanent quest for inspiration, everywhere and from everybody,” says Spanish journalist Enrique Badía, who has written extensively about the company.</p>
    
    <p> Zara even copies its own customers. Store managers from the chain’s hundreds of locations are in frequent touch with its designers,
passing along new looks spotted on Zara’s fashion-forward clientele.
Kasra Ferdows, a professor of operations and information management at Georgetown University, notes that Zara’s adroit use of imitation has helped make Inditex the largest fashion apparel retailer in the world. Its success, he and two coauthors concluded in a company profile written for the Harvard Business Review, “depends on a constant exchange of information throughout every part of Zara’s supply chain—from customers to store managers, from store managers to market specialists and designers, from designers to production staff.</p>
    
    <p>” Crucially, the “information” that flows so freely at the company concerns not new ideas, but ideas good enough to copy.
The third advantage of imitation: copiers can evade mistakes by steering clear of the errors made by others who went before them, while innovators have no such guide to potential pitfalls. A case in point: diapers. Among parents who rely on disposable diapers, Pampers is a household name.</p>
