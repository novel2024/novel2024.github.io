They often act as a gateway to additional or more expensive things.
They can be taken away from you.
They are hard to get rid of.
The first problem is that they cost money, which is a negative limiting factor (see Effect-mapping).</p>
    
    <p> However, these days many consumer goods are very cheap from a historical perspective, so this is the least of the problems.
With few exceptions, you can have any one thing you want, but few can have it all, not that most don't try. It's very hard for a person in an affluent society not to end up with a lot of stuff, and a lot of effort has to be put into avoiding this. Possessions take up space and the indirect costs of storage55 can be substantial.</p>
    
    <p> It's sometimes jokingly said that a house is merely a roof to cover our possessions. Notice how possessions tend to increase and expand to cover all possible closet and storage space. Sooner or later the house will feel cramped with clutter. This happens when storage becomes inefficient (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle) and more and more effort has to be put into playing Tetris with your stuff and fitting just one more item into an already full closet.</p>
    
    <p>56 At this point consumers start talking about the "need" for more bedrooms. These bedrooms are costly. Not only are bigger houses more expensive, they also come with higher property taxes. It's traditional to heat the entire house to 20C (68F).</p>
    
    <p> In other words, money is paid and gas is burned to make one's possessions as comfortable temperature-wise as the inhabitants.
Interestingly, storage costs are related to the volume and not the price of what you're storing--transportation (and often environmental) costs are typically related to weight. As a consequence, I consider not only the price,
but also volume and mass when I buy something. The costs manifest mainly as real estate costs--that is, paying to put your stuff somewhere--and if you put it in your main residence and subscribe to central heating, the cost of keeping it at a comfortable temperature.</p>
    
    <p> Stuff is also hard to transport, so having a large amount of stuff makes it difficult to move and therefore it acts as an anchor on your mobility.
Maintenance includes everything from simple repair--if you can't do it yourself--to fuel costs and insurance. Lifestyle inflation is a well-known and well-exploited phenomenon. Just think about accessories and the next upgrade.</p>
    
    <p> Things can be taken away from you. They can be lost in a fire,
stolen, or simply confiscated. I don't own anything tangible that would be heartbreaking to lose or which has substantial replacement costs. The sum total of my possessions, including my residence, would cost less than 10% of my net worth.</p>
    
    <p> The final problem is a curious aspect of living in a society of material abundance: Things are much harder to get rid of than they are to acquire in the first place. It's very easy for Aunt Martha to acquire the proverbial ugly vase, but it would be very hard for you to get rid of it, other than throwing it in the trash, and throwing useful things in the trash is simply irresponsible.
A few notes on simple living Simple living isn't about decluttering and reducing the amount of stuff in your life or putting everything on autopilot. Popular approaches attempt to achieve some arrangement of meaningful things that are left after eliminating superfluous stuff or engagements.</p>
