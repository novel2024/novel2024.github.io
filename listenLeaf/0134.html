Material wealth has made it easy to avoid having to develop any social skills or flexibility.
I think it's rare to find two people who agree on everything, and who stay that way; at least that is what divorce statistics suggest. Fortunately, it's possible to reach a degree of compromise that allows one person to live this lifestyle and the other person to live a regular consumer lifestyle.To live together, a couple has to agree on certain things, like not signing up for debt, and how much to spend on common items like housing.</p>
    
    <p> A compromise must be reached. For other things, whereas it would be nice to agree on them, like where to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, whether to have a TV or a car, it's not a crucial issue.
Unless you possess superior persuasive skills, it's no use arguing. Most people (and especially children) will follow your example rather than your suggestions, if they follow at all.</p>
    
    <p> Children will follow practically any example (and believe anything you tell them, so be careful there), but adults are calcified already and usually want to follow their own example rather than yours, unless it becomes clear that your way is better. This means you have to demonstrate that there is a viable, credible alternative. Once your spouse, or any other person you're trying to convince, is ready, he/she will generally come around very quickly. For instance, you may build up a savings account or what people with bills, job-dependence and other liabilities call an emergency fund.</p>
    
    <p> It is very rare for someone not to see the sense in that. If your spouse is already familiar with the concept, start talking about how your "emergency fund" will support you for five years,
say, and that you're thinking about switching careers or taking a long hiatus.
A five year fund is in another category altogether. It is qualitatively different, because it gives you many more opportunities in comparison to the mere breathing room a traditional emergency fund provides.</p>
    
    <p> A normal six month fund is only designed to pay your bills while you go and look for another job because you just got fired, or carry you over while on an extended sick-leave. Those who focus solely on these problems will have a hard time wrapping their heads around the larger timeframe and additional possibilities. However, if your spouse's emergency fund is only the standard six months, but she is beginning to think that her current life path sucks,
she'll most likely start saving more so that she'll have the same options. If your accounts are joint, say you would prefer to save the money whenever she proposes an additional expense.</p>
    
    <p> Suggest that you split some money into his and hers, and if he wants to buy something, fine, but you reserve the same amount of money for savings. After a while, you can start talking about the interest you're earning. One thing that tends to get people going is when I talk about how the money my savings generates on average corresponds to a full-time minimum wage job, and how that essentially means that the person is working for me. That seems to get people thinking- -yes?
If you want your spouse to adopt some change, another thing to try is to find something they are familiar with.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, my wife couldn't see herself living in a tiny house less than 150sqft (my original plan), so I started talking about boats. Then a reader of my blog suggested living in a motorhome. Unlike me, my wife had actually been in an motorhome and lived in a mobile home park at some point, so she was familiar with those and was much less resistant to this idea. Had she not been, I guess one way would have been to start camping and make the trips longer and longer,
after which I'd combine this with the suggestion that if we started camping full-time, we could cut our budget in half.</p>
    
    <p> Often, it is merely a question of exploring all alternatives. You just never know.
Try acquiring a majority of your stuff through swapping or freecycling.
This might make your spouse reconsider the idea of paying for things,
especially when he/she sees the envelopes arriving by mail or when you come home with a leather jacket, proudly announcing that you didn't pay for it or that someone else is now using those rollerskates that took up space in the closet.</p>
