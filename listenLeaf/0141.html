    <p>--or only working seasonally and living the rest of the year on savings--alternatively,
only working a few hours a week (see Intermittent work); or, as will be covered below, the money can be spent on assets which will provide enough cash flow to completely eliminate having to work for money (see Financial independence and investing).
A worker acquires assets by consuming less than his income and then saving and investing the rest. This figure shows the cash flow for a worker who is investing and accumulating assets. Notice that there's an additional flow of cash from assets to stuff.</p>
    
    <p> This cash comes from other people who pay for the usage of the investor's assets. The cash flow from wage to stuff is thus reduced.
A worker in the asset-building phase. Money is being spent on investments in assets instead of stuff while assets begin to produce a cash flow which can be spent on stuff.</p>
    
    <p>
Owning stocks means that the investor gets the profit (but not the wage,
see The salary man) when other workers produce goods and services.
Owning rental units means that the investor gets paid for use of his home.
Owning bonds means that the investor gets paid for use of his money. In fact, combining this figure and this figure, we get this figure, which shows how creditors and debitors fit into the economic system.</p>
    
    <p>
This figure shows the cash flows in a world with only two people. I labeled them creditor and debtor. In reality, there are many creditors and debtors (see text for details).
It also explains why the "rich get richer" and why those who are in debt and work for a living never seem to "get ahead.</p>
    
    <p>" While the figure only shows the cash flow between two people, in reality the assets are diversified via the financial system so that each asset owner gets paid a little amount from many different people and each debt owner uses the assets of many different people as well. However, figuratively speaking it is quite possible to match up the relative sizes of the cash flows between two people. For example, I spend about as much on my total living expenses as an upper- middle-class family spends on their mortgage interest alone. Effectively speaking, I've lent them my money so they can have a house with five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a vaulted foyer, and a two-car garage.</p>
    
    <p> In return,
they pay all my expenses. Hopefully, we both consider this a good deal; I know I do.
Financially independent and working. Since these savings flow into a nonretirement account, money immediately flows out.</p>
    
    <p>
In a free country, roles are chosen, not assigned. Most people choose to become debtors and borrow money so they can increase their spending,
possibly due to a lack of knowledge or maybe simply due to the barrage of advertising that says spending money will result in happiness. However, it's possible to choose the creditor side and save money, eventually buying financial independence. Such financial independence comes from investing in income-generating assets until the cash flow from the assets completely cover all spending on stuff.</p>
    
    <p> When this happens, the cash flow looks like this figure. Here all wages go to increasing assets and work can stop at any time. When the person is no longer working for money, the cash flow situation looks like this figure.
Financially independent and no longer working for money.</p>
