    <p> After returning from the trip, Pollock sat for three days, thinking, on a couch in the Eighth Street apartment. When he rose to his feet he had a plan: he and Lee would move to the East End.
In short order, Pollock and Krasner relocated to a ramshackle farmhouse near the sleepy hamlet of Springs, Long Island. Pollock spent hours on the house’s back porch, gazing out at the trees and at the marshland stretching down to Bonac Creek.</p>
    
    <p> The move to Springs would inaugurate a years-long period of relative peace for the volatile painter. “It was a healing place,” says Audrey Flack, a fellow artist who spent time with the couple on Long Island. “And they were in great need of being healed.” Nature changed Pollock’s thinking—gently tempering his raging intensity— and it also changed his art.</p>
    
    <p> In New York, Pollock worked at an easel, painting intricate, involved designs. In Springs, where he worked in a converted barn full of light and views of nature, he began spreading his canvases on the floor and pouring or flinging paint from above. Art critics view this period of Pollock’s life as the high point of his career, the years when he produced “drip painting” masterpieces like Shimmering Substance (1946) and Autumn Rhythm (1950).
The fulcrum for this turn of fortune was the time Pollock spent musing in his New York apartment; the artist said it was then that he realized he would always be homeless when inside.</p>
    
    <p> Out of doors, he found his home.
 ARTISTS LIKE Jackson Pollock are not the only people whose mental activity is shaped by their surroundings; all of us think differently depending on where we are. The field of cognitive science commonly compares the human brain to a computer, but the influence of place reveals a major limitation of this analogy:
while a laptop works the same way whether it’s being used at the office or while we’re sitting in a park, the brain is deeply affected by the setting in which it operates. And nature provides particularly rich and fertile surroundings with which to think.</p>
    
    <p> That’s because our brains and bodies evolved to thrive in the outdoors; our ancient forebears practiced a lifestyle that would look, to us, like “a camping trip that lasts a lifetime,” as a pair of ecologists has put it.
Over hundreds of thousands of years of dwelling outside, the human organism became precisely calibrated to the characteristics of its verdant environment, so that even today, our senses and our cognition are able to easily and efficiently process the particular features present in natural settings. Our minds are tuned to the frequencies of the organic world. No such evolutionary adjustment has prepared us for the much more recent emergence of the world in which we now spend almost all our time: the built environment, with its sharp lines and unforgiving textures and relentless motion.</p>
    
    <p> We’ve set up camp amid the high- rises and highways of our modern milieu, but our minds are not at ease in this habitat. The mismatch between the stimuli we evolved to process and the sights and sounds that regularly confront our senses has the effect of depleting our limited mental resources. We are left frazzled, fatigued, and prone to distraction,
simply as a function of the hours we spend in a setting for which we are biologically ill-equipped.
Just how much of our lives unfolds inside buildings and vehicles is revealed by scientists’ time use studies: only about 7 percent of our time is spent outdoors.</p>
    
    <p> That’s much, much less than for our nature-dwelling ancestors, of course, but it’s meager even when compared to that of Americans twenty years ago. More than 60 percent of American adults report spending five hours or less outside in nature each week. Children, too, engage in outdoor recreation far less frequently than earlier generations; only 26 percent of mothers report that their kids play outside every day. Such trends are likely to continue: more than half of Earth’s humans now live in cities, and by 2050 that figure is predicted to reach almost 70 percent.</p>
    
    <p>
Yet despite these massive shifts in culture, our biology remains identical to that of our progenitors. Even now, our brains and bodies respond to nature in ways that reveal the deep imprint of our evolution in the outdoors. In fact, we can draw a direct line from the kind of landscapes we enjoy today to the settings in which our species evolved. One place to begin drawing that line is with the crowds of people who throng to a half-mile-wide strip of land in the middle of Manhattan Island.</p>
