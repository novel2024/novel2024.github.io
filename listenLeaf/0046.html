    <p> As mentioned earlier in this book, some psychopaths go on to become very successful in their fields because of their risk-taking, laser-sharp focus. A child that is seemingly destructive and restless can be molded to become something great in their life. Instead of worrying that your child will become a serial killer, think about how you can turn them into the next world-famous CEO. A good thing about kids is that they are easy to distract.</p>
    
    <p> Keep your child busy, and they will not have the time to think about all the cruel things they could be doing with their thrill- seeking selves.
Depending on the nature of the disorder that is present in the child, there might be a need for professional intervention. Professionals who work with kids that exhibit psychopathic behaviors do not try to change them because they know that it is all in the brain, and there’s not much that you can do.
Instead of changing the kids, the professionals instead opt to work with what is left of the ‘good brain’ to push the kids towards good behavior.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, even though a psychopath’s brain might not be capable of empathy and emotion, they are still able to recognize reward and the excitement of getting that reward. What clinicians do therefore is to train the kid to do good in exchange for a reward. Psychopaths love winning, and the same is true for kids who exhibit psychopathic tendencies. This reward approach is also used in prisons where the population of psychopaths tends to be higher.</p>
    
    <p>
If you have a child who is showing signs of being a problem child as far as the listed signs go, you must be very careful about how you call out the problem. The messages that children hear about themselves are what they grow up to believe. If a child grows up being called stupid, they will live out their stupid to the best of their ability. A child, regardless of their psychopathic disposition, will grow into something great if they hear reinforcing messages about themselves.</p>
    
    <p> Nurture may not always win over nature every time, but it is always worth a shot. It might be thinking of something empowering to say to a child who kills little animals but labeling them as a killer will only give them something to aspire to.
 Conclusion There is no doubt that hearing there are people out there whose sole purpose in life is to manipulate and influence others is not comforting news. This is the kind of information that is guaranteed to make you skeptical about all your interactions.</p>
    
    <p> You might find yourself wondering whether the people in your life like you for you or for the things that you are able to provide.
While it is true that there are bad people out there, it is also true that there are some pretty good people living among us. The good news is that the number of people who measure highly on the narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism scales is much lower than the number of people who measure much lower on the same scales. What this means is that not everybody is out to get you.</p>
    
    <p> At worst, one out of five people is out to get you. For example, if you have five bosses, one of them is likely to be a psychopath. This is not too bad. You just have to make sure you get the other four on your team, and you will be good to go.</p>
    
    <p>
In all seriousness, however, it helps to stay conscious of the bad sides and the good sides to life and people. This book is an acknowledgment of the bad sides that exist--which sometimes can be used for good, depending on how you look at it. A Machiavellian leader who is committed to protecting his people at whatever cost, for instance, can be a great asset to have in a community.
That being noted, it is also important to acknowledge the many ways that smart people use to manipulate others into doing not-so-smart things.</p>
