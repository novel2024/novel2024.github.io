    <p> Yet how does one put a price on this asset?
28 Similarly, a person with a high-paying job may be chronically stressed or sedentary and thus at a higher risk of developing various lifestyle diseases.
Yet how does one put a price on this liability?
It may not be possible to put a precise price on such assets and liabilities, but it's possible to draw a diagram that illustrates them. This figure shows the scenario for a locked-in person as described in The lock- in. On the x-axis is shown various areas of a person's life--working, living,
eating, etc.</p>
    
    <p> Also shown is a dashed line that demarcates areas where the person is paying and where the person is getting paid. A locked-in person has almost no useful skills. The one skill they do have provides all of their income. Consequently, a locked-in specialist gets paid for only a single area, but he is paid a lot, as the tall spike indicates.</p>
    
    <p> This is the same spike as in this figure. Yet all other areas are below the dashed line, indicating that those areas must be paid for.
This figure shows the degree of skills for a locked-in person. The dashed line demarcates the point where a person neither spends nor receives money.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, the person is able to do this activity for free. Notice that for the locked-in person, most activities cost money. These activities are all supported by a single skill-based income.
Contrast this with a person who has multiple personal skill-assets, as in this figure.</p>
    
    <p> While there may not be time to develop a skill to the same remunerative level as the specialist, he nevertheless compensates by being able to earn some income in several areas while needing less money in other areas, because he's able to do some work himself and to shop for lower prices. This is a person who is less dependent on the market system than the specialist. It's a person for whom net worth is less relevant. In extreme cases, money may even be irrelevant.</p>

This figure shows the degree of skills for a Renaissance man.
Notice how he pays very little for most activities. Also notice how he's able to derive money from several activities.
It is curious that experts recommend that investments be broadly diversified, while at the same time recommending that job skills should be highly concentrated.</p>
    
    <p> The Renaissance man has a lot of diversified human capital, but it will be difficult, though not impossible, to sell it on a market tailored for specialists. Selling isn't the point, though. Rather than focusing on how to sell, it's often more efficient to focus on how not to buy! And a wide assortment of skills can substitute for a lot of otherwise required income.
According to experts on expertise (yes, there is such as thing!), it takes 1,000 hours of focused effort to be considered competent in a subject, 3,000 hours to master it, and 10,000 hours to become an expert (see Gauging mastery).</p>
    
    <p>29 Considering that the average person spends four hours a day or almost 1,500 hours a year watching TV or playing computer games, it is not an insurmountable task over a period of years to become an expert in a field while simultaneously becoming competent in several other fields, perhaps even mastering one of them.
Which skills should one focus on? The Renaissance men of the 17th century strove to increase their ability to defend themselves with a variety of weapons.
