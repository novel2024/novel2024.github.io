    <p> A particular sort of machine occasioned the second major development of the time:
a flood of texts produced by the newly common printing press. More than any generation before them, the thinkers of the Romantic era bore what literary critic Walter Jackson Bate called “the burden of the past,” as masterworks from earlier eras became widely available for the first time. Immersed in a sea of their predecessors’ words, they felt an urgent need to create something new and fresh and never before said.
William Blake, the English poet and artist born in 1757, was one of the earliest and most passionately original Romantics.</p>
    
    <p> In creating works like Songs of Innocence and of Experience and Visions of the Daughters of Albion, Blake employed a technique he had invented himself, relief etching, in which he used acid-resistant chemicals to mark a copper plate, then applied acid to etch away the untreated areas. (The mystical-minded Blake claimed that his deceased brother Robert had revealed the technique to him in a vision.) These works took a form that was also newly devised by Blake: illuminated books that combined text and drawings and that were etched, printed, and colored by Blake himself.
No two books were the same.</p>
    
    <p> And their content was nothing if not original: an elaborate invented cosmology featuring allegorical figures with names like Urizen (representing reason) and Los (imagination). In his illuminated book Jerusalem, Los—Blake’s alter ego—voiced a sentiment that might have served as the Romantics’ motto. “I must create a system,” Blake’s character declared, or else “be enslav’d by another man’s.” Under the Romantics’ influence, imitation did not merely become less favored than previously.</p>
    
    <p> It came to be actively disdained and disparaged—an attitude that was carried forward into succeeding decades. The naturalists of the late nineteenth century described imitation as the habit of children, women, and “savages,” and held up original expression as the preserve of European men.
Innovation climbed to the top of the cultural value system, while imitation sank to an unaccustomed low.
This is the cult of originality to which we ourselves subscribe—more so now than ever before.</p>
    
    <p> Our society celebrates pioneers and trailblazers—like, for example, the late Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer founder famous for offering dazzling onstage introductions of the company’s latest inventions. His company’s advertisements glorified those who break the mold, rather than those who allow themselves to be shaped by it. “Here’s to the crazy ones,” intoned the voice-over of an Apple commercial that aired in 1997. “The misfits.</p>
    
    <p> The rebels.
The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>
    
    <p> They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.” Think different, went the ad’s tagline. But at least in some quarters, thinking the same—that is, engaging in imitation—is now gaining new respect.</p>

 IT WAS THE “proudest moment” of Kevin Laland’s professional career, he says:
the prestigious journal Science published a photograph of Laland mowing his lawn.
In the picture, Laland’s three-year-old son is walking just behind him, intently pushing his own toy lawnmower; the photo accompanied a commentary on Laland’s research about the importance of imitation in human culture. In the same issue, Laland, a professor of biology at the University of St. Andrews in the UK, reported on the results of a computerized competition he and his collaborators had set up.</p>
