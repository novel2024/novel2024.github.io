    <p> Instead, help them.
Keep running costs down but pay for value.
Maintain health to avoid the personal and monetary cost of sickness.
Build up the capital to live as a capitalist or the skills to always find a new job.</p>
    
    <p>
Focus on productive assets rather than stuff.
Focus on developing skills rather than on passive entertainment.
Gain the maximum in satisfaction with the minimum expenditure of money and energy.
Reintegration is an important part of this design.</p>
    
    <p> Normal life (see The lock-in) has maximized separation (see Economic degrees of freedom) due to an underlying engineering frame of mind (minimize degrees of freedom) and the economic idea of comparative advantage, with outsourcing being its latest manifestation. This separation occurs not just over the span of decades with schooling, working, and retirement happening in three separate time periods, but also on a daily basis, where people drive dozens of miles away from their home for a set amount of hours in their separate cars and then return late to their separate houses in the early evening to consume stuff acquired elsewhere.
What worked for me was reintegrating much of this behavior, to eliminate the personal inefficiencies this way of life creates. For instance, I lived close to work; most of my work I do at home, because it's mostly telecommuting work.</p>
    
    <p> I don't dress up for work, but according to season. I get around not by car, but by foot and bicycle, which provides free exercise.
I retired from my career, but I still work, and I still learn. Hence, I no longer get divided and conquered under the guise of comparative advantage.</p>

In the following descriptions I have omitted many details of implementation--consider them left as exercises for the student--whose inclusion would otherwise result in this book being several hundred pages longer. All the technical details can be learned from other books and websites in a matter of months. I trust that the reader, after hearing about a specific method, will be able to fill in the blanks. For instance, if I suggest making your own laundry detergent or a self-watering container, I trust the reader to find the pertinent details on the Internet.</p>
    
    <p> This leaves the technicalities to the reader and I can restrict myself to pointing out what to look for and how to devise a strategy.
Things Doing anything usually requires a tool and someone using that tool. An experienced tool user will think of the tool as an extension of himself.
Hence, it's hard to tell where the tool ends and the tool user begins; after all,
what is a tool really, if nobody's using it? This line of thinking extends to all the things we surround ourselves with.</p>
    
    <p> If no one is living in it, a house is not a home but is rather a useless arrangement of sticks and bricks (see Building blocks). It's said that a person with skills can do more with less,
yet nobody is so skilled to be able to do everything with nothing, and many tools have indeed allowed people to do things better than they otherwise would. On the other hand, many have become unskilled by the easy availability of technological replacements, and so they sometimes end up doing things worse, as well as ending up with a large amount of stuff. There should therefore be a continuous drive toward internalizing skills.</p>
    
    <p> After all,
you can always lose your tools, but skills stay with you.
From a skill-based-Renaissance perspective,
possessions are problematic in the following ways and acquisition should therefore be considered carefully:
They cost money.
They take up space.
They require maintenance.</p>
