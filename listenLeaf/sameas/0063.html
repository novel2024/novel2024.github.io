    <p> And the fact that it feels good is the fuel we need to wake up and keep working even when the world around us can be objectively awful, and pessimism abounds.
— In 1984 Jane Pauley interviewed twenty-eight-year-old Bill Gates. “Some people call you a genius,” Pauley said. “I know that might embarrass you but .</p>
    
    <p> . .” Gates deadpans. No emotion.</p>
    
    <p> No response.
“OK, I guess that doesn’t embarrass you,” Pauley says with an awkward laugh.
Again, zero reaction from Gates.
Of course he was a genius.</p>
    
    <p> And he knew it.
Gates dropped out of college at nineteen because he thought a computer should be on every desk in every home. You only do that when you have relentless confidence in your abilities. Paul Allen once wrote about the first time he met Bill:
You could tell three things about Bill Gates pretty quickly.</p>
    
    <p> He was really smart. He was really competitive; he wanted to show you how smart he was. And he was really, really persistent.
But there was another side to Bill Gates.</p>
    
    <p> It was almost paranoia,
virtually the opposite of his unshakable confidence.
From the day he started Microsoft, he insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company alive for twelve months with no revenue coming in.
In 1995 he was asked by Charlie Rose why he kept so much cash on hand. Things change so fast in technology that next year’s business wasn’t guaranteed, he said.</p>
    
    <p> “Including Microsoft’s.” In 2007 he reflected:
I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, “What if we don’t get paid, will I be able to meet the payroll?” Here again, optimism and confidence mixed with heavy pessimism.
What Gates seems to get is that you can only be an optimist in the long run if you’re pessimistic enough to survive the short run.
An important thing to recognize here is that optimism and pessimism exist on a spectrum.</p>
    
    <p>
At one end you have the pure optimist. They think everything is great,
will always be great, and see all negativity as a character flaw. Part is rooted in ego: they’re so confident in themselves they can’t fathom anything going wrong.
At the other end you have the pure pessimists.</p>
