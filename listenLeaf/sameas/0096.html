— Psychologist Ivan Pavlov trained his dogs to drool.
He did this by ringing a bell before they were fed. The dogs learned to associate the sound of the bell with an imminent meal, which triggered a salivary response.
Pavlov’s dogs became famous for teaching psychologists about the science of learned behavior.</p>
    
    <p>
Less known is what happened to the poor dogs years later.
A massive flood in 1924 swept through Leningrad, where Pavlov kept his lab and kennel. Flood water came right up to the dogs’ cages. Several were killed.</p>
    
    <p> The surviving dogs were forced to swim a quarter mile to safety. Pavlov later called it the most traumatic thing the dogs had ever experienced, by far.
Something fascinating then happened: The dogs seemingly forgot their learned behavior of drooling when the bell rang.
Pavlov wrote about one dog eleven days after the floodwaters receded:
After the application of the [bell] all the remaining conditioned reflexes almost completely disappeared, the animal again declined the food, became very restless and continuously stared at the door.</p>
    
    <p>
Ever the curious scientist, Pavlov spent months studying how the flood changed his dogs’ behavior. Many were never the same—they had completely different personalities after the flood, and learned behavior that was previously ingrained vanished. He summed up what happened, and how it applies to humans:
Different conditions productive of extreme excitation often lead to profound and prolonged loss of balance in nervous and psychic activity . .</p>
    
    <p> . neuroses and psychoses may develop as a result of extreme danger to oneself or to near friends, or even the spectacle of some frightful event not affecting one directly.
People tend to have short memories. Most of the time they can forget about bad experiences and fail to heed lessons previously learned.</p>
    
    <p>
But hard-core stress leaves a scar.
Experiencing something that makes you stare ruin in the face and question whether you’ll survive can permanently reset your expectations and change behaviors that were previously ingrained.
“A mind that is stretched by new experience can never go back to its old dimensions,” said Oliver Wendell Holmes.
It’s why the generation who lived through the Great Depression never viewed money the same afterward.</p>
    
    <p> They saved more money, took on less debt, and were wary of risk—for the rest of their lives. This was obvious even before the Depression was over. Frederick Lewis Allen quotes a Fortune magazine article written in 1936:
The present-day college generation is fatalistic . .</p>
    
    <p> . it will not stick its neck out. It keeps its pants buttoned, its chin up, and its mouth shut. If we take the mean average to be the truth, it is a cautious, subdued, unadventurous generation.</p>
