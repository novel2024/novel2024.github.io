    <p> But what’s popular? Supplements, hacks, and pills.
Mark Twain said kids provide the most interesting information, “for they tell all they know and then they stop.” Adults tend to lose this skill. Or they learn a new skill: how to dazzle with nonsense.</p>
    
    <p> Stephen King explains in his book On Writing:
This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. I figured the shorter the book, the less bullshit.
Poetry.
— The question then is: Why? Why are complexity and length so appealing when simplicity and brevity will do?
A few reasons:
Complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness.</p>
    
    <p>
In most fields a handful of variables dictate the majority of outcomes. But paying attention to only those few variables can feel like you’re leaving too much of the outcome to fate. The more knobs you can fiddle with—the hundred-tab spreadsheet, or the Big Data analysis—the more control you feel you have over the situation, if only because the impression of knowledge increases.
The flip side is that paying attention to only a few variables while ignoring the majority of others can make you look ignorant.</p>
    
    <p> If a client says,
“What about this, what’s happening here?” and you respond, “Oh, I have no idea, I don’t even look at that,” the odds that you’ll sound uninformed are greater than the odds you’ll sound like you’ve mastered simplicity.
Things you don’t understand create a mystique around people who do.
If you say something I didn’t know but can understand, I might think you’re smart. If you say something I can’t understand, I might think you have an ability to think about a topic in ways I can’t, which is a whole different species of admiration.</p>
    
    <p> When you understand things I don’t, I have a hard time judging the limits of your knowledge in that field, which makes me more prone to taking your views at face value.
Length is often the only thing that can signal effort and thoughtfulness.
A typical nonfiction book covering a single topic is perhaps 250 pages, or something like 65,000 words.
The funny thing is the average reader does not come close to finishing most books they buy.</p>
    
    <p> Even among bestsellers, average readers quit after a few dozen pages. Length, then, has to serve a purpose other than providing more material.
My theory is that length indicates the author has spent more time thinking about a topic than you have, which can be the only data point signaling they might have insights you don’t. It doesn’t mean their thinking is right.</p>
    
    <p> And you may understand their point after two chapters. But the purpose of chapters 3–16 is often to show that the author has done so much work that chapters 1 and 2 might have some insight. Same goes for research reports and white papers.
Simplicity feels like an easy walk.</p>
    
    <p> Complexity feels like a mental marathon.
If the reps don’t hurt when you’re exercising, you’re not really exercising.
Pain is the sign of progress that tells you you’re paying the unavoidable cost of admission. Short and simple communication is different.</p>
