    <p>” — A few things about good stories worth remembering:
When a topic is complex, stories are like leverage.
Leverage squeezes the full potential out of something with less effort.
Stories leverage ideas in the same way that debt leverages assets.
Trying to explain something like physics is hard if you’re deadlifting facts and formulas.</p>
    
    <p> But if you can explain things like how fire works with a story about balls rolling down hills and running into one another—that’s what physicist Richard Feynman, an astounding storyteller, used to do— you can explain something complex in seconds, without much effort.
Stories do more than persuade others. They can help you just as much.
Part of what made Albert Einstein so talented was his imagination and ability to distill complexity into a simple scene in his head.</p>
    
    <p> When he was sixteen he started imagining what it would be like to ride on a beam of light, holding on to the sides like a flying carpet and thinking through how it would travel and bend. Soon after, he began imagining what your body would feel like if you were in an enclosed elevator riding through space. He contemplated gravity by imagining bowling balls and billiard balls competing for space on a trampoline surface. He could process a textbook of information with the effort of a daydream.</p>

Ken Burns once said, “The common stories are one plus one equals two.
We get it, they make sense. But the good stories are about one plus one equals three.” That’s leverage.</p>
    
    <p>
The most persuasive stories are about what you want to believe is true,
or are an extension of what you’ve experienced firsthand.
Poet Ralph Hodgson put this well when he said, “Some things have to be believed to be seen.” Poor evidence can be a very compelling story if that story scratches an itch someone wants to go away, or gives context to a belief they want to be true.
Stories get diverse people to focus attention on a single point.</p>
    
    <p>
Steven Spielberg noted this:
The most amazing thing for me is that every single person who sees a movie . . . brings a whole set of unique experiences.</p>
    
    <p>
Now, through careful manipulation and good storytelling, you can get everybody to clap at the same time, to laugh at the same time, and to be afraid at the same time.
Mark Twain once said he knew he was a successful author when Kaiser Wilhelm II said he’d read every Twain book, and later that day a porter at his hotel said the same. “Great books are wine,” Twain said, “but my books are water. But everybody drinks water.</p>
    
    <p>” He found the universal emotions that influence everyone, regardless of who they were or where they were from, and got them to nod their heads in the same direction. It’s nearly magic.
Guiding people’s attention to a single point is one of the most powerful life skills.
Good stories create so much hidden opportunity among things you assume can’t be improved.</p>
