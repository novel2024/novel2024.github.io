    <p> Incentives can be cultural and tribal, where people support things because they don’t want to upset or become banished from their social group. A lot of people can resist financial incentives; cultural and tribal incentives are more seductive.
One of the strongest pulls of incentives is the desire for people to hear only what they want to hear and see only what they want to see.
In 1997 a religious cult called Heaven’s Gate believed a spaceship traveling behind a comet was heading to Earth to pick up true believers and carry them to paradise.</p>
    
    <p>
Several cult members pitched in to buy a high-powered telescope. They wanted to see the spaceship with their own eyes.
They found the comet in the sky. But there was no spaceship following it.</p>
    
    <p>
So they took the telescope back to the store for a refund. The store manager asked if there was something wrong. They said yes, the telescope was clearly broken—because it didn’t show the spaceship.
There’s a long history of people believing what they want to believe.</p>
    
    <p>
And not just cult members.
It’s just so hard to be purely objective when incentives push you toward one direction.
In 1923, Henry Luce wanted to create a magazine called Facts. It was going to report only on things that were objectively true.</p>
    
    <p> But Luce soon realized that was harder than you’d think. Instead he called it Time, with the idea that saving readers time with succinct stories was the most value a publisher could add. “Show me a man who thinks he’s objective and I’ll show you a man who’s deceiving himself,” Luce said.
Some variation of this applies to many fields, especially service industries where someone pays for an expert’s opinion.</p>
    
    <p> There can be a difference between knowing what’s right and making a living delivering what you know to be right.
This may be most common in investing, law, and medicine, when “do nothing” is the best answer, but “do something” is the career incentive.
Sometimes it’s amoral, but it can be an innocent form of “cover your butt.” Mostly, though, I think an advisor just feels useless if they tell a client “we don’t need to do anything here.</p>
    
    <p>” In the quest to be helpful they add complexity even when none is needed, or when it might backfire.
Years ago Jon Stewart interviewed investor and CNBC host Jim Cramer.
When pressed on CNBC content that ranged from contradictory to inane,
Cramer said, “Look, we’ve got seventeen hours of live TV a day to do.” Stewart responded, “Maybe you can cut down on that.</p>
    
    <p>” He’s right. But if you’re in the TV business, you can’t.
A doctor once told me the biggest thing they don’t teach in medical school is the difference between medicine and being a doctor—medicine is a biological science, while being a doctor is often a social skill of managing expectations,
understanding the insurance system,
communicating effectively, and so on.
Three things stick out here.</p>
