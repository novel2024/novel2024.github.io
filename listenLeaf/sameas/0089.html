Saying you have a ten-year time horizon doesn’t exempt you from all the nonsense that happens in the next ten years. Everyone has to experience the recessions, the bear markets, the meltdowns, the surprises, and the memes.
So rather than assuming long-term thinkers don’t have to deal with short-term nonsense, ask the question, “How can I endure a never-ending parade of nonsense?” Long-term thinking can be a deceptive safety blanket that people assume lets them bypass the painful and unpredictable short run. But it never does.</p>
    
    <p>
It might be the opposite: The longer your time horizon, the more calamities and disasters you’ll experience. Baseball player Dan Quisenberry once said,
“The future is much like the present, only longer.” Dealing with that reality requires a certain kind of alignment that’s easy to overlook.
Your belief in the long run isn’t enough.</p>
    
    <p> Your partners, coworkers,
spouses, and friends have to sign up for the ride.
An investment manager who loses 40 percent can tell his investors, “It’s okay, we’re in this for the long run” and believe it. But the investors may not believe it. They might bail.</p>
    
    <p> The firm might not survive. Then even if the manager turns out to be right, it doesn’t matter—no one’s around to benefit.
The same thing happens when you have the guts to stick it out but your spouse doesn’t.
Or when you have a great idea that will take time to prove, but your boss and coworkers aren’t as patient.</p>
    
    <p>
These are not rarities. They’re some of the most common outcomes in life.
A lot of it comes from the gap between what you believe and what you can convince other people of.
People mock how much short-term thinking there is in the financial industry, and they should.</p>
    
    <p> But I also get it: The reason so many financial professionals stray toward short-termism is because it’s the only way to run a viable business when customers flee at the first sign of trouble. But the reason customers flee is often because investors have done such a poor job communicating how investing works, what their strategy is, what they should expect as an investor, and how to deal with inevitable volatility and cyclicality.
Eventually being right is one thing. But can you eventually be right and convince those around you? That’s completely different, and easy to overlook.</p>
    
    <p>
Patience is often stubbornness in disguise.
The world changes, which makes changing your mind not just helpful,
but crucial.
But changing your mind is hard because fooling yourself into believing a falsehood is so much easier than admitting a mistake.
Long-term thinking can become a crutch for those who are wrong but don’t want to change their mind.</p>
    
    <p> They say, “I’m just early” or “Everyone else is crazy” when they can’t let go of something that used to be true but the world has moved on from.
Doing long-term thinking well requires identifying when you’re being patient versus just stubborn. Not an easy thing to do. The only solution is knowing the very few things in your industry that will never change and putting everything else in a bucket that’s in constant need of updating and adapting.</p>
