    <p>” “While I was away I got this great idea . . .” The irony is that people can get some of their most important work done outside of work, when they’re free to think and ponder.</p>
    
    <p> The struggle is that we take time off maybe once a year, without realizing that time to think is a key element of many jobs, and one that a traditional work schedule doesn’t accommodate very well.
Not all jobs require creativity or critical thinking. But those that do function better with time devoted to wandering and being curious, in ways that are removed from scheduled work but actually help tackle your biggest work problems.
It’s just hard to do that because we’re set on the idea that a typical work day should be eight uninterrupted hours seated at your desk.</p>
    
    <p>
Tell your boss you found a trick that will make you more creative and productive, and she’ll ask what you’re waiting for. Tell her that your trick is taking a ninety-minute walk in the middle of the day, and she might say no,
you need to work. Another way to put this is that a lot of workers have “thought jobs” without much time to think.
The New York Times once wrote of former Secretary of State George Shultz:
His hour of solitude was the only way he could find time to think about the strategic aspects of his job.</p>
    
    <p> Otherwise, he would be constantly pulled into moment-to-moment tactical issues,
never able to focus on larger questions of the national interest.
Albert Einstein put it this way:
I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head. If my work isn’t going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination.
Mozart felt the same way:
When I am traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep—it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.</p>
    
    <p>
This meshes with a Stanford study that showed walking increases creativity by 60 percent.
Someone once asked Charlie Munger what Warren Buffett’s secret was.
“I would say half of all the time he spends is sitting on his ass and reading.” He has a lot of time to think.</p>
    
    <p>
The traditional eight-hour work schedule is great if your job is repetitive or physically constraining. But for the large and growing number of “thought jobs,” it might not be.
You might be better off taking two hours in the morning to stay at home thinking about some big problem.
Or go for a long midday walk to ponder why something isn’t working.</p>
    
    <p>
Or leave at 3:00 p.m. and spend the rest of the day envisioning a new strategy.
It’s not about working less.</p>
    
    <p> It’s the opposite: A lot of thought jobs basically never stop, and without structuring time to think and be curious,
you wind up less efficient during the hours that are devoted to sitting at your desk cranking out work. This is the opposite of the concept of “hustle porn,” where people want to look busy at all times because they think it’s noble.
Nassim Taleb says, “My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.” More than a measure of success, I think it’s a key ingredient.</p>
