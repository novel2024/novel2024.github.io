What would you do?
You would buy as many stocks as you possibly could. You would mortgage your house and buy more. You’d consider selling a kidney and buy more still. That would be the reasonable thing to do!
And in the process, the price of stocks would get bid up.</p>
    
    <p> Their valuations would become ever more expensive. They would get so expensive that their future return prospects would decline close to zero.
And at that very moment, the seeds of breakdown would start to sprout.
The higher stock valuations become, the more sensitive markets are to being caught off guard by life’s ability to surprise you in ways you never imagined.</p>
    
    <p>
Surprise has six common characteristics:
• Incomplete information • Uncertainty • Randomness • Chance • Unfortunate timing • Poor incentives With assets priced high and no room for error, markets would be hanging on by a thread, crushed at the first sniff of anything less than perfection.
The irony is that when markets are guaranteed not to crash—or more realistically, when people think that’s the case—they are far more likely to crash.
The mere idea of stability causes a smart and rational movement toward bidding asset prices up high enough to cause instability.
Stability is destabilizing.</p>
    
    <p>
Or, put another way: Calm plants the seeds of crazy. Always has, always will.
— “Everything feels unprecedented when you haven’t engaged with history,” writer Kelly Hayes once wrote.
It’s such an important idea.</p>

Historian Dan Carlin wrote in his book The End Is Always Near:
Pretty much nothing separates us from human beings in earlier eras than how much less disease affects us.  .  .  .</p>
    
    <p> If we moderns lived for one year with the sort of death rates our pre- industrial age ancestors perpetually lived with, we’d be in societal shock.
Modern life in general is about as safe as it’s ever been. And effectively all the improvement over the last century has come from a decline in infectious disease. In 1900 roughly eight hundred per one hundred thousand Americans died each year from infectious disease.</p>
    
    <p> By 2014 that was forty- six per one hundred thousand—a 94 percent decline.
This decline is probably the best thing ever to happen to humanity.
To follow that sentence with “but” is a step too far. It’s an entirely good thing.</p>
    
    <p>
However, it creates an anomaly.
The decline in deaths from infectious diseases has made the world less equipped to handle them—maybe not medically,
but certainly psychologically. What was a tragic but expected part of life a hundred years ago is now a tragic and inconceivable part of modern life—which is indeed what made the COVID-19 pandemic so shocking and overwhelming.
Clark Whelton, a former speechwriter for New York City mayor Ed Koch, once wrote:
For those who grew up in the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing unusual about finding yourself threatened by contagious disease.</p>
