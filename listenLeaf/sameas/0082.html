J Incentives: The Most Powerful Force in the World When the incentives are crazy, the behavior is crazy.
People can be led to justify and defend nearly anything.
ason Zweig of The Wall Street Journal says there are three ways to be a professional writer:
1. Lie to people who want to be lied to, and you’ll get rich.</p>
    
    <p>
2. Tell the truth to those who want the truth, and you’ll make a living.
3. Tell the truth to those who want to be lied to, and you’ll go broke.</p>
    
    <p>
What a wonderful summary of the power of incentives, and an explanation for why people do some of the crazy things they do.
— By age thirty-five, Akinola Bolaji had already spent two decades scamming people online, posing as an American fisherman to con vulnerable widows into sending him money.
The New York Times asked the Nigerian how he felt about causing so much harm to innocent people. He replied: “Definitely there is always conscience.</p>
    
    <p> But poverty will not make you feel the pain.” Scamming people is easier to justify in your head when you’re starving.

Then, one day, he got introduced to selling crack. He recalled: “Haha,
now I’m thinking, commercial art?! Haha. I’m out here for twenty minutes and I can make some real, real money, man.</p>
    
    <p>” Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko once speculated that during Galileo’s day, several scientists believed Earth revolved around the sun. “But they had families to feed,” so they never spoke up.
These are extreme examples of something everyone—you, me, everyone —is susceptible to and more influenced by than we want to admit:
Incentives are the most powerful force in the world and can get people to justify or defend almost anything.
When you understand how powerful incentives can be, you stop being surprised when the world lurches from one absurdity to the next.</p>
    
    <p> If asked,
“How many people in the world are truly crazy?” I might say, I don’t know,
3 percent to 5 percent. But if I asked, “How many people in the world would be willing to do something crazy if their incentives were right?” I’d say, oh, easily 50 percent or more.
No matter how much information and context you have, nothing is more persuasive than what you desperately want or need to be true. And as Daniel Kahneman once wrote, “It is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.</p>
