    <p>8 billion years.
The time, not the little changes, is what moves the needle. Take minuscule changes and compound them by 3.8 billion years and you get results that are indistinguishable from magic.</p>
    
    <p>
That’s the real lesson from evolution: If you have a big number in the exponent slot, you do not need extraordinary change to deliver extraordinary results. It’s not intuitive, but it’s so powerful.
“The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function,” physicist Albert Bartlett used to say.
A lot of things work like that.</p>
    
    <p>
An area where we commonly see this shortcoming in action is investing.
Investor Howard Marks once talked about an investor whose annual results were never ranked in the top quartile, but over a fourteen-year period he was in the top 4 percent of all investors. If he keeps those mediocre returns up for another ten years he may be in the top 1 percent of his peers —one of the greatest of his generation despite being unremarkable in any given year.
So much focus in investing is on what people can do right now, this year,
maybe next year.</p>
    
    <p> “What are the best returns I can earn?” seems like such an intuitive question to ask.
But like evolution, that’s not where the magic happens.
If you understand the math behind compounding you realize the most important question is not “How can I earn the highest returns?” It’s “What are the best returns I can sustain for the longest period of time?” Little changes compounded for a long time create extraordinary changes.
Same as ever.</p>

Next, we’ll look at the dangers of overconfidence.
O Elation and Despair Progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist.
ptimism and pessimism are so hard to deal with.
Pessimism is more intellectually seductive than optimism and captures more of our attention.</p>
    
    <p> It’s vital for survival, helping us prepare for risks before they arrive.
But optimism is equally essential. The belief that things can be, and will be, better even when the evidence is murky is one of the most essential parts of everything from maintaining a sound relationship to making a long- term investment.
A big thing to know about how people think is that progress requires optimism and pessimism to coexist.</p>
    
    <p>
They seem like conflicting mindsets, so it’s more common for people to prefer one or the other. But knowing how to balance the two has always been, and always will be, one of life’s most important skills.
The best financial plan is to save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist. That idea—the belief that things will get better mixed with the reality that the path between now and then will be a continuous chain of setback, disappointment, surprise, and shock—shows up all over history, in all areas of life.</p>

— John McCain became the most famous Vietnam prisoner of war. But at the time, Admiral Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking POW.
Stockdale was tortured routinely, and at one point attempted suicide out of fear he might break and give up sensitive military information.
Decades after he was released, Stockdale was asked in an interview about how depressing life in prison must have been.</p>
