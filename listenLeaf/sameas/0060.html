    <p> What happened —and I can say this only with hindsight—was a bunch of small risks colliding and multiplying at once.
A new virus transferred to humans (something that has happened forever), and those humans interacted with other people (of course). It was a mystery for a while (understandable), and then bad news was likely suppressed (bad, but common). Other countries thought it would be contained (standard denial) and didn’t act fast enough (bureaucracy).</p>
    
    <p> We weren’t prepared (overoptimism) and could respond only with blunt-force lockdowns (panic, do what you gotta do).
None of those on their own are surprising. But combined they turned into a disaster.
The Tenerife airport disaster in 1977 is the deadliest aircraft accident in history.</p>
    
    <p> The error was stunning. One plane took off while another was still on the runway, and the two Boeing 747s collided, killing 583 people on a runway on the Spanish island.
In the aftermath authorities wondered how such an egregious catastrophe could occur. One postmortem study explained exactly how: “Eleven separate coincidences and mistakes, most of them minor  .</p>
    
    <p>  .  . had to fall precisely into place” for the crash to occur. Lots of tiny mistakes added up to a huge one.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s good to always assume the world will break about once per decade,
because historically it has. The breakages feel like low-probability events,
so it’s common to think they won’t keep happening. But they do, again and again, because they’re actually just smaller high-probability events compounding off one another.
That isn’t intuitive, so we’ll discount big risks like we always have.</p>
    
    <p>
And of course, the same thing happens in the other direction.
— The most astounding force in the universe is obvious. It’s evolution. The thing that developed single-cell organisms into humans who can read this book on an iPad with a terabyte of storage.</p>
    
    <p> The thing that’s responsible for 20/20 vision and flying birds and immune systems.
Nothing else in science can blow your mind more than what evolution has accomplished.
Biologist Leslie Orgel used to say, “Evolution is cleverer than you are,” because whenever a critic says, “Evolution could never do that,” they usually just lacked imagination.
It’s also easy to underestimate because of basic math.</p>
    
    <p>
Evolution’s superpower is not just selecting favorable traits. That part is so tedious, and if it’s all you focus on you’ll be skeptical and confused.
Most species’ change in any millennia is so trivial it’s unnoticeable.
The real magic of evolution is that it’s been selecting traits for 3.</p>
