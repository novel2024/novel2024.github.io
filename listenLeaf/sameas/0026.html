    <p>9 million in the New Jersey lottery in 1986. Four months later she won again, collecting another $1.4 million.
‘‘I’m going to quit playing,’’ she told The New York Times.</p>
    
    <p> ‘‘I’m going to give everyone else a chance.’’ It was a big story at the time, because number crunchers put the odds of her double win at a staggering 1 in 17 trillion.
Three years later two mathematicians, Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller, threw cold water on the excitement.
If one person plays the lottery, the odds of picking the winning numbers twice are indeed 1 in 17 trillion.</p>
    
    <p>
But if one hundred million people play the lottery week after week— which is the case in America—the odds that someone will win twice are actually quite good. Diaconis and Mosteller figured it was 1 in 30.
That number didn’t make many headlines.
‘‘With a large enough sample, any outrageous thing is apt to happen,” Mosteller said.</p>
    
    <p>
That’s part of why the world seems so crazy, and why once-in-a-lifetime events seem to happen regularly.
There are about eight billion people on this planet. So if an event has a one-in-a-million chance of occurring every day, it should happen to eight thousand people a day, or 2.9 million times a year, and maybe a quarter of a billion times during your lifetime.</p>
    
    <p> Even a one-in-a-billion event will become the fate of hundreds of thousands of people during your lifetime.
And given the news media’s insatiable appetite for shocking headlines, the odds are nearly 100 percent that you will hear about these events when they happen.
Physicist Freeman Dyson once explained that what’s often attributed to the supernatural, or magic, or miracles, is actually just basic math.
In any normal person’s life, miracles should occur at the rate of roughly one per month: The proof of the law is simple.</p>
    
    <p> During the time that we are awake and actively engaged in living our lives, roughly for eight hours each day, we see and hear things happening at a rate of one per second. So the total number of events that happen to us is about 30,000 per day, or about a million per month.
If the chance of a “miracle” is one in a million, we should therefore experience one per month, on average.
The idea that incredible things happen because of boring statistics is important, because it’s true for terrible things too.</p>
    
    <p>
Think about one-hundred-year events. One-hundred-year floods,
hurricanes, earthquakes, financial crises, frauds, pandemics, political meltdowns, economic recessions, and so on endlessly. Lots of terrible things can be called one-hundred-year events.
A one-hundred-year event doesn’t mean it happens every one hundred years.</p>
    
    <p> It means there’s about a 1 percent chance of it occurring in any given year. That seems low. But when there are hundreds of different independent one-hundred-year events, what are the odds that one of them will occur in a given year?
Pretty good.
If next year there’s a 1 percent chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1 percent chance of a crippling depression, a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1 percent chance of political collapse, and on and on,
then the odds that something bad will happen next year—or any year— are .</p>
