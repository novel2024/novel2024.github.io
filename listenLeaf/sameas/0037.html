Reality didn’t matter.
Historian Stephen Ambrose notes that Eisenhower and General Omar Bradley got all the war-planning reasoning and logic right in late 1944,
except for one detail—the extent to which Hitler had lost his mind.
An aide to Bradley mentioned during the war: “If we were fighting reasonable people they would have surrendered long ago.” But they weren’t, and it—the one thing that was hard to measure with logic— mattered more than anything.</p>

— Archibald Hill ran every morning, starting on a track at 7:15. He was good at it—a great athlete and competitive runner.
Hill, a British physiologist born in 1886, was in many ways a perfect scientist, because he devoted most of his career to answering a question he was personally interested in and could test on himself: How fast and how far can people run?
Given my body, or your body, or Hill’s own body, what’s the theoretical limit to how much we can push ourselves? That’s the question he wanted to answer.
Hill’s early work was based on the idea that maximum running performance is a function of an athlete’s muscles—overwhelmingly their heart.</p>
    
    <p> If my heart can pump more blood to my running muscles than yours,
I can run faster. It was something you could cleanly measure, and Hill won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1922 for some of his work in understanding body mechanics.
The idea that you can measure the limit of how fast someone can run made sense, and in the laboratory and on the test track it more or less holds up.
On the racetrack, in the real world, it’s a different story.</p>
    
    <p> Hill’s calculations had almost zero ability to predict race winners.
If the best competitive athletes merely had the strongest hearts and the greatest capacity to transport oxygen, finding and knowing who will be the best athlete would be straightforward.
But it’s not.
Great athletes are more likely to have stronger hearts than a couch potato.</p>
    
    <p> But the correlation between cardiovascular capacity and athletic performance is far from perfect, which is why competitive races like marathons and Olympic sprints are exciting. Sometimes great athletes choke. Sometimes dark horses win.
Hill, once wedded to the idea that running performance should be tied solely to muscular ability, was stumped.</p>
    
    <p> Asked why his initial calculations of athletic ability were of little use at predicting race winners, he responded:
“To tell you the truth, we don’t do it because it is useful, but because it’s amusing.” But he eventually figured out what was going on, and it changed how scientists think about athletic performance forever.
Athletic performance isn’t just what you’re physically capable of. It’s what you’re capable of within the context of what your brain is willing to endure for the risk and reward in a given moment.</p>
    
    <p>
Your brain’s first job is to make sure you don’t die. So like a speed governor on a car, it won’t let you exert true maximum performance— which could leave you exhausted to the point of being vulnerable—unless the stakes are high enough. It will shut you down at a lower physical “limit” if the risk of exertion isn’t worth the reward.
Physical running limits on a test track may be different than physical limits during an Olympic final, which may be different than physical limits when being chased by an ax murderer.</p>
    
    <p>
This helps explain crazy stories about people lifting up cars when someone is pinned underneath, their life in jeopardy. Capabilities are a function of in-the-moment circumstances.
In his early days, Hill wrote that “our bodies are machines, whose energy expenditures may be closely measured.” Later on, as his views came around to a more nuanced view of human performance, he noted that “there is more in athletics than sheer chemistry.</p>
