    <p> . . not bad.
It’s always been like that.</p>
    
    <p> Even periods that we remember as stretches of good times were pockmarked with chaos. The glorious 1950s were actually a continuous chain of grief: Adjusted for population growth, more Americans lost their jobs during the 1958 recession than did in any single month during the Great Recession of 2008. Same with the 1990s: We remember it as a calm decade, but the global financial system nearly fell apart in 1998, during the greatest prosperity boom we’ve ever seen.
What’s different now is the size of the global economy, which increases the sample size of potential crazy things that might happen.</p>
    
    <p> When eight billion people interact, the odds of a fraudster, a genius, a terrorist, an idiot,
a savant, a jerk, or a visionary moving the needle in a significant way on any given day is nearly guaranteed.
There have been roughly 100 billion humans to ever live. With an average age of roughly 30 years, individual humans have lived something like 1.2 quadrillion days (or 1.</p>
    
    <p>2 million billion). Crazy things that have a one-in-a-billion chance of happening have occurred millions of times.
But the problem is far worse now than it’s ever been, and will almost certainly continue getting worse.
Frederick Lewis Allen describes how Americans stayed informed in the year 1900:
It is hard for us today to realize how very widely communities were separated from one another.</p>
    
    <p>  .  .  . To some extent a Maine fisherman, an Ohio farmer, and a Chicago businessman would be able to discuss politics with one another,
but in the absence of syndicated newspaper columns appearing from coast to coast their information would be based mostly upon what they had read in very divergent local newspapers.</p>
    
    <p>
Information was harder to disseminate over distances, and what was going on in other parts of the country or the world just wasn’t your top concern; information was local because life was local.
Radio changed that in a big way. It connected people to a common source of information.
TV did it even more.</p>
    
    <p>
The internet took it to the next level.
Social media blew it up by orders of magnitude.
Digital news has by and large killed local newspapers and made information global. Eighteen hundred U.</p>
    
    <p>S. print media outlets disappeared between 2004 and 2017.
The decline of local news has all kinds of implications. One that doesn’t get much attention is that the wider the news becomes the more likely it is to be pessimistic.</p>
