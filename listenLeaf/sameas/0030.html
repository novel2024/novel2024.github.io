    <p>” The same thing happens in many parts of life. Take the stock market.
You can show people that the market historically crashes every five to seven years. But every five to seven years people say, “This is wrong, this feels broken, my advisor screwed up.</p>
    
    <p>” Knowing the high odds of something happening loses its meaning when that thing happening hurts. Probability goes out the window.
What you always want to avoid are catastrophic risks. A pilot who crashes once every ten thousand flights is a catastrophe.</p>
    
    <p> But our difficulty dealing with probability and large numbers makes us overly sensitive to run-of-the-mill, inevitable risks.
Same as ever.
— In the next chapter, we’ll look at a little-known fact about Martin Luther King Jr.’s most famous speech and at the incredible power of stories.</p>

T Best Story Wins Stories are always more powerful than statistics.
he best story wins.
Not the best idea, or the right idea, or the most rational idea. Just whoever tells a story that catches people’s attention and gets them to nod their heads is the one who tends to be rewarded.</p>
    
    <p>
Great ideas explained poorly can go nowhere, while old or wrong ideas told compellingly can ignite a revolution. Morgan Freeman can narrate a grocery list and bring people to tears, while an inarticulate scientist might cure a disease and go unnoticed.
There is too much information in the world for everyone to calmly sift through the data, looking for the most rational, most correct answer. People are busy and emotional, and a good story is always more powerful and persuasive than ice-cold statistics.</p>
    
    <p>
If you have the right answer, you may or may not get ahead.
If you have the wrong answer but you’re a good storyteller, you’ll probably get ahead (for a while).
If you have the right answer and you’re a good storyteller, you’ll almost certainly get ahead.
That’s always been true, always will be true, and it shows up in so many areas of history.</p>

— Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, did not go according to plan.
King’s advisor and speechwriter, Clarence Jones, drafted a full speech for King to deliver, based on, he recalled, a “summary of ideas we had talked about.” The first few minutes of King’s speech followed the script.</p>
    
    <p> Video shows him constantly looking down at his notes, reading verbatim. “Go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.” Just then, around halfway through the speech, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson—who was standing to King’s left, maybe ten feet away—shouts out, “Tell ’em about the dream, Martin! Tell ’em about the dream!” Jones recalled: “[King] looks over at her in real time, then he takes the text of the written speech and he slides it to the left side of the lectern. He grabs the lectern and looks out on more than 250,000 people.</p>
