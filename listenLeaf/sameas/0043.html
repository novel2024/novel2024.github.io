    <p> Mumps, measles, chicken pox, and German measles swept through entire schools and towns; I had all four. Polio took a heavy annual toll, leaving thousands of people (mostly children) paralyzed or dead. There were no vaccines. Growing up meant running an unavoidable gauntlet of infectious disease.</p>
    
    <p>
Compare this to my generation—who benefit from a half dozen vaccines within weeks of birth—and it’s like we live in separate worlds. I can’t fathom what was normal two generations ago.
My guess is if COVID-19 struck the world in 1920, it would be a single page in the history books about yet another deadly pandemic wedged in between a long list of common tragedies. But since it struck in the comparative calm of 2020, it will leave a mark that reshapes how some people think about viral risk.</p>
    
    <p>
The odd thing to ponder is the Hyman Minsky version of this development.
Did a lack of pandemics over the last fifty years make the world more vulnerable to COVID-19? Did the decline of infectious disease death make us underestimate the odds that it could happen in modern times?
Part of what made COVID dangerous is that we got so good at preventing pandemics in the last century that few people before 2020 assumed an infectious disease would ever impact their lives. It was hard to comprehend. So people were utterly unprepared for a pandemic when it arrived.</p>
    
    <p> The irony of good times is that they breed complacency and skepticism of warnings.
Epidemiologists had been warning something like COVID could happen for years—but mostly to deaf ears and a public that assumed pandemics were something that happened only in history books and other parts of the world. It’s hard to convince someone they’re in danger of a risk they assume has been defeated.
“As public health did its job, it became a target” of budget cuts, Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of Health Officials, said in 2020.</p>
    
    <p>
Calm planted the seeds of crazy. And that happens so often.
A common irony goes like this:
• Paranoia leads to success because it keeps you on your toes.
• But paranoia is stressful, so you abandon it quickly once you achieve success.</p>
    
    <p>
• Now you’ve abandoned what made you successful and you begin to decline—which is even more stressful.
It happens in business, investing, careers, relationships—all over the place.
— Carl Jung had a theory called enantiodromia. It’s the idea that an excess of something gives rise to its opposite.</p>
    
    <p>
Let me give you an example from Mother Nature.
California was hit with an epic drought in the mid-2010s. Then 2017 came, dropping a preposterous amount of moisture. Parts of Lake Tahoe received—I’m not making this up—more than sixty-five feet of snow in a few months.</p>
    
    <p> The six-year drought was declared over.
You’d think that would be great. But it backfired in an unexpected way.
Record rain in 2017 led to record vegetation growth that summer.</p>
