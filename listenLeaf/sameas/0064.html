    <p> They think everything is terrible, will always be terrible, and see all positivity as a character flaw.
Part is rooted in ego: they have so little confidence in themselves they can’t fathom anything going right. They’re the polar opposite of the pure optimist, and just as detached from reality.
Both are equally dangerous, but either can seem the most logical if you view optimism and pessimism as black-and-white, like you need to be one or the other.</p>
    
    <p>
In the middle is the sweet spot, what I call the rational optimists: those who acknowledge that history is a constant chain of problems and disappointments and setbacks, but who remain optimistic because they know setbacks don’t prevent eventual progress. They sound like hypocrites and flip-floppers, but often they’re just looking further ahead than other people.
— The trick in any field—from finance to careers to relationships—is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth.
Save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist.</p>
    
    <p>
Plan like a pessimist and dream like an optimist.
Those can seem like conflicting skills. And they are. It’s intuitive to think you should either be an optimist or a pessimist.</p>
    
    <p> It’s hard to realize there’s a time and a place for both, and that the two can—and should— coexist. But it’s what you see in almost every successful long-term endeavor.
The business that takes huge risks with new products, like an optimist,
but is terrified of short-term debt and always wants a big chunk of safety- net cash, like a pessimist.
The worker who turns down a lucrative opportunity because it might come at the expense of their reputation, which over the long run is far more valuable.</p>
    
    <p>
Same in investing. I wrote in my book The Psychology of Money: “More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.” An important lesson from history is that the long run is usually pretty good and the short run is usually pretty bad.</p>
    
    <p> It takes effort to reconcile those two and learn how to manage them with what seem like conflicting skills.
Those who can’t usually end up either bitter pessimists or bankrupt optimists.
Moving right along. Now let’s discuss another topic that’s not intuitive:
The more perfect you try to be, the worse you’ll end up doing.</p>
    
    <p>
P Casualties of Perfection There is a huge advantage to being a little imperfect.
eople don’t like to leave opportunities on the table. A common urge is to squeeze out as much efficiency and perfection as you can from whatever you’re pursuing. It feels like the right thing to do, like you’re maximizing your chances of success.</p>
    
    <p>
But there’s a common downside to perfection that’s so easy to overlook.
— The key thing about evolution is that everything dies. Ninety-nine percent of species are already extinct; the rest will be eventually.
There is no perfect species, one adapted to everything at all times.</p>
