    <p> But as the spacecraft hovered over the moon, Michael Collins turned to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and said:
It’s amazing how quickly you adapt. It doesn’t seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?
Three months later, after Al Bean walked on the moon during Apollo 12,
he turned to astronaut Pete Conrad and said, “It’s kind of like the song: Is that all there is?” Conrad was relieved, because he secretly felt the same,
describing his moonwalk as spectacular but not momentous.
Expectations also shift and goalposts move faster than you can imagine.
Collins once said of Aldrin: “I think he resents not being first on the moon more than he appreciates being second.</p>
    
    <p>” I don’t think I’ve met, or know of, anyone with outsize success who gained as much happiness as an outsider might expect. That doesn’t mean success can’t bring pride or contentment or independence. But it’s rarely what you thought it would be before achieving it.
Jim Carrey once said, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.</p>
    
    <p>” Part of this is the same reason that predicting how you’ll respond to risk is difficult: It’s hard to imagine the full context until you experience it firsthand.
If you think of your future self living in a new mansion, you imagine basking in splendor and everything feeling great. What’s easy to forget is that people in mansions can get the flu, have psoriasis, become embroiled in lawsuits, bicker with their spouses, feel wracked with insecurity and annoyed with politicians—which in any given moment can supersede any joy that comes from material success. Future fortunes are imagined in a vacuum, but reality is always lived with the good and bad taken together,
competing for attention.</p>

You might think you know how it’ll feel. Then you experience it firsthand and you realize, ah, okay. It’s more complicated than you thought.
Now you get it.</p>

Next, let’s talk about the long run.
L Time Horizons Saying “I’m in it for the long run” is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top, and saying, “That’s where I’m heading.” Well, that’s nice.
Now comes the test.</p>

Nothing will ever separate us. We will probably be married another ten years.
—ELIZABETH TAYLOR, FIVE DAYS BEFORE FILING FOR DIVORCE ong-term thinking is easier to believe in than to accomplish.
Most people know it’s the right strategy in investing, careers,
relationships—anything that compounds.</p>
    
    <p> But saying “I’m in it for the long run” is a bit like standing at the base of Mount Everest, pointing to the top,
and saying, “That’s where I’m heading.” Well, that’s nice. Now comes the test.
Long term is harder than most people imagine, which is why it’s more lucrative than many people assume.</p>
    
    <p>
Everything worthwhile has a price, and the prices aren’t always obvious.
The real price of long term—the skills required, the mentality needed—is easy to minimize and often summarized with simple phrases like “Be more patient,” as if that explains why so many people can’t.
To do long term effectively you have to understand a few points.
The long run is just a collection of short runs you have to put up with.</p>
