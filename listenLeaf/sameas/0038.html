    <p>” There was a behavioral and psychological side that was much harder to measure.
You never know how an athlete can perform until you put them in the heat of the moment, with the pressures, risks, and incentives of real-world conditions that can’t be emulated in the laboratory.
Hill, in an interesting coincidence, was married to John Maynard Keynes’s sister.
Keynes, the British economist, had discovered in his work that economies are not machines.</p>
    
    <p> They have souls, emotions, and feelings.
Keynes called them “animal spirits.” Hill discovered the same, but for our bodies. He called them “moral factors.</p>
    
    <p>” Our bodies are not machines, and we shouldn’t expect them to perform as such. They have feelings, emotions, and fears, all of which regulate what we’re capable of.
All of which are very hard to measure.
— Investor Jim Grant once said:
To suppose that the value of a common stock is determined purely by a corporation’s earnings discounted by the relevant interest rates and adjusted for the marginal tax rate is to forget that people have burned witches, gone to war on a whim, risen to the defense of Joseph Stalin and believed Orson Welles when he told them over the radio that the Martians had landed.</p>
    
    <p>
That’s always been the case. And it will always be the case.
Every investment price, every market valuation, is just a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.
The numbers are easy to measure, easy to track, easy to formulate.</p>
    
    <p> It’s getting easier as almost everyone has cheap access to information.
But the stories are often bizarre reflections of people’s hopes, dreams,
fears, insecurities, and tribal affiliations. And they’re getting more bizarre as social media amplifies the most emotionally appealing views.
A few examples of how powerful this can be:
Lehman Brothers was in great shape on September 10, 2008.</p>
    
    <p> Its tier 1 capital ratio—a measure of a bank’s ability to endure loss—was 11.7 percent. That was higher than the previous quarter. Higher than Goldman Sachs.</p>
    
    <p> Higher than Bank of America. It was more capital than Lehman had in 2007, when the banking industry was about as strong as it had ever been.
Seventy-two hours later Lehman was bankrupt.
The only thing that changed during those three days was investors’ faith in the company.</p>
    
    <p> One day they believed in the company and bought its debt.
The next day that belief stopped, and so did its funding.
That faith is the only thing that mattered. But it was the one thing that was hard to quantify, hard to model, hard to predict, and didn’t compute in a traditional valuation model.</p>
