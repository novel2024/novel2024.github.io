    <p> During a three-hour session, the consultant walked us through hashtags, what time of day you should post on Twitter, how threading posts increases engagement, and a slew of other hacks.
He was nice. But he never mentioned the most effective social media trick: write good stuff that people want to read.
That’s because writing good stuff isn’t a hack.</p>
    
    <p> It’s hard. It takes time and creativity. It can’t be manufactured. It works, with a near 100 percent success rate.</p>
    
    <p> But it is the social media equivalent of a heavy workout.
Same goes for diets, finances, marketing . . .</p>
    
    <p> everyone wants a shortcut.
It’s always been this way, but I suspect it’s getting worse as technology inflates our benchmark for how fast results should happen.
Hacks are appealing because they look like paths to prizes without the effort. But in the real world, those rarely exist.</p>

Charlie Munger once noted: “The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.</p>
    
    <p>” In 1990, David Letterman asked his friend Jerry Seinfeld how his new sitcom was going.
Jerry said there was one frustrating problem: NBC supplied the show with teams of comedy writers, and he didn’t think he was getting much good material from them.
“Wouldn’t it be weirder if they were good?” David asked.
“What do you mean?” Jerry asked.</p>
    
    <p>
“Wouldn’t it be strange if they could all just produce reams of hilarious material day after day?” Recalling the conversation, Seinfeld laughed and told Letterman: “It’s supposed to be hard.” Of course it is. The reason someone like Jerry Seinfeld, or Michael Jordan, or Serena Williams is so famous is because there is only one of them. What they’ve accomplished is unfathomably hard, and that is what we admire.</p>

Harvard Business Review once pointed out to Jerry Seinfeld that part of the reason he ended his show was writer burnout. The magazine asked if he and show cocreator Larry David could have avoided burnout and kept the show going if they used a consulting company like McKinsey to create a more efficient writing process.
Seinfeld asked if McKinsey is funny.
No, the magazine said.</p>
