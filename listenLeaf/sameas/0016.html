It’s been like this forever. Montesquieu wrote 275 years ago, “If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.” John D. Rockefeller never had penicillin, sunscreen, or Advil.</p>
    
    <p> But you can’t say a low-income American with Advil and sunscreen today should feel better off than Rockefeller, because that’s not how people’s heads work.
People gauge their well-being relative to those around them, and luxuries become necessities in a remarkably short period of time when the people around you become better off.
Investor Charlie Munger once noted that the world isn’t driven by greed;
it’s driven by envy.
Let me show you what he means, with a little story about the 1950s.</p>
    
    <p>
— “The present and immediate future seem astonishingly good,” Life magazine’s January 1953 cover story begins.
“The country has just lived through what was economically the greatest year in its history,” it went on. It had done this with “10 straight years of full employment, through new management attitudes which include an increasing realization that the well-paid worker, who does his job under healthy and agreeable conditions, is a valuable worker.” Wealth came so fast to so many that it was jarring.</p>
    
    <p> “In the 1930s I worried about how I could eat,” Life quotes one taxi driver. “Now I’m worrying about where to park.” If these quotes don’t surprise you, it’s because the 1950s are so often remembered as the golden age of middle-class prosperity. Ask Americans when the country was at its greatest and the 1950s is usually near the top.</p>

Compared to today? Different worlds, no comparison. The overwhelming feeling is: It was better then.
There is a common nostalgic vision of a typical American life in the 1950s. George Friedman, a geopolitical forecaster, once summarized:
In the 1950s and 1960s, the median income allowed you to live with a single earner—normally the husband, with the wife typically working as a homemaker—and roughly three children.</p>
    
    <p>
It permitted the purchase of modest tract housing, one late model car and an older one. It allowed a driving vacation somewhere and, with care, some savings as well.
This version of the 1950s lifestyle is true in the sense that the median American family indeed had three kids and a dog named Spot and a breadwinning husband who worked at the factory, on and on.
But the idea that the typical family was better off then than now—that they were more prosperous and more secure, by nearly any metric—is easy to debunk.</p>
    
    <p>
Median family income adjusted for inflation was $29,000 in 1955. In 1965 it was $42,000. In 2021 it was $70,784.
Life described the 1950s as prosperous in a way that would have seemed unbelievable to someone living in the 1920s.</p>
    
    <p> The same is true today—a 1950s family would have found it unfathomable that their grandchildren would earn more than twice as much as they did.
And higher income wasn’t due to working more hours, or entirely due to women joining the workforce in greater numbers. Median hourly wages adjusted for inflation are nearly 50 percent higher today than in 1955.
Some of today’s economic worries would have puzzled a 1950s family.</p>
