    <p>” Hollings replied, “The American people don’t care about the ten. They care about the one.” Ho Chi Minh once put it more bluntly, allegedly stating: “You will kill ten of us, and we will kill one of you, but it is you who will tire first.” It’s hard to contextualize that on a chart.</p>

Some things are immeasurably important. They’re either impossible, or too elusive, to quantify. But they can make all the difference in the world,
often because their lack of quantification causes people to discount their relevance or even deny their existence.
Carved on the wall at University of Chicago is a quote from Lord Kelvin that says, “When you cannot measure, your knowledge is meager and unsatisfactory.</p>
    
    <p>” He’s not wrong, but the danger is assuming that if something can’t be measured it doesn’t matter. The opposite is true: Some of the most important forces in the world—particularly those regarding people’s personalities and mindsets—are nearly impossible to measure and impossible to predict.
Jeff Bezos once said, “The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There’s something wrong with the way you are measuring it.</p>
    
    <p>” I love and hate that quote in equal parts, because I know it’s true but I don’t want it to be. You see its wisdom so often in history.
The Battle of the Bulge was one of the deadliest American military battles of all time. Nineteen thousand American soldiers were killed,
another seventy thousand wounded or missing, in just over a month as Nazi Germany made an ill-fated final push against the Allies.</p>
    
    <p>
Part of the reason it was so bloody is that Americans were surprised.
And part of the reason they were surprised is that in the rational minds of American generals, it made no sense for Germany to attack.
The Germans didn’t have enough troops to mount a successful counterattack, and the few that were left were often children under age eighteen with no combat experience. They didn’t have enough fuel.</p>
    
    <p> They were running out of food. The terrain of the Ardennes Forest in Belgium stacked the odds against them. The weather was atrocious.
The Allies knew all this.</p>
    
    <p> They reasoned that any rational German commander would not launch a counterattack. So the American lines were left fairly thin and ill-supplied.
And then, boom. The Germans attacked anyway.</p>
    
    <p>
What the American generals overlooked was how unhinged Hitler had become. He wasn’t rational. He was living in his own world, detached from reality and reason. When his generals asked where they should get fuel to complete the attack, Hitler said they could steal it from the Americans.</p>
