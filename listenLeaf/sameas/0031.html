    <p>” There’s then a six-second pause before King looks up at the sky and says:
I have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>
    
    <p>
I have a dream today!
The rest was history.
Jones said, “That portion of the speech which is most celebrated in this country and around the world is not the speech that he planned to give.” It wasn’t what King prepared. It wasn’t what he and his speechwriter assumed would be the best material for that day.</p>

But it was one of the best stories ever told, evoking emotion and connecting the dots in millions of people’s heads in a way that changed history.
Good stories tend to do that. They have extraordinary ability to inspire and evoke positive emotions, bringing insight and attention to topics that people tend to ignore when they’ve previously been presented with nothing but facts.
Mark Twain was perhaps the best storyteller of modern times.</p>
    
    <p> When editing his writing, he would read aloud to his wife and kids. When a passage caused them to look bored, he would cut it. When their eyes widened, when they sat forward or furrowed their brow, he knew he was onto something, and he doubled down.
Even within a good story, a powerful phrase or sentence can do most of the work.</p>
    
    <p> There is a saying that people don’t remember books; they remember sentences.
— C. R. Hallpike is an anthropologist who once wrote a review of a young author’s new book on the history of humans.</p>
    
    <p> The review states:
It would be fair to say that whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously. . . .</p>
    
    <p> [It is not] a contribution to knowledge.
Two things are notable here.
One is that the author, Yuval Noah Harari, has sold over twenty-eight million books, making him one of the bestselling contemporary authors in any field, and his book Sapiens—which Hallpike was reviewing—is the most successful anthropology book of all time.
The other is that Harari doesn’t seem to disagree with Hallpike’s assessment.</p>
    
    <p>
Harari once said about writing Sapiens:
I thought, “This is so banal!” . . . There is absolutely nothing there that is new.</p>
