    <p> I’m not an archeologist. I’m not a primatologist. I mean, I did zero new research. .</p>
    
    <p> . . It was really reading the kind of common knowledge and just presenting it in a new way.
What Sapiens does have is excellent writing.</p>
    
    <p> Beautiful writing. The stories are captivating, the flow is effortless. Harari took what was already known and wrote it better than anyone had done before. The result was fame greater than anyone before him could imagine.</p>
    
    <p> Best story wins.
It’s nothing to be ashamed of, because so many successes work this way.
The Civil War is probably the most well-documented period in American history. There are thousands of books analyzing every conceivable angle,
chronicling every possible detail.</p>
    
    <p> But in 1990 Ken Burns’s The Civil War documentary became an instant phenomenon, with forty million viewers and winning forty major television and film awards. As many Americans watched Ken Burns’s The Civil War in 1990 as watched the Super Bowl that year.
And all Burns did—not to minimize it, because it’s such a feat—is take 130-year-old existing information and weave it into a (very) good story.
Burns once described perhaps the most important part of his storytelling process—the music that accompanies images in his documentaries:
I went into old hymnals and old song books and I had someone plunk them out on the piano.</p>
    
    <p> And whenever something hit me I’d go, “That one!” And then we’d go into a studio with a session musician and probably do thirty different recordings.
Burns says that when writing a documentary script he will literally extend a sentence so that it lines up with a certain beat in the background music; he will cut a sentence to do the same. “Music is God,” he says. “It’s not just the icing on the cake.</p>
    
    <p> It’s the fudge, baked right in there.” Now imagine you’re a world-class historian who has spent decades uncovering new and groundbreaking information about an important topic.
How much time do you spend thinking about whether a specific sentence of what you’ve discovered will match the beat of a song? Probably none. Ken Burns does.</p>
    
    <p> And that is why he’s a household name.
Author Bill Bryson is the same. His books fly off the shelves, which can drive the little-known academics who uncovered the things he writes about crazy. One of his books—The Body: A Guide for Occupants—is basically an anatomy textbook.</p>
