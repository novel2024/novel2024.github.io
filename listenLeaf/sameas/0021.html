    <p> Abdi and Nageeye later explained that they did what anyone else would do—they pulled out their cell phones, found a Wi-Fi network, and aimlessly scrolled social media.
Kipchoge didn’t.
Abdi and Nageeye said he just sat there, staring at the wall, in perfect silence and contentment.
For hours.</p>
    
    <p>
“He is not human,” Abdi joked.
He is not human.
He doesn’t think, act, or behave like an ordinary person.
Some variation of that phrase can be used for most of your role models.</p>
    
    <p>
You like them because they do things other people would never consider or can’t even comprehend.
Some of those traits are awesome, and you should look up to them,
maybe even try to emulate.
Others aren’t. Many aren’t.</p>
    
    <p>
Something that’s built into the human condition is that people who think about the world in unique ways you like almost certainly also think about the world in unique ways you won’t like.
It’s so easy to overlook, and it causes us to have poor judgment about who we should look up to and what we should expect from very successful people.
The key thing is that unique minds have to be accepted as a full package,
because the things they do well and that we admire cannot be separated from the things we wouldn’t want for ourselves or we look down upon.
Let me tell you a quick story about a fighter pilot whom everyone needed but no one could stand.</p>
    
    <p>
— John Boyd was probably the greatest fighter pilot to ever live.
He revolutionized his field more than anyone before or since. A manual he wrote, Aerial Attack Study, incorporated as much math into the science of fighting maneuvers as engineers used in building the planes.
His insights were simple but powerful.</p>
    
    <p> In one, Boyd realized there was a tactical advantage not in how fast or high a plane could fly, but how quickly it could change course and begin climbing—a discovery that altered not only how pilots thought but how planes were built. He was as close to a flying savant as they come. Boyd’s manual, written in his twenties, became the official tactics guide of fighter pilots. It’s still used today.</p>
    
    <p>
Boyd is known as one of the most influential thinkers in military history.
Yet The New York Times once described him as “a virtual nonperson . . .</p>
    
    <p>
even in the Air Force.” That’s because as smart as Boyd was, he was a maniac.
He was rude. Erratic.</p>
