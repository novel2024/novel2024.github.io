    <p>” What makes incentives powerful is not just how they influence other people’s decisions but how blind we can be to how they impact our own.
Ben Franklin once wrote, “If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.” Incentives fuel stories that justify people’s actions and beliefs, offering comfort even when they’re doing things they know are wrong and believe things they know aren’t true.
James Clear put it this way: “People follow incentives, not advice.</p>
    
    <p>” — True story about a guy I knew well: A pizza delivery man who became a subprime mortgage banker in 2005.
Virtually overnight he could earn more per day than he earned per month delivering pizza. It completely changed his life.
Put yourself in his shoes.</p>
    
    <p> His job was to make loans. Feeding his family relied on making loans. And if he didn’t make those loans someone else would, so protesting or quitting felt pointless.
Everyone knew the subprime mortgage game was a joke in the mid- 2000s.</p>
    
    <p> Everyone knew it would end one day. But the bar for someone like my friend to say “This is unsustainable so I’m going to quit and deliver pizza again” is unbelievably high. It would be high for most of us. I didn’t blame him then, and I don’t blame him now.</p>
    
    <p>
A lot of bankers screwed up during the 2008 financial crisis. But too many of us underestimate how we ourselves would have acted if someone dangled enormous rewards in our face. Most people are blind to their own faults. To paraphrase Ben Franklin: Vice knows it’s ugly, so it hides behind a mask.</p>

This goes up the food chain, from the broker to the CEO, the investors,
the real estate appraiser, the realtor, the house flipper, the politician, the central banker—incentives lean heavily toward not rocking the boat. So everyone keeps paddling long after the market becomes unsustainable.
Sometimes the behaviors and outcomes are more extreme.
A documentary on the former Mexican drug lord El Chapo shows the poor village in Mexico where the violent, murderous cartel leader was extremely popular and supported by locals.</p>
    
    <p> They would do anything to protect him. One of them explained:
You’re talking about people who have almost no income. It was not uncommon for El Chapo to stop and talk to someone and say, “What’s going on in your life?” And the person would say,
“Oh, my daughter is getting married.” Chapo would say, “I’ll take care of it.</p>
    
    <p>” He’d get a big place, provide the band, provide the booze and food, and the whole town is invited. The father of the bride says, “Chapo made this possible.” In all these situations you have good, honest, well-meaning people who end up supporting or partaking in bad behavior because the incentives to play along are so strong. And in each situation there are more than just financial incentives.</p>
