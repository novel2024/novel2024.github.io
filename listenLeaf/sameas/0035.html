How many great ideas have already been discovered but could grow one hundred times or more if someone explained them better?
How many products have found only a fraction of their potential market because the companies that made them are so bad at describing them to customers?
So, so many.
Visa founder Dee Hock once said, “New ways of looking at things create much greater innovation than new ways of doing them.” You’ll get discouraged if you think every new book has to be about an original idea, or that every new company has to sell a brand-new invention.
There is so much more opportunity if you see the world like Yuval Noah Harari—that it’s not what you say or what you do, but how you say it and how you present it.</p>

Some of the most important questions to ask yourself are: Who has the right answer, but I ignore because they’re inarticulate? And what do I believe is true but is actually just good marketing?
They are uncomfortable questions and difficult to answer. But if you’re honest with yourself you’ll see how many people, and how many beliefs,
fall into these buckets. And then you’ll see the truth—that the best story wins.
— Next I’ll share another timeless truth: It has to do with war, fitness, stock markets, and other crazy things that cannot be measured.</p>

A Does Not Compute The world is driven by forces that cannot be measured.
lot of things don’t make any sense. The numbers don’t add up, the explanations are full of holes. And yet they keep happening—people making crazy decisions and reacting in bizarre ways that seem to defy rational thinking.</p>
    
    <p>
Most decisions aren’t made on a spreadsheet, where you just add up the numbers and a clear answer pops out. There’s a human element that’s hard to quantify and explain, and that can seem totally detached from the original goal, yet it carries more influence than anything else.
Historian Will Durant once said, “Logic is an invention of man and may be ignored by the universe.” And it often is, which can drive you mad if you expect the world to work in rational ways.</p>

Attempting to distill emotional and hormonal humans into a math equation is the cause of so much frustration and surprise in the world.
— Robert McNamara was hired by Henry Ford II to help turn Ford Motors around. Ford was losing money after World War II and needed a “whiz kid”—that’s what Henry Ford called it—who saw running a business as an operations science, driven by the ice-cold truth of statistics.
Later, McNamara took that skill to Washington when he became Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War.</p>
    
    <p> He demanded that everything be quantified, with daily, weekly, and monthly charts tracking the progress of every imaginable wartime statistic.
But the strategy that worked at Ford had a flaw when applied at the Department of Defense. Edward Lansdale, head of special operations at the Pentagon, once looked at McNamara’s numbers. He said something was missing.</p>
    
    <p>
“What?” McNamara asked.
“The feelings of the Vietnamese people,” Lansdale replied.
You couldn’t reduce that to a statistic or a chart.
This was a central issue with managing the Vietnam War.</p>
    
    <p> The difference between battle statistics brought to Washington and the feelings among those involved could be a million miles apart.
General Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. forces, told Senator Fritz Hollings, “We’re killing these people at a rate of ten to one.</p>
