Almost a quarter of Americans were out of work in 1932. The stock market fell 89 percent.
Those two economic stories dominate the decade’s attention, and they should.
But there’s another story about the 1930s that rarely gets mentioned: it was, by far, the most productive and technologically progressive decade in U.</p>
    
    <p>S. history.
The number of problems people solved, and the ways they discovered how to build stuff more efficiently, is a forgotten story of the ’30s that helps explain a lot of why the rest of the twentieth century was so prosperous.
Here are the numbers: total factor productivity—that’s economic output relative to the number of hours people worked and the amount of money invested in the economy—hit levels not seen before or since.</p>
    
    <p>
Economist Alex Field wrote that by 1941 the U.S. economy was producing 40 percent more output than it had in 1929, with virtually no increase in the total number of hours worked. Everyone simply became staggeringly more productive.</p>
    
    <p>
A couple of things happened during this period that are worth paying attention to, because they explain why this happened when it did.
Take cars. The 1920s was the era of the automobile. The number of cars on the road in America jumped from one million in 1912 to twenty-nine million by 1929.</p>
    
    <p>
But roads were a different story. Cars were sold in the 1920s faster than roads were built.
That changed in the 1930s when road construction, driven by the New Deal’s Public Works Administration, took off.
Spending on road construction went from 2 percent of GDP in 1920 to over 6 percent in 1933 (versus less than 1 percent today).</p>
    
    <p> The Department of Highway Transportation tells a story of how quickly projects began:
Construction began on August 5, 1933, in Utah on the first highway project under the act. By August 1934, 16,330 miles of new roadway projects were completed.
What this did to productivity is hard to overstate. The Pennsylvania Turnpike, as one example, cut travel times between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg by 70 percent.</p>
    
    <p> The Golden Gate Bridge, built in 1933, opened up Marin County, which had previously been accessible from San Francisco only by ferryboat.
Multiply those kinds of leaps across the nation and the 1930s was the decade that transportation blossomed in the United States. It was the last link that made the century-old railroad network truly efficient, creating last- mile service that connected the world.
Electrification also surged in the 1930s, particularly to rural Americans left out of the urban electrification of the 1920s.</p>
    
    <p>
The New Deal’s Rural Electrification Administration (REA) brought power to farms in what may have been the decade’s only positive development in regions that were economically devastated. The number of rural American homes with electricity rose from less than 10 percent in 1935 to nearly 50 percent by 1945.
It is hard to fathom, but it was not long ago—during some of our lifetimes and most of our grandparents’—that a substantial portion of America was literally dark. Franklin Roosevelt said in a speech on the REA:
Electricity is no longer a luxury.</p>
