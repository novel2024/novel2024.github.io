    <p> Show me a new technology that was immediately recognized for its full potential and instantly adopted by the masses. It doesn’t exist. A lot of pessimism is fueled by the fact that it often looks like we haven’t innovated in years—but that’s usually because it takes years to notice a new innovation. This is true even in hard sciences: Historian David Wooton says it took two hundred years from discovering germs to the medical acceptance that germs cause disease, another thirty years to discover antisepsis, and another sixty years before penicillin was in use.</p>
    
    <p>
Same for economic growth.
Real GDP per capita increased eightfold in the last hundred years.
America of the 1920s had the same real per-capita GDP as Turkmenistan does today. Our growth over the last century has been unbelievable.</p>
    
    <p> But GDP growth averages about 3 percent per year, which is easy to ignore in any given year, decade, or lifetime. Americans over age fifty have seen real GDP per person at least double since they were born. But people don’t remember the world when they were born. They remember the last few months, when progress is always invisible.</p>
    
    <p>
Same for careers, social progress, brands, companies, and relationships.
Progress always takes time, often too much time to even notice it’s happened.
But bad news?
It’s not shy or subtle. It comes instantly, so fast that it overwhelms your attention and you can’t look away.</p>
    
    <p>
Pearl Harbor and September 11 are probably the two biggest news events of the last hundred years. Both took about an hour to play out, start to finish.
It took less than thirty days for most people to go from never having heard of COVID-19 to it upending their life.
It took less than fifteen months for Lehman Brothers—a 158-year-old company—to go from an all-time high to bankrupt.</p>
    
    <p> Same with Enron,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Nokia, Bernie Madoff, Muammar Gaddafi,
Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Soviet Union. Things that thrived for decades can be ruined in minutes. There is no equivalent in the other direction.
There’s a good reason why.</p>
    
    <p>
Growth always fights against competition that slows its rise. New ideas fight for attention, business models fight incumbents, skyscrapers fight gravity. There’s always a headwind. But everyone gets out of the way of decline.</p>
    
    <p> Some might try to step in and slow the fall, but it doesn’t attract masses of outsiders who rush in to push back in the other direction the way progress does.
— Tens of billions of individual steps have to go right in the correct order to create a human. But only one thing has to happen to cause its demise.
After just five weeks a human embryo has a brain, a beating heart, a pancreas, a liver, and a gallbladder.</p>
