    <p> Our flight home was delayed because Lake Tahoe had been hit with a blizzard extreme even by its own standards.
You can’t ski race when there’s a blanket of new snow—racing requires hard-packed ice. So training was canceled, and Brendan, Bryan, and I prepared for a week of what we called free skiing: unstructured goofing off,
skiing around, and having a good time.
Earlier that month Tahoe received several feet of light, fluffy snow that comes from bitter-cold air.</p>
    
    <p> The storm that hit in mid-February was different. It was warm—barely at the freezing point—and powerful, leaving three feet of heavy, wet snow.
We didn’t think about it at the time, but the combination of heavy snow on top of fluffy snow creates textbook avalanche conditions. A light base of snow with a heavy layer on top is incredibly fragile and prone to sliding.</p>
    
    <p>
Ski resorts are pretty good at protecting customers from avalanches by closing off the most dangerous slopes and using explosives to intentionally set off avalanches late at night, before customers arrive in the morning.
But if you’re skiing out of bounds—ducking under the DO NOT CROSS ropes to ski the forbidden, untouched terrain—that system won’t help you.
On the morning of February 21, 2001, Brendan, Bryan, and I met in the Squaw Valley Ski Team locker room, like we had hundreds of times before.
Bryan’s last words when he left his house that morning were, “Don’t worry,
Mom, I won’t ski out of bounds.</p>
    
    <p>” But as soon as we clicked into our skis, that’s what we did.
— The backside of Squaw Valley (now called Palisades Tahoe), behind the KT-22 chairlift, is a stretch of mountain about a mile long that separates Squaw from Alpine Meadows ski resort.
It’s amazing skiing—steep and wide-open, with rolling terrain.
Before February 21 I had skied it maybe a dozen times.</p>
    
    <p> It wasn’t one of our frequent spots, because it takes so much time. It spits you out on a backcountry road, from where we would hitchhike back to our locker room.
Brendan, Bryan, and I decided to ski it that morning.
Within seconds of ducking under the out-of-bounds ropes, I remember getting caught in an avalanche.</p>
    
    <p>
I had never experienced one before, but it was unforgettable. I didn’t hear or see the slide. I just suddenly realized my skis weren’t on the ground anymore—I was literally floating in a cloud of snow. You have no control in these situations, because rather than you pushing the snow to gain traction with your skis, the snow is pushing you.</p>
    
    <p> The best you can do is keep your balance to remain upright.
The avalanche was small, and ended quickly.
“Did you see that avalanche?” I remember saying when we got to the road.
“Haha, that was awesome,” Brendan said.</p>
    
    <p>
We didn’t say another word about it as we hitchhiked back to our locker room.
— When we got back to Squaw, Brendan and Bryan said they wanted to ski the backside again.
I don’t know why, but I didn’t want to go.
But I had an idea.</p>
