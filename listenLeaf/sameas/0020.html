Same with expectations—they’re easy to ignore because their value isn’t on a price tag.
But your happiness completely relies on expectations.
Your boss’s impression of your career relies on them.
Consumer confidence relies on them.</p>
    
    <p>
What moves the stock market relies on them.
So why do we pay so little attention to them?
We spend so much effort trying to improve our income, skills, and ability to forecast the future—all good stuff worthy of our attention. But on the other side there’s an almost complete ignorance of expectations,
especially managing them with as much effort as we put into changing our circumstances.
Imagine a life where almost everything gets better but you never appreciate it because your expectations rise as fast as your circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s terrifying, and almost as bad as a world where nothing gets better.
When asked, “You seem extremely happy and content. What’s your secret to living a happy life?” ninety-eight-year-old Charlie Munger replied:
The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you’re going to be miserable your whole life.</p>
    
    <p> You want to have reasonable expectations and take life’s results, good and bad, as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism.
My friend Brent has a related theory about marriage: It only works when both people want to help their spouse while expecting nothing in return. If you both do that, you’re both pleasantly surprised.
These pieces of advice are easier said than done.</p>
    
    <p> I think it’s often hard to distinguish high expectations from motivation. And low expectations feels like giving up and minimizing your potential.
The only way around that might be recognizing two things.
One is the constant reminder that wealth and happiness is a two-part equation: what you have and what you expect/need.</p>
    
    <p> When you realize that each part is equally important, you see that the overwhelming attention we pay to getting more and the negligible attention we put on managing expectations makes little sense, especially because the expectations side can be so much more in your control.
The other is to understand how the expectation game is played. It’s a mental game, and it’s often crazy and agonizing, but it’s a game that everyone is forced to play, so you should be aware of the rules and strategies. It goes like this: You think you want progress, both for yourself and for the world.</p>
    
    <p> But most of the time that’s not actually what you want.
You want to feel a gap between what you expected and what actually happened. And the expectation side of that equation is not only important,
but it’s often more in your control than managing your circumstances.
Now let’s discuss one of the most complex topics in the world: people’s minds.</p>
    
    <p>
E Wild Minds People who think about the world in unique ways you like also think about the world in unique ways you won’t like.
liud Kipchoge, the world’s best marathon runner, was being held in a staging room during the 2021 Olympic Games in Tokyo. He and two other runners—Bashir Abdi from Belgium and Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands—were waiting to receive their Olympic medals after the marathon race, which Kipchoge won for the second time.
Logistics of the awards ceremony meant the runners would have to wait for several hours in a cramped, dull room with nothing to do but sit.</p>
