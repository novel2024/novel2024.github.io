    <p> Hard work is in pursuit of a goal, and once that goal is met the relaxation that feels so justified removes paranoia. This allows competitors and a changing world to creep in unnoticed.
A fourth is that a skill that’s valuable in one era may not extend to the next. You can work as hard and be as paranoid as you’ve always been, but if the world no longer values your skill, it’s a loss.</p>
    
    <p> Being a one-trick pony is common, because people and companies that are very good at one specific thing tend to be the highest paid during the boom.
The last is that some success is owed to being in the right place at the right time. The reversion to reality that unmasks good luck is often only obvious with hindsight, and is both humbling and tempting not to believe.
The idea that advantage has a shelf life is a fundamental part of growth.</p>
    
    <p>
It doesn’t have to be a tragedy—not all competitive advantages end like Sears. Great Britain lost the economic and military supremacy it held in the nineteenth century and remained a pretty nice place to live in the twentieth.
But competitive advantages tend to be short-lived, often because their success plants the seeds of their own decline.
— Leigh Van Valen was a crazy-looking evolutionary biologist who came up with a theory so wild no academic journal would publish it.</p>
    
    <p> So he created his own journal and published it, and the idea eventually became accepted wisdom.
Those kinds of ideas—counterintuitive, but ultimately true—are the ones worth paying most attention to, because they’re easiest to overlook.
For decades, scientists assumed that the longer a species had been around, the more likely it was to stick around, because age proved a strength that was likely to endure. Longevity was seen as both a trophy and a forecast.</p>
    
    <p>
In the early 1970s, Van Valen set out to prove that the conventional wisdom was right. But he couldn’t. The data just didn’t fit.
He began to wonder whether evolution was such a relentless and unforgiving force that long-lived species were just lucky.</p>
    
    <p> The data fit that theory better.
You’d think a new species discovering its niche would be fragile and susceptible to extinction—let’s say a 10 percent chance of extinction in a given period—while an old species had proven its might, and has, say, a 0.01 percent chance of extinction.
But when Van Valen plotted extinctions by a species’ age, the trend looked more like a straight line.</p>
    
    <p>
Some species survived a long time. But among groups of species, the probability of extinction was roughly the same whether it was 10,000 years old or 10 million years old.
In a 1973 paper titled “A New Evolutionary Law,” Van Valen wrote that “the probability of extinction of a taxon is effectively independent of its age.” If you take a thousand marbles and remove 2 percent of them each year,
some marbles will remain in the jar after twenty years.</p>
    
    <p> But the odds of being picked out are the same every year (2 percent). Marbles don’t get better at staying in the jar.
Species are the same. Some happen to live a long time, but the odds of surviving don’t improve over time.</p>
