But it’s always hard to know where anyone sits on that spectrum when they’ve carefully crafted an image of who they are. “The grass is always greener on the side that’s fertilized with bullshit,” the saying goes.
Occasionally a window into reality cracks open. Warren Buffett’s biography The Snowball revealed that the most-admired person in the investing industry has at times had a miserable family life—partly his own doing, the collateral damage of a life where picking stocks was the highest priority.</p>

Same for Bill and Melinda Gates, whose life looked fairy-tale charmed right up until the news of their nasty divorce. Elon Musk once broke down in tears when asked about the mental toll of Tesla’s struggles. “This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.</p>
    
    <p>” I grew up with a chronic stutter. People who have known me for years tend to say “I never knew you had a problem” when I tell them about it. It’s a well-meaning comment, but it actually highlights the issue. You didn’t know I stutter because I didn’t talk when I knew it would be difficult for me.</p>
    
    <p> You never know what struggles people are hiding. I’ve always wondered how many people I know are stutterers, but, like me, have kept it mostly hidden. And how many other issues are like that? Depression,
anxiety, phobias . .</p>
    
    <p> . so many things can be disguised in a way that places a facade of normalcy over a person’s internal struggles.
Back to the iceberg: What most of us see most of the time is a fraction of what has actually happened, or what’s going on inside people’s heads. And it’s stripped of all the hard parts.</p>

Most things are harder than they look and not as fun as they seem.
It leads to a few things:
When you are keenly aware of your own struggles but blind to those of others, it’s easy to assume you’re missing some skill or secret that others have. The more we describe successful people as having superhuman powers, the more everyone else looks at them and says, “I could never do that.” Which is unfortunate, because more people would be willing to try if they knew that those they admire are probably normal people who played the odds right.</p>
    
    <p>
When someone is viewed as more extraordinary than they are, you’re more likely to overvalue their opinion on things they have no special talent in. Like a successful hedge fund manager’s political views, or a politician’s investment advice. Only when you get to know someone well do you realize the best you can do in life is to become an expert at some things while remaining inept at others—and that’s if you’re good. There’s an important difference between someone whose specific talent should be celebrated versus someone whose ideas should never be questioned.</p>
    
    <p> Eat the orange, throw away the peel.
Everyone’s dealing with problems they don’t advertise, at least until you get to know them well. Keep that in mind and you become more forgiving —of yourself and others.
Next, an explanation of why good people do terrible things.</p>
