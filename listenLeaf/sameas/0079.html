It’s the same thing with innovation. At any given moment it’s easy to look around at what start-ups are building or what scientists are discovering and think that what we’re working on is maybe neat—at best—but pales in comparison to what we did yesterday. Since we never know how multiple innovations will collide, the path of least resistance is to conclude that our best days are behind us while ignoring the potential of what we’re working on.
One takeaway here is that it’s easy to always feel like we’re falling behind.</p>
    
    <p> In most eras it can feel like we haven’t invented anything useful for ten or twenty years. But that’s merely because it can take ten or twenty years for an innovation to become useful. When you realize that progress is made step-by-step, slowly over time, you realize that tiny little innovations that no one thinks much of are the seeds for what has the potential to compound into something great.
Dee Hock says, “A book is far more than what the author wrote; it is everything you can imagine and read into it as well.</p>
    
    <p>” It’s similar with new technology. The value of every new technology is not just what it can do;
it’s what someone else with a totally different skill set and point of view can eventually manipulate it into.
Another takeaway is that it’s so easy to underestimate how two small things can compound into an enormous thing. Take the way Mother Nature works: A little cool air from the north is no big deal.</p>
    
    <p> A little warm breeze from the south is pleasant. But when they mix together over Missouri you get a tornado. That’s called emergent effects, and they can be wildly powerful. Same with new technology.</p>
    
    <p> One boring thing plus one boring thing can equal one world-changing thing in a way that’s hard to fathom if you don’t respect exponential growth. The same thing happens in careers,
when someone with a few mediocre skills mixed together at the right time becomes multiple times more successful than someone who’s an expert in one thing.
On January 12, 1908—the same day the Post ran their column with Edison—the first long-distance wireless message was sent in France.
No one could foresee the inventions it eventually seeded, including helping me write this book and send it to the publisher 114 years later.</p>
    
    <p>
Same as ever.
Now, let me tell you a story about how good people are at disguising how hard their lives are.
I Harder Than It Looks and Not as Fun as It Seems “The grass is always greener on the side that’s fertilized with bullshit.” n 1963, Life magazine asked James Baldwin where he gets his inspiration.</p>
    
    <p> Baldwin responded:
You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who ever had been alive. An artist is a sort of emotional historian.
It’s a wonderful observation.</p>
    
    <p> But I think what he’s describing here is rare.
Most people do not disclose what torments them, what they’re scared of,
what they’re insecure about, or whether or not they’re actually happy.
Rarely will they give you an honest account of their flaws and failures.
The window-dressed version of ourselves is by far the most common.</p>
