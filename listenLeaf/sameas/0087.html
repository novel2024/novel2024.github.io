These are some of the most extreme examples that exist. But the idea that people who are under stress quickly embrace ideas and goals they never would otherwise has left its fingerprints all over history.
Take 94 percent tax rates after World War II. Low taxes were the most popular economic platform of the 1920s, and anyone suggesting a hike was pushed aside.</p>
    
    <p> Then everything broke with the doubleheader Depression and war. In 1943 Franklin Roosevelt effectively capped incomes at the equivalent of $400,000 per year, with everything above that taxed at 94 percent. He was reelected in a landslide the next year.
Same with the Reagan revolution.</p>
    
    <p> Almost 80 percent of Americans had high trust in the government in 1964. Then the 1970s happened. Years of high inflation and high unemployment meant Americans were ready to listen to a politician who said the government was the cause of their problems, not the solution.
The big takeaway here is that we really have no idea what policies we’ll be pushing for in, say, five or ten years.</p>
    
    <p> Unexpected hardship makes people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm.
Your personal views fall into the same trap. In investing, saying “I will be greedy when others are fearful” is easier said than done, because people underestimate how much their views and goals can change when markets break.
The reason you may embrace ideas and goals you once thought unthinkable during a downturn is because more changes during downturns than just asset prices.</p>
    
    <p>
If I, today, imagine how I’d respond to stocks falling 30 percent, I picture a world where everything is like it is today except stock valuations,
which are 30 percent cheaper.
But that’s not how the world works.
Downturns don’t happen in isolation. The reason stocks might fall 30 percent is because big groups of people, companies, and politicians screwed something up, and their screwups might sap my confidence in our ability to recover.</p>
    
    <p> So my investment priorities might shift from growth to preservation. It’s difficult to contextualize this mental shift when the economy is booming. And even though Warren Buffett says to be greedy when others are fearful, far more people agree with that quote than actually act on it.
The same idea holds true for companies, careers, and relationships.</p>
    
    <p> Hard times make people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm.
Chris Rock once joked about who actually teaches kids in school:
“Teachers do one half, bullies do the other,” he said. “And learning how to deal with bullies is the half you’ll actually use as a grown-up.” It’s real experience with risk and uncertainty, which is something you cannot fathom until you’ve experienced it firsthand.</p>
    
    <p>
Keep in mind, this works both ways. People often have no idea how they’ll respond to a big windfall or an incredible gift of good luck until they’ve experienced it firsthand.
Going to the moon is the coolest thing humans have ever done.
You’d think it would be an overwhelming experience.</p>
