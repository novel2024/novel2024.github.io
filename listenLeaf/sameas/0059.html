It changed the game, all for the worse.
The risk was that a country would “responsibly” use a tiny nuclear weapon in battle, starting a retaliatory escalation that opened the door to launching one of the big bombs.
Neither country would start a war with a big bomb. But would they launch a small one? Probably.</p>
    
    <p> And would a small bomb justify retaliating with a big one? Yes.
So the small bombs increased the odds of the big bombs being used.
Small risks weren’t the alternative to big risks; they were the trigger.
Soviet missiles in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis were four thousand times less powerful than Tsar Bomba.</p>
    
    <p> But if the Soviets had launched even one of them, according to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, there would have been a “99 percent probability” that America would have retaliated with its full nuclear force.
Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who helped create the atomic bomb,
was guilt-stricken about its destructiveness and pushed for smaller nukes to reduce the risk. He later admitted that was a mistake, because it increased the odds of a large nuclear attack.
Big risks are easy to overlook because they’re just a chain reaction of small events, each of which is easy to shrug off.</p>
    
    <p> So people always underestimate the odds of big risks.
We’ve seen it happen time after time.
No one in 1929 thought there would be a Great Depression. You’d be laughed away if you warned in 1929 that the stock market was about to fall nearly 90 percent and unemployment rise to 25 percent.</p>
    
    <p>
People weren’t complacent. The late 1920s saw an overvalued stock market, real estate speculation, and poor farm maintenance. That was obvious. It was well-documented.</p>
    
    <p> It was discussed. But so what? None of those things are a big deal in isolation.
It wasn’t until they happened at the same time, and fed off one another,
that they turned into the Great Depression.
The stock market falls, the boss loses his savings, he lays people off,
those people default on their mortgage, and the bank goes under.</p>
    
    <p> When banks fail, people lose their savings. When they lose their savings, they stop spending. When they stop spending, businesses fail. When businesses fail,
banks fail.</p>
    
    <p> When banks fail, people lose their savings—and so on endlessly.
Same thing with COVID-19.
Its initial impact was catastrophic, seemingly out of the blue.
But we didn’t get hit with a single, one-in-billions risk.</p>
