A carefree and stress-free life sounds wonderful only until you recognize the motivation and progress it prevents. No one cheers for hardship—nor should they—but we should recognize that it’s the most potent fuel of problem-solving, serving as both the root of what we enjoy today and the seed of opportunity for what we’ll enjoy tomorrow.
Next, a story of Dwight Eisenhower’s worst day, and the timeless topic of miracles and disasters.
A Overnight Tragedies and Long- Term Miracles Good news comes from compounding, which always takes time, but bad news comes from a loss in confidence or a catastrophic error that can occur in a blink of an eye.</p>

n important fact that explains a lot of things is that good news takes time but bad news tends to occur instantly.
Warren Buffett says it takes twenty years to build a reputation and five minutes to destroy one.
A lot of things work just like that.
It’s a natural part of how the world works, driven by the fact that good news comes from compounding, which always takes time, but bad news comes from a loss in confidence or a catastrophic error that can occur in the blink of an eye.</p>

— Dwight Eisenhower ate a hamburger for lunch on September 23, 1955.
Later that evening he complained of chest pain and told his wife the onions gave him heartburn. Then he began to panic. The president was having a massive heart attack.</p>
    
    <p> It could easily have killed him. If it had, Eisenhower would have joined more than seven hundred thousand Americans who died of heart disease that year.
What’s happened since has been extraordinary. But few have paid attention.</p>
    
    <p>
The age-adjusted death rate per capita from heart disease has declined more than 70 percent since the 1950s, according to the National Institutes of Health.
So many Americans die of heart disease that cutting the fatality rate by 70 percent leads to a number of lives saved that is hard to comprehend.
Had the rate not declined—if we hadn’t become better at treating heart disease and the mortality rate hadn’t plateaued since the 1950s—twenty- five million more Americans would have died from heart disease over the last sixty-five years than actually did.
Twenty-five million!
Even in a single year the improvement is incredible: more than half a million fewer Americans now die of heart disease each year than if we hadn’t made any improvements since the 1950s.</p>
    
    <p> That’s a full football stadium saved every month.
How is this not a bigger story?
Why are we not shouting in the streets about how incredible this is and building statues for cardiologists?
I’ll tell you why: because the improvement happened too slowly for anyone to notice.
The average annual decline in heart disease mortality between 1950 and 2014 was 1.5 percent per year.</p>
    
    <p>
How would you react if you saw a news headline that read, “Heart Disease Deaths Decline 1.5% Last Year.” You’d yawn and move on.
So that’s what we’ve done.</p>
    
    <p>
We do it all the time. The most important things come from compounding. But compounding takes awhile, so it’s easy to ignore.
New technologies take years or decades for people to even notice, then years or decades more for people to accept and put to use.</p>
