Antibiotics.
Interstate highways.
Helicopters.
GPS.</p>
    
    <p>
Digital photography.
Microwave ovens.
Synthetic rubber.
They all either came directly from, or were heavily influenced by, the military.</p>
    
    <p>
Why?
Are militaries home to the greatest technical visionaries? The most talented engineers?
Perhaps.
But more importantly, they’re home to Really Big Problems That Need to Be Solved Right Now.
Innovation is driven by incentives, which come in many forms.
On one hand there’s “If I don’t figure this out I might get fired.</p>
    
    <p>” That will get your brain in gear.
Then there’s “If I figure this out I might help people and make a lot of money.” That will produce creative sparks.
Then there’s what militaries have dealt with: “If we don’t figure this out right now we’re all going to die and Adolf Hitler might take over the world.</p>
    
    <p>” That will fuel the most incredible problem-solving and innovation in the shortest period of time that the world has ever seen.
Frederick Lewis Allen describes the burst of scientific progress that took place during World War II:
What the government, through its Office of Scientific Research and Development and other agencies, was constantly saying during the war was, in effect: “Is this discovery or that one of any possible war value? If so, then develop it and put it to use, and damn the expense!” Militaries are engines of innovation because they occasionally deal with problems so important—so urgent, so vital—that money and manpower are removed as obstacles, and those involved collaborate in ways that are hard to emulate during calm times.
You cannot compare the incentives of Silicon Valley coders trying to get you to click on ads to Manhattan Project physicists trying to end a war that threatened the country’s existence. You can’t even compare their capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>
The same people with the same intelligence have wildly different potential under different circumstances.
And the circumstances that tend to produce the biggest innovations are those that cause people to be worried, scared, and eager to move quickly because their future depends on it.
“Nothing can become truly resilient when everything goes right,” Shopify founder Toby Lütke said.
“The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!” wrote Nassim Taleb.</p>

Stress focuses your attention in ways good times can’t. It kills procrastination and indecision, taking what you need to get done and shoving it so close to your face that you have no choice but to pursue it,
right now and to the best of your ability.
During World War II an unnamed U.S.</p>
    
    <p> soldier was interviewed by a newspaper. Asked what he was thinking during combat, the soldier replied:
“I was hoping to remember to stay afraid because that is the best way to stay alive and not make careless mistakes.” It’s good advice and a smart insight that applies to many things.
— The 1930s were a disaster, one of the darkest periods in American history.</p>
