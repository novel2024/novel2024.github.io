    <p> But relative to that person over there, I don’t feel like I’m doing that great.” Part of that envy is useful, because saying “I want what they have” is such a powerful motivator of progress.
Yet the point stands: We might have higher incomes, more wealth, and bigger homes—but it’s all so quickly smothered by inflated expectations.
This isn’t to say the 1950s were better, or fairer, or even that we should strive to rebuild the old system—that’s a different topic.</p>
    
    <p>
But nostalgia for the 1950s is one of the best examples of what happens when expectations grow faster than circumstances.
In many ways it’s always been like that and always will be. Being driven by what other people have and you don’t is an unavoidable trait in most people.
It also highlights just how important managing expectations can be if you want to live a happy life.</p>
    
    <p>
— There are so many examples of this that defy intuition.
Actor Will Smith wrote in his biography that:
• Becoming famous is amazing.
• Being famous is a mixed bag.
• Losing fame is miserable.</p>
    
    <p>
The amount of fame almost doesn’t matter. Going from a nobody to a little famous creates a huge gap between what you expected your life to be and what it became—same on the way down, in the other direction. But being famous merely meets expectations.
Tennis player Naomi Osaka said that she got to a point in her career when winning a tournament didn’t bring her any joy—“I feel more like a relief,” she said.</p>

Harry Truman—a failed retailer, failed farmer, failed zinc miner, failed oil driller, and senator held on a leash by local Missouri businessmen—was almost universally panned when he became president after Franklin Roosevelt died. The Washington Post wrote: “We should be less than candid at this grave moment if we did not recognize the great disparity between Mr. Truman’s experience and the responsibilities that have been thrust upon him.” David McCullough wrote: “To many it was not just that the greatest of men had fallen, but that the least of men—or at any rate the least likely of men—had assumed his place.</p>
    
    <p>” Today, Truman is consistently ranked among historians’ top ten presidents of all time, often ahead of Roosevelt.
Part of the reason, I’ve come to believe, is that expectations for Truman’s abilities were so low that any leadership qualities he exhibited blew people’s minds. A little success was a win; a big success felt like a miracle.
Actual circumstances don’t make much difference in all these cases.</p>
    
    <p>
What generates the emotion is the big gap between expectations and reality.
When you think of it like that, you realize how powerful expectations are. They can make a celebrity feel miserable and a destitute family feel amazing. It’s astounding.</p>
    
    <p> Everyone, everywhere, doing almost any task, is just in pursuit of some space between expectations and reality.
But that’s so easy to overlook.
Peter Kaufman, CEO of Glenair and one of the smartest people you will ever come across, once wrote:
We tend to take every precaution to safeguard our material possessions because we know what they cost. But at the same time we neglect things which are much more precious because they don’t come with price tags attached: The real value of things like our eyesight or relationships or freedom can be hidden to us, because money is not changing hands.</p>
