Two things make that so:
• Bad news gets more attention than good news because pessimism is seductive and feels more urgent than optimism.
• The odds of a bad news story—a fraud, a corruption, a disaster— occurring in your local town at any given moment is low. When you expand your attention nationally, the odds increase. When they expand globally, the odds of something terrible happening in any given moment are 100 percent.</p>
    
    <p>
To exaggerate only a little: Local news reports on softball tournaments.
Global news reports on plane crashes and genocides.
A researcher once ranked the sentiment of news over time and found that media outlets all over the world have become steadily more gloomy over the last sixty years.
Compare this to the past.</p>
    
    <p> Here’s Frederick Lewis Allen again, writing about life in 1900:
The majority of Americans were less likely than their descendants to be dogged by that frightening sense of insecurity which comes from being jostled by forces—economic, political,
international—beyond one’s personal ken. Their horizons were close to them.
Their horizons were close to them. In modern times our horizons cover every nation, culture, political regime, and economy in the world.</p>
    
    <p>
There are so many good things that come from that.
But we shouldn’t be surprised that the world feels historically broken in recent years and will continue that way going forward. It’s not—we just see more of the bad stuff that’s always happened than we ever saw before.
The world breaks about once every ten years, on average—always has,
always will.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes it feels like terrible luck, or that bad news has new momentum. More often it’s just raw math at work. A zillion different things can go wrong, so at least one of them is likely to be causing havoc at any given moment. And given how connected we are, you’re going to hear about it.</p>
    
    <p>
— A few things to keep in mind here.
People don’t want accuracy. They want certainty.
A lot of what goes on in the prediction world is an attempt to rid yourself of the painful reality of not knowing what’s going to happen next.</p>
    
    <p> When you realize that making people feel better is more appealing than giving people useful figures, you start to see why thinking in probabilities is rare.
Charlie Munger gave a talk in the 1990s called “The Psychology of Human Misjudgment.” He listed twenty-five biases that lead to bad decisions. One is the “Doubt-Avoidance Tendency,” which he described:
The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.</p>
    
    <p>
It is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do.
Professor Philip Tetlock has spent most of his career studying experts,
self-proclaimed or otherwise. A big takeaway from his research is how awful so many experts are at predicting politics and the economy.</p>
