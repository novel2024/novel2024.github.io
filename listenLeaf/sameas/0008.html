    <p> The scream was hers.
“I’m so sorry,” I told her, bawling.
It’s hard to describe a moment like that. I didn’t know what else to say then.</p>
    
    <p> I don’t know what else to say now.
Search dogs had homed in on a spot in the avalanche field where rescuers with probe poles found Brendan and Bryan buried under six feet of snow.
They were born one day apart, and died ten feet from each other.
— Later that day I drove to see my dad at work.</p>
    
    <p> I wanted to be around my family. He met me in the parking lot and said, “I’ve never been so happy to see you.” It’s the only time in my life I’ve seen him cry.
It didn’t occur to me until that moment how close I was to going with Brendan and Bryan on that fateful run.</p>
    
    <p>
Then I began wondering: Why did I ski the backside with them once that morning, then decline a second run—a decision that almost certainly saved my life?
I’ve thought about it a million times. I have no idea.
I have no idea.
There is no explanation.</p>
    
    <p>
I didn’t think it through, I didn’t calculate the danger, I didn’t consult an expert, I didn’t weigh the pros and cons.
It was a complete fluke, a random and thoughtless bit of dumb luck that became the most important decision of my life—far more important than every intentional decision I’ve ever made—or ever will make.
That’s my personal story, and maybe you have a similar one about your own life. But if you look, I think you’ll see that a lot of history is the same.</p>
    
    <p>
Let me give you three freakish examples about how much of today’s world relies on a few tiny things you’d never think about.
— The Battle of Long Island was a disaster for George Washington’s army. His ten thousand troops were crushed by the British and its four-hundred-ship fleet.
But it could have been so much worse.</p>
    
    <p> It could have been the end of the Revolutionary War.
All the British had to do was sail up the East River and Washington’s cornered troops would have been wiped out.
But it never happened, because the wind wasn’t blowing in the right direction and sailing up the river became impossible.
Historian David McCullough once told interviewer Charlie Rose that “if the wind had been in the other direction on the night of August twenty- eighth [1776], I think it would have all been over.</p>
    
    <p>” “No United States of America if that had happened?” Rose asked.
“I don’t think so,” said McCullough.
“Just because of the wind, history was changed?” asked Rose.
“Absolutely,” said McCullough.</p>
