A common trait of human behavior is the burning desire for certainty despite living in an uncertain and probabilistic world.
Dealing with the math behind risk and uncertainty in general is difficult —something people have struggled with forever and always will. That something can be likely and not happen, or unlikely and still happen, is one of the world’s most important tricks.
— There’s a scene in the movie Zero Dark Thirty in which the CIA director questions a group of analysts who claim to have located Osama bin Laden.</p>
    
    <p>
“I’m about to go look the president in the eye,” he says. “And what I’d like to know, no bullshit, very simply, is he there, or is he not there?” The team’s leader says there’s a 60 percent to 80 percent chance Bin Laden is in the compound.
“Is that a yes or a no?” the director asks.
Most people get that certainty is rare, and the best you can do is make decisions in which the odds are in your favor.</p>
    
    <p> They understand you can be smart and end up wrong, or dumb and end up right, because that’s how luck and risk work.
But few people actually use probability in the real world, especially when judging others’ success.
Most of what people care about is, “Were you right or wrong?” “Was that a yes or a no?” Probability is about nuance and gradation. But in the real world people pay attention to black-and-white results.</p>
    
    <p>
If you said something will happen and it happens, you were right. If you said it will happen and it doesn’t, you were wrong. That’s how people think,
because it requires the least amount of effort. It’s hard to convince others— or yourself—that there could have been an alternative outcome when there’s a real-world outcome sitting in front of you.</p>
    
    <p>
The core here is that people think they want an accurate view of the future, but what they really crave is certainty.
It’s normal to want to rid yourself of the painful reality of not knowing what’s going to happen next. Someone who tells you there’s a 60 percent chance of a recession happening doesn’t do much to ease that pain. They might be adding to it.</p>
    
    <p> But someone who says “There is going to be a recession this year” offers something to grab on to with both hands,
something that feels like taking control of your future.
After the bin Laden raid, President Obama said the odds placed on whether the terrorist leader was actually in the target house were fifty-fifty.
A few years ago I heard one of the SEALs involved in the mission speak at a conference. He said that regardless of whether bin Laden was in the house, the team felt the odds they’d all be killed in the mission were also fifty-fifty.</p>
    
    <p> So here we have very high odds that the raid would have ended in disappointment or catastrophe.
It didn’t—but the alternative outcome isn’t a world many pay much attention to.
We rarely do.
Probability and uncertainty are just so difficult for us to comprehend.</p>
    
    <p>
— A related and equally important problem here is how easy it is to underestimate rare events in a world as large as ours.
Daniel Kahneman once said, “Human beings cannot comprehend very large or very small numbers. It would be useful for us to acknowledge that fact.” Evelyn Marie Adams won $3.</p>
