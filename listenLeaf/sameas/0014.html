    <p>” The wild thing is adults are just as blind to what’s going on in the world.
There’s a haunting video of a local New York City newscast from the morning of September 11, 2001, minutes before the terrorist attacks took place. It begins: “Good morning; sixty-four degrees at eight. It’s Tuesday,
September eleventh.</p>
    
    <p> .  .  . It’s going to be a beautiful day today, sunshine throughout.</p>
    
    <p> Really a splendid September day. The afternoon temperature is about eighty degrees . . .</p>
    
    <p>” Risk is what they couldn’t see coming.
— By definition there’s not much you can do about this. It’s one of those things that just is.
It’s impossible to plan for what you can’t imagine, and the more you think you’ve imagined everything the more shocked you’ll be when something happens that you hadn’t considered.</p>
    
    <p>
But two things can push you in a more helpful direction.
One, think of risk the way the State of California thinks of earthquakes.
It knows a major earthquake will happen. But it has no idea when, where, or of what magnitude.</p>
    
    <p> Emergency crews are prepared despite no specific forecast. Buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes that may not occur for a century or more. Nassim Taleb says, “Invest in preparedness,
not in prediction.” That gets to the heart of it.</p>
    
    <p>
Risk is dangerous when you think it requires a specific forecast before you start preparing for it. It’s better to have expectations that risk will arrive, though you don’t know when or where, than to rely exclusively on forecasts—almost all of which are either nonsense or about things that are well-known. Expectations and forecasts are two different things, and in a world where risk is what you don’t see, the former is more valuable than the latter.
Two, realize that if you’re only preparing for the risks you can envision,
you’ll be unprepared for the risks you can’t see every single time.</p>
    
    <p> So, in personal finance, the right amount of savings is when it feels like it’s a little too much. It should feel excessive; it should make you wince a little.
The same goes for how much debt you think you should handle— whatever you think it is, the reality is probably a little less. Your preparation shouldn’t make sense in a world where the biggest historical events all would have sounded absurd before they happened.</p>
