Van Valen argued that’s the case mainly because competition isn’t like a football game that ends with a winner who can then take a break.
Competition never stops. A species that gains an advantage over a competitor instantly incentivizes the competitor to improve. It’s an arms race.</p>
    
    <p>
Evolution is the study of advantages. Van Valen’s idea is simply that there are no permanent advantages. Everyone is madly scrambling all the time, but no one gets so far ahead that they become extinction-proof.
Some things evolve but never actually become better adapted, because threats are always changing.</p>
    
    <p> Black rhinos survived for 8 million years before being killed off by poachers. Lehman Brothers adapted and prospered for 150 years and 33 recessions before it met its match in mortgage-backed securities. Poof, gone.
No one’s ever safe.</p>
    
    <p> No one can ever rest.
Van Valen called it the Red Queen hypothesis of evolution. In Alice in Wonderland, Alice meets the Red Queen in a land where you have to run just to stay in place:
However fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything.
“I wonder if all the things move along with us?” thought poor puzzled Alice.</p>
    
    <p> And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, “Faster! Don’t try to talk! Keep running!” “Keep running” just to stay in place is how evolution works.
And isn’t this how most things in modern life work?
Business?
Products?
Careers?
Countries?
Relationships?
Yes to all of them.
Evolution is ruthless and unforgiving—it doesn’t teach by showing you what works but by destroying what doesn’t.
One takeaway is that you should never be surprised when something that dominates one era dies off in the next.</p>
    
    <p> It’s one of the most common stories in history. Few companies, products, musicians, cities, or authors remain relevant for more than a few decades, tops. The ones that have (the Beatles,
Levi’s, Snickers, New York City) are rare exceptions.
Another takeaway is to keep running.</p>
    
    <p> No competitive advantage is so powerful that it can let you rest on your laurels—and in fact the ones that appear to do so tend to seed their own demise.
Now let me share why it’s so hard to gauge how good our future might be.
T The Wonders of the Future It always feels like we’re falling behind, and it’s easy to discount the potential of new technology.
here’s a typical path of how people respond to what eventually becomes a world-changing new technology:
• I’ve never heard of it.</p>
    
    <p>
• I’ve heard of it but don’t understand it.
• I understand it, but I don’t see how it’s useful.
• I see how it could be fun for rich people, but not me.
• I use it, but it’s just a toy.</p>
