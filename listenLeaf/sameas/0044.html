    <p> It was called a superbloom, and it caused even desert towns to be covered in green.
A dry 2018 meant all that vegetation died and became dry kindling. That led to some of the biggest wildfires California had ever seen.
So record rain directly led to record fires.</p>
    
    <p>
There’s a long history of this, verified by looking at tree rings, which inscribe both heavy rainfall and subsequent fire scars. The two go hand in hand. “A wet year reduces fires while increasing vegetation growth, but then the increased vegetation dries out in subsequent dry years, thereby increasing the fire fuel,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote.
That’s hardly intuitive, but here again—calm plants the seeds of crazy.</p>
    
    <p>
What calm planting the seeds of crazy does is important: It makes us fundamentally underestimate the odds of things going wrong, and the consequences of something going wrong. Things can become the most dangerous when people perceive them to be the safest.
After slapping Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars, Will Smith turned to Denzel Washington for advice. Washington said, “At your highest moment,
be careful.</p>
    
    <p> That’s when the devil comes for you.” — A final word about why things have a tendency of getting out of hand. It’s that optimism and pessimism always have to overshoot what seems reasonable, because the only way to discover the limits of what’s possible is to venture a little way past those limits.
Jerry Seinfeld had the most popular show on TV.</p>
    
    <p> Then he quit.
He later said the reason he killed his show while it was thriving was because the only way to know where the top is, is to experience the decline,
which he had no interest in doing. Maybe the show could keep rising,
maybe it couldn’t. He was fine not knowing the answer.</p>
    
    <p>
If you want to know why there’s a long history of economies and markets blowing past the boundaries of sanity, bouncing from boom to bust,
bubble to crash, it’s because so few people have Seinfeld’s mentality. We insist on knowing where the top is, and the only way to find it is to keep pushing until we’ve gone too far, when we can look back and say, “Ah, I guess that was the top.” Are stocks overvalued? What is bitcoin worth? How high can Tesla go?
You can’t answer those questions with a formula. They’re driven by whatever someone else is willing to pay for them in any given moment— how they feel, what they want to believe, and how persuasive the storytellers are.</p>
    
    <p> And the stories change all the time. They can’t be predicted any more than you can predict what kind of mood you’ll be in three years from now.
If an investment might have potential to go higher, somebody somewhere will test it to find out. People’s desire to get rich far exceeds the number of easy and obvious opportunities.</p>
    
    <p> So if you put up a sign that says “There might be an opportunity in this box,” somebody will always open the box. Which is to say: we have to identify where the top is.
That’s why markets don’t stay within the limits of sanity, and why they always overdose on pessimism and optimism.
They have to.</p>
