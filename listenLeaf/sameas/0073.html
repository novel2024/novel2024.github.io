    <p> It works well for a while and then backfires spectacularly at the point where the benefits are nice but the losses are lethal.
Take injury. Big animals are fragile. An ant can fall from an elevation fifteen thousand times its height and walk away unharmed.</p>
    
    <p> A rat will break bones falling from an elevation fifty times its height. A human will die from a fall at ten times its height. An elephant falling from twice its height splashes like a water balloon.
Big animals also require lots of land per capita, which is brutal when land becomes scarce.</p>
    
    <p> They need more food per unit of body mass than small animals, which is the end game in a famine. They can’t hide easily.
They move slow. They reproduce slowly.</p>
    
    <p> Their top-of-the-food-chain status means they usually don’t need to adapt, which is an unfortunate trait when adapting is required. The most dominant creatures tend to be huge, but the most enduring tend to be smaller. T-Rex < cockroach < bacteria.
What’s incredible about this is that evolution encourages you to get bigger, then punishes you for being big.</p>

It’s a telling sign of what happens in so many areas of life: Competitive advantages don’t stick around for long.
Let me show you how this played out in one of America’s most storied companies: Sears.
— The only thing harder than gaining a competitive edge is not losing an advantage when you have one.
If you were a movie scriptwriter and had to dream up a fake company with the strongest competitive advantage you can imagine, you would probably come up with something that looks like what Sears was in the 1970s.</p>
    
    <p>
Sears was the largest retailer in the world, housed in the tallest building in the world, employing one of the largest workforces.
“No one has to tell you you’ve come to the right place. The look of merchandising authority is complete and unmistakable,” The New York Times wrote of Sears in 1983.
Sears was so good at retailing that in the 1970s and ’80s it ventured into other areas, like finance.</p>
    
    <p> It owned Allstate Insurance, Discover credit card company, the Dean Witter brokerage for your stocks, and the Coldwell Banker brokerage for your house.
Sears was, in almost every way, the Amazon of its day: so dominant at retailing efficiency that it could spread its magic into unrelated industries,
where it would terrify rivals. The Times wrote in 1974:
Donald T. Regan, chairman of Merrill Lynch  .</p>
    
    <p>  .  . indicated yesterday that the firm sees itself eventually as a Sears, Roebuck of the investment business.  .</p>
