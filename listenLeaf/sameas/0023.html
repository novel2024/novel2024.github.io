Patton laughs hysterically, raises his glass, and says, “Now that’s something I can drink to. From one son of a bitch to another!” That may perfectly sum up how extremely successful people operate. Of course they have abnormal characteristics. That’s why they’re successful!
And there is no world in which we should assume that all those abnormal characteristics are positive, polite, endearing, or appealing.</p>
    
    <p>
Something I’ve long thought true, and which shows up constantly when you look for it, is that people who are abnormally good at one thing tend to be abnormally bad at something else. It’s as if the brain has capacity for only so much knowledge and emotion, and an abnormal skill robs bandwidth from other parts of someone’s personality.
Take Elon Musk.
What kind of thirty-two-year-old thinks they can take on GM, Ford, and NASA at the same time? An utter maniac.</p>
    
    <p> The kind of person who thinks normal constraints don’t apply to them—not in an egotistical way, but in a genuine, believe-it-in-your-bones way. Which is also the kind of person who doesn’t worry about, say, Twitter etiquette.
A mindset that can dump a personal fortune into colonizing Mars is not the kind of mindset that worries about the downsides of hyperbole. And the kind of person who proposes making Mars habitable by constantly dropping nuclear bombs in its atmosphere is not the kind of person worried about overstepping the boundaries of reality.</p>
    
    <p>
The kind of person who says there’s a 99.9999 percent chance humanity is a computer simulation is not the kind of person worried about making untenable promises to shareholders.
The kind of person who promises to solve the water problems in Flint,
Michigan, within days of trying to save a Thai children’s soccer team stuck in a cave, within days of rebuilding the Tesla Model 3 assembly line in a tent, is not the kind of person who views his lawyers signing off as a critical step.
People love the visionary genius side of Musk, but want it to come without the side that operates in his distorted I-don’t-care-about-your- customs version of reality.</p>
    
    <p> But I don’t think those two things can be separated. They’re the risk-reward trade-offs of the same personality trait.
Same for John Boyd.
Same for Steve Jobs, who was both a genius and could be a monster of a boss.</p>
    
    <p>
Same for Walt Disney, whose ambitions pushed every company he touched to the razor’s edge of bankruptcy.
Former U.S. national security advisor McGeorge Bundy once told President John F.</p>
    
    <p> Kennedy that trying to go to the moon was a crazy goal.
Kennedy responded: “You don’t run for president in your forties unless you have a certain moxie.” — Part of this idea is realizing that people who are capable of achieving incredible things often take risks that can backfire just as powerfully.
What kind of person makes their way to the top of a successful company,
or a big country?
Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn’t take no for an answer,
and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities.</p>
    
    <p>
What kind of person is likely to go overboard, bite off more than they can chew, and discount risks that are blindingly obvious to others?
Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn’t take no for an answer,
and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities.
Reversion to the mean is one of the most common stories in history. It’s the main character in economies, markets, countries, companies, careers— everything. Part of the reason it happens is because the same personality traits that push people to the top also increase the odds of pushing them over the edge.</p>
