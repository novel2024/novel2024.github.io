    <p> By birth, a baby has 100 billion neurons, 250 trillion synapses, 11 cooperating organ systems, and a personality. It’s staggeringly complex.
Death, on the other hand, is simple. Most deaths—trauma, heart disease,
stroke, some cancers, infections, drug overdoses—are caused by blood and oxygen deficiencies.</p>
    
    <p> That’s it. A disease itself might be complex, but the fatal strike is not enough blood and oxygen getting to where it’s needed.
Making a human: incomprehensibly complex.
The death of a human: really simple.</p>
    
    <p>
On a similar note, author Yuval Noah Harari writes: “To enjoy peace, we need almost everyone to make good choices. By contrast, a poor choice by just one side can lead to war.” The idea of “complex to make, simple to break” is everywhere.
Construction requires skilled engineers; demolition requires only a sledgehammer.</p>
    
    <p> Even when something doesn’t break easily, the thing that could break it is usually simpler than whatever made it.
The irony is that growth and progress are way more powerful than setbacks. But setbacks will always get more attention because of how fast they occur. So slow progress amid a drumbeat of bad news is the normal state of affairs.</p>
    
    <p> It’s not an easy thing to get used to, but it’ll always be with us.
A couple things stick out here.
A lot of progress and good news concerns things that didn’t happen,
whereas virtually all bad news is about what did occur.
Good news is the deaths that didn’t take place, the diseases you didn’t get,
the wars that never happened, the tragedies avoided, and the injustices prevented.</p>
    
    <p> That’s hard for people to contextualize or even imagine, let alone measure.
But bad news is visible. More than visible, it’s in your face. It’s the terrorist attack, the war, the car accident, the pandemic, the stock market crash, and the political battle you can’t look away from.</p>
    
    <p>
It is so easy to discount how much progress is achievable.
If I were to say, “What are the odds the average American will be twice as rich fifty years from now?” it sounds preposterous. The odds seem very low. Twice as rich as they are today? Doubling what we already have? It seems too ambitious.</p>
    
    <p>
But then if I said, “What are the odds we can achieve 1.4 percent average annual growth for the next fifty years?” I almost sound like a pessimist. One percent? That’s it?
But those numbers, of course, are the same.
It’s always been like that, and always will be.</p>
