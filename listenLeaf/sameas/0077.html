• It’s becoming more useful for me.

• I could not imagine life without it.
• Seriously, people lived without it?
• It’s too powerful and needs to be regulated.</p>

It happens over and over again. It’s very difficult to envision what one small invention has the potential to become one day.
— A common view through history is that past innovation was magnificent,
but future innovation must be limited because we’ve picked all the low- hanging fruit.
On January 12, 1908, The Washington Post ran a full-page spread headlined “America’s Thinking Men Forecast the Wonders of the Future.</p>
    
    <p>” Among the “thinking men” buried in the fine print was Thomas Edison.
Edison had already changed the world at this point; he was the Steve Jobs of his time.
The Post editors asked: “Is the age of invention passing?” Edison answered: “Passing?” he repeated, in apparent astonishment that such a question should be asked. “Why, it hasn’t started yet.</p>
    
    <p> That ought to answer your question. Do you want anything else?” “You believe, then, that the next 50 years will see as great a mechanical and scientific development as the past half century?” the Post queried Edison.
“Greater. Much greater,” he replied.</p>
    
    <p>
“Along what lines do you expect this development?” they asked him.
“Along all lines.” This wasn’t blind optimism. Edison understood the process of scientific discovery.</p>
    
    <p> Big innovations don’t come at once, but rather are built up slowly when several small innovations are combined over time. Edison wasn’t a grand planner. He was a prolific tinkerer, combining parts in ways he didn’t quite understand, confident that little discoveries along the way would be combined and leveraged into more meaningful inventions.
Edison, for example, did not invent the first light bulb; he just greatly improved upon what others had already built.</p>
    
    <p> In 1802—three quarters of a century before Edison’s lightbulb—a British inventor named Humphry Davy created an electric light called an arc lamp, using charcoal rods as a filament. It worked like Edison’s lightbulb, but it was impractically bright —you’d nearly go blind looking at it—and could stay lit only for a few moments before burning out, so it was rarely used. Edison’s contribution was moderating the bulb’s brightness and longevity. That was an enormous breakthrough.</p>
    
    <p> But it was built on the back of dozens of previous breakthroughs, none of which seemed meaningful in their own right.
That was why Edison was so optimistic about innovation.
He explained:
You can never tell what apparently small discovery will lead to. Somebody discovers something and immediately a host of experimenters and inventors are playing all the variations upon it.</p>
