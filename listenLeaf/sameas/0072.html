I demand excellence, they say. But it’s just unrealistic. The huge majority of them won’t thrive in their careers. Compounding is fueled by endurance, so sitting through periods of insanity is not a defect; it’s accepting an optimal level of hassle.</p>
    
    <p>
Same in business. My friend Brent says running a company is like eating glass while being punched in the face. “Often nothing works. Emotions run wild.</p>
    
    <p> Confusion reigns.” He’s also equated it to a daily battle—you wake up every morning, grab your knife, fight off challenges, and pray you make it home alive. But dealing with that hassle is the entire reason why it can be lucrative. “Where there’s pain there’s profit,” he often reminds people.</p>
    
    <p>
There’s an optimal level of hassle to accept, even embrace.
Another upside: Once you accept a certain level of inefficiency, you stop denying its existence and have a clearer view of how the world works.
I was once on a flight with a CEO—he let everyone know that’s what he was—who lost his mind after we had to change gates twice. I wondered:
How did he make it this far in life without the ability to deal with petty annoyances outside of his control? The most likely answer is that he lives in denial over what he thinks he’s in control of and demands unrealistic precision from subordinates who compensate by hiding bad news.</p>
    
    <p>
A good rule of thumb for a lot of things is to identify the price and be willing to pay it. The price, for so many things, is putting up with an optimal amount of hassle.
Next, a painful truth: The only thing harder than gaining a competitive advantage is keeping one.
E Keep Running Most competitive advantages eventually die.</p>

volution is good at what it does. And one of the things it does is give animals bigger bodies over time.
Edward Drinker Cope was a nineteenth-century paleontologist. His work, later deemed Cope’s Rule—not universal enough to call a law— tracked the lineages of thousands of species and showed a clear bias toward animals evolving to become larger over time.</p>

Horses went from the size of small dogs to their modern height. Snakes from no longer than an inch to modern boas. Dinosaurs from three-inch lizards to a brontosaurus. And humans, from ancestors who millions of years ago averaged less than four feet in height as adults to our modern stature.</p>
    
    <p>
This isn’t surprising. Bigger species are better at capturing prey, can travel longer distances, and can support bigger brains.
The obvious question is: Why hasn’t evolution made every species enormous?
Two scientists, Aaron Clauset of the Santa Fe Institute and Douglas Erwin of the Museum of Natural History, explained why in a paper that summed it up in a wonderful sentence: “The tendency for evolution to create larger species is counterbalanced by the tendency of extinction to kill off larger species.” Body size in biology is like leverage in investing: It accentuates the gains but amplifies the losses.</p>
