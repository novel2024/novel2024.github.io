“We banded ourselves together,” Perkins wrote, “moved by a sense of stricken guilt, to prevent this kind of disaster from ever happening again.” She called it “a never-to-be-forgotten reminder of why I had to spend my life fighting conditions that could permit such a tragedy.” The Triangle fire tragedy was in many ways the beginning of a workers’ rights movement that transformed the twentieth century.
Looking back almost half a century after the fire, Perkins said that the New Deal—the 1930s economic policies to remake the U.</p>
    
    <p>S. economy with an eye toward workers’ rights—began in spirit on March 25, 1911, the day of the Triangle fire.
Stress, pain, discomfort, shock, and disgust—for all its tragic downsides,
it’s also when the magic happens.
— Cars and airplanes are two of the biggest innovations of modern times.</p>

But there’s an interesting thing about their early years.
Few looked at early cars and said, “Oh, there’s a thing I can commute to work in.” Few saw a plane and said, “Aha, I can use that to get to my next vacation.” It took decades for people to see that potential.</p>

What they did say early on was, “Can we mount a machine gun on that?
Can we drop bombs out of it?” Adolphus Greely was one of the first people outside the car industry to realize the “horseless carriage” could be useful. Greely, a brigadier general,
purchased three cars in 1899—almost a decade before Ford’s Model T—for the U.S. Army to experiment with.</p>

In one of its first mentions of automobiles, the Los Angeles Times wrote about General Greely’s purchase:
It can be used for the transportation of light artillery such as machine guns. It can be utilized for the carrying of equipment,
ammunition and supplies; for taking the wounded to the rear,
and, in general, for most of the purposes to which the power of mules and horses is now applied.
Nine years later, the Los Angeles Times did an interview with young brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, who talked about the prospects of their new flying machine:
The utility of the airship, they think, will lie entirely in its advantage as a reconnoitering agent in time of war. They have no desire to sell their invention to a private company but desire to have the War Department at Washington take it up.</p>
    
    <p>
The Wrights had reason to believe this was true. Their only real customer in their early years—the only group to show interest in airplanes —was the U.S. Army, which purchased the first “flyer” in 1908.</p>
    
    <p>
The army’s early interest in cars and planes wasn’t a fluke of lucky foresight. Go down the list of big innovations, and militaries show up repeatedly.
Radar.
Atomic energy.</p>
    
    <p>
The internet.
Microprocessors.
Jets.
Rockets.</p>
