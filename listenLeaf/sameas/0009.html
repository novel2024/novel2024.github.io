— Compelled to save money, Captain William Turner shut down the fourth boiler room on his giant steamship for its passage from New York to Liverpool. The decision would slow the ship’s voyage by one day—an annoyance, but worth the savings as the passenger-ship industry struggled economically.
Little did he or anyone else know how fateful the decision would be.
The delay meant Turner’s ship—the Lusitania—would now sail directly into the path of a German submarine.</p>
    
    <p>
The Lusitania was hit with a torpedo, killing nearly twelve hundred passengers and becoming the most important trigger to rally U.S. public support for entering World War I.
Had the fourth boiler room been operating, Turner would have reached Liverpool a day before the German submarine had even entered the Celtic Sea, where it crossed paths with the Lusitania.</p>
    
    <p> The ship likely would have avoided attack. A country may have avoided a war that became the seed event for the rest of the twentieth century.
— Giuseppe Zangara was tiny, barely five feet tall. He stood on a chair outside a Miami political rally in 1933 because that was the only way he could aim his gun across the crowd.</p>
    
    <p>
Zangara fired five shots. One of them hit Chicago mayor Anton Cermak,
who was shaking hands with Zangara’s intended target. Cermak died. The target, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was sworn in as president two weeks later.</p>
    
    <p>
Within months of his inauguration Roosevelt transformed the U.S.
economy through the New Deal. John Nance Garner—who would have become president had Zangara hit his target—opposed most of the New Deal’s deficit spending.</p>
    
    <p> He almost certainly wouldn’t have enacted many of the same policies, some of which still shape today’s economy.
— You can play this game all day. Every big story could have turned out differently if a few little puffs of nothingness went the other direction.
So much of the world hangs by a thread.</p>
    
    <p>
An irony of studying history is that we often know exactly how a story ends, but we have no idea where it began.
Here’s an example: What caused the 2008 financial crisis?
Well, you have to understand the mortgage market.
What shaped the mortgage market? Well, you have to understand the thirty-year decline in interest rates that preceded it.
What caused falling interest rates? Well, you have to understand the inflation of the 1970s.</p>
    
    <p>
What caused that inflation? Well, you have to understand the monetary system of the 1970s and the hangover effects from the Vietnam War.
What caused the Vietnam War? Well, you have to understand the West’s fear of communism after World War II . . .</p>
