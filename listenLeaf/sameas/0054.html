    <p> Flying is as safe as it is because after every accident comes an intense learn-and-fix process that reduces the odds of similar future accidents.
The same thing occurred in the 2000s, when an oil shock in 2008 that made prices surge incentivized oil companies to innovate on drilling techniques, which brought American oil production to record highs. Would the innovation boom have occurred without the previous crisis? Almost certainly not.
Same during COVID-19, when a generational risk and panic set off an astounding development and production of new vaccines.</p>
    
    <p>
Vannevar Bush, who ran the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II, controversially suggested the medical advances that came about from the war—most notably the production and use of antibiotics—may have saved more lives than were lost during the war.
It’s so difficult to imagine these upsides as a crisis is happening.</p>
    
    <p> But time and again throughout history, the upsides indeed occur.
— There’s an obvious limit to stress-induced innovation.
There’s a delicate balance between helpful stress and crippling disaster.
The latter prevents innovation as resources are sapped and people turn their attention from getting out of a crisis to merely surviving it.</p>
    
    <p>
And perhaps just as important is what happens when we have the opposite. When everything is great—when wealth is flush, when the outlook is bright, when responsibility is low, and threats appear gone—you get some of the worst, dumbest, least-productive human behavior.
President Richard Nixon once observed:
The unhappiest people of the world are those in the international watering places like the South Coast of France, and Newport, and Palm Springs, and Palm Beach. Going to parties every night.</p>
    
    <p> Playing golf every afternoon. Drinking too much.
Talking too much. Thinking too little.</p>
    
    <p> Retired. No purpose.
So while there are those that would totally disagree with this and say “Gee, if I could just be a millionaire! That would be the most wonderful thing.” If I could just not have to work every day, if I could just be out fishing or hunting or playing golf or traveling, that would be the most wonderful life in the world— they don’t know life.</p>
    
    <p> Because what makes life mean something is purpose. A goal. The battle, the struggle—even if you don’t win it.
Entrepreneur Andrew Wilkinson echoed the same when he said, “Most successful people are just a walking anxiety disorder harnessed for productivity.</p>
    
    <p>” Investor Patrick O’Shaughnessy writes: “In my experience many of the most talented people I’ve met couldn’t be described as happy. In fact there are probably more that could be described as ‘tortured.’  ” The fear, the pain, the struggle are motivators that positive feelings can never match.
That’s a big takeaway from history, and it leads to a realization that will always be true: Be careful what you wish for.</p>
