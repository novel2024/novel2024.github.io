When good and honest people can be incentivized into crazy behavior,
it’s easy to underestimate the odds of the world going off the rails.
Everything from wars to recessions to frauds to business failures to market bubbles happen more often than people think because the moral boundaries of what people are willing to do can be extended with certain incentives.
That goes both ways. It’s easy to underestimate how much good people can do, how talented they can become, and what they can accomplish when they operate in a world where their incentives are aligned toward progress.</p>
    
    <p>
Extremes are the norm.
Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate.
Incentives can keep crazy, unsustainable trends going longer than seems reasonable because there are social and financial reasons preventing people from accepting reality for as long as they can.
A good question to ask is, “Which of my current views would change if my incentives were different?” If you answer “none,” you are likely not only persuaded but blinded by your incentives.</p>
    
    <p>
— Speaking of persuasion, let’s discuss a related point: Nothing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand.
N Now You Get It Nothing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand.
othing is more persuasive than what you’ve experienced firsthand.
You can read and study and have empathy.</p>
    
    <p> But you often have no clue what you’re willing to do, what you want, and how far you’re willing to go until you’ve seen something with your own eyes.
Harry Truman once said:
The next generation never learns anything from the previous one until it’s brought home with a hammer. . .</p>
    
    <p> . I’ve wondered why the next generation can’t profit from the generation before,
but they never do until they get knocked in the head by experience.
A big theme throughout history is that preferences are fickle, and people have no idea how they’ll respond to an extreme shift in circumstance until they experience it for themselves.
— One of the most fascinating parts of the Great Depression isn’t just that the economy collapsed, but how quickly and dramatically people’s views changed as a result.</p>
    
    <p>
Americans voted Herbert Hoover into office in 1928 with one of the biggest landslides in history (444 electoral college votes). They voted him out in 1932 with a landslide in the other direction (59 electoral college votes).
Then the big changes began.
The gold standard, gone.</p>
    
    <p> Gold actually became illegal to own.
Public works surged.
Attempts to provide taxpayer-funded old-age pension insurance made no progress for decades, with supporters arrested on the Capitol lawn during the most serious push, after World War I. The Depression practically flipped a switch: a fringe idea was suddenly embraced.</p>
    
    <p> The Social Security Act was passed in 1935, 372–33 in the House of Representatives and 77–6 in the Senate.
On the other side of this was an alleged coup by wealthy businessmen to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt, with a Marine general named Smedley Butler taking his place as dictator, similar to fascist actions sweeping Europe at the time.
These are not the kind of things that occur when people have full stomachs and stable jobs. It’s not until your life is upended, your hopes dashed, your dreams uncertain that people say, “What was that wild idea we heard before? Maybe we should give it a shot.</p>
