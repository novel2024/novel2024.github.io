Same thing after World War II.
The postwar years saw an economic boom in the United States. Europe,
physically destroyed, was a different story. In 1947 Hamilton Fish Armstrong reported in Foreign Affairs magazine about life in Europe:
Every minute is dedicated to scrounging enough food,
clothing and fuel to carry through the next 24 hours.</p>
    
    <p> There is too little of everything . . . too few houses to live in and not enough glass to supply them with window panes; too little leather for shoes, wool for sweaters, gas for cooking, cotton for diapers,
sugar for jam, fats for frying, milk for babies, soap for washing.</p>

After the war, John Maynard Keynes predicted countries wrecked by war would go on to have a “craving for social and personal security.” Which is what happened.
Historian Tony Judt notes that the state of affairs was so bad in postwar Europe that only the state could offer hope of salvation to the masses of displaced people. So it did.</p>
    
    <p> Everything from generous unemployment insurance to universal health care became common after the war in ways that never caught on in America.
Historian Michael Howard has said that war and welfare go hand in hand. Perhaps that’s because even the most financially prepared, the most risk averse, and those with the most foresight can be completely crushed by war. Europeans did not get to choose whether they wanted to be caught up in World War II—it became the most pressing issue of their lives whether they supported it or not, and it crushed their sense of control whether they prepared for it or not.</p>

It’s why baby boomers who lived through the 1970s and ’80s think about inflation in ways their children couldn’t fathom as young adults.
And it’s why you can separate today’s tech entrepreneurs into two clearly different buckets—those who experienced the dot-com crash in the late 1990s, and those who didn’t because they were too young.
Two things tend to happen after you get hit with something big and unexpected:
• You assume what just happened will keep happening, but with greater force and consequence.
• You forecast with great conviction, despite the original event being improbable and something few, if anyone, predicted.</p>
    
    <p>
The more impactful the surprise, the more this is true.
And, importantly, the more those who didn’t experience that big event will struggle to understand your point of view.
The oldest story is that of two sides who don’t agree with each other.
The question “Why don’t you agree with me?” can have infinite answers.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed.
But usually a better question is, “What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?” It’s the question that contains the most answers about why people don’t agree with one another.
But it’s such a hard question to ask.
It’s uncomfortable to think that what you haven’t experienced might change what you believe, because it’s admitting your own ignorance.</p>
    
    <p> It’s much easier to assume that those who disagree with you aren’t thinking as hard as you are.
So people will disagree, even as access to information explodes. They may disagree more than ever because, as Benedict Evans says, “The more the Internet exposes people to new points of view, the angrier people get that different views exist.” Disagreement has less to do with what people know and more to do with what they’ve experienced.</p>
