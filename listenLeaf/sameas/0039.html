GameStop was the opposite. It looked like it was on the edge of going out of business in 2020. Then it became a cultural obsession on Reddit, the stock surged, the company raised a ton of money, and at one point in 2021 it was worth $11 billion.
Same thing here: The most important variable was the stories people told themselves.</p>
    
    <p> And that was the only thing you couldn’t measure and couldn’t predict with foresight. That’s why the results don’t compute.
Whenever something like this happens you see people shocked and angry about how the world has become detached from fundamentals.
But Grant was right: It’s always been like this.</p>
    
    <p>
The 1920s were giddy. The ’30s were pure panic. The world was coming to an end in the ’40s. The ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s were boom to bust, over and over.</p>
    
    <p> The ’80s and ’90s were insane. The 2000s have been like a reality TV show.
If you’ve relied on data and logic alone to make sense of the economy,
you’d have been confused for a hundred years straight.
Economist Per Bylund once noted: “The concept of economic value is easy: whatever someone wants has value, regardless of the reason (if any).</p>
    
    <p>” Not utility, not profits—just whether people want it or not, for any reason. So much of what happens in the economy is rooted in emotions,
which can, at times, be nearly impossible to make sense of.
To me it’s obvious that the one thing you can’t measure, can’t predict,
and can’t model in a spreadsheet is the most powerful force in all of business and investing—just like it’s the most powerful force in the military. Same in politics.</p>
    
    <p> Same in careers. Same in relationships. A lot of things don’t compute.
The danger, one you see often in investing, is when people become too McNamara-like—so obsessed with data and so confident in their models that they leave no room for error or surprise.</p>
    
    <p> No room for things to be crazy, dumb, unexplainable, and to remain that way for a long time. Always asking “Why is this happening?” and expecting there to be a rational answer. Or worse, always mistaking what happened for what you think should have happened.
The ones who thrive long term are those who understand the real world is a never-ending chain of absurdity, confusion, messy relationships, and imperfect people.</p>
    
    <p>
Making sense of that world requires admitting a few things.
— John Nash is one of the smartest mathematicians to ever live; he won the Nobel Prize. He was also schizophrenic and spent most of his life convinced that aliens were sending him coded messages.
In her book A Beautiful Mind, Sylvia Nasar recounts a conversation between Nash and Harvard professor George Mackey:
“How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof .</p>
