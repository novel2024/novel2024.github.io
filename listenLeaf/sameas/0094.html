    <p> Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking could teach math with simple language that didn’t hurt your head, not because they dumbed down the topics but because they knew how to get from A to Z in as few steps as possible. An effective rule of thumb doesn’t bypass complexity; it wraps things you don’t understand into things you do. Like a baseball player who—by keeping a ball level in his gaze—knows where the ball will land as well as a physicist calculating the ball’s flight with precision.
The problem with simplicity is that the reps don’t hurt, so you don’t feel like you’re getting a mental workout.</p>
    
    <p> It can create a preference for laborious learning that students are actually okay with because it feels like a cognitive bench press, with all the assumed benefits.
— Thomas McCrae was a young nineteenth-century doctor still unsure of his skills. One day he diagnosed a patient with a common, insignificant stomach ailment. McCrae’s medical school professor watched the diagnosis and interrupted with every student’s nightmare: in fact, the patient had a rare and serious disease.</p>
    
    <p> McCrae had never heard of it.
The diagnosis required immediate surgery. After opening the patient up,
the professor realized that McCrae’s initial diagnosis was correct. The patient was fine.</p>
    
    <p>
McCrae later wrote that he actually felt fortunate for never having heard of the rare disease.
It allowed his mind to settle on the most likely diagnosis, rather than be burdened by searching for rare diseases, like his more educated professor.
He wrote: “The moral of this is not that ignorance is an advantage. But some of us are too much attracted by the thought of rare things and forget the law of averages in diagnosis.</p>
    
    <p>” That idea is not intuitive, so it can drive you crazy. And it’s hard to pinpoint when it occurs—maybe McCrae’s professor was being appropriately cautious?
But a truth that applies to almost every field is that there are no points awarded for difficulty. It’s possible to try too hard, to be too attracted to complexity, and doing so can backfire spectacularly.
We’ve made it to the last chapter.</p>
    
    <p> It’s one of my favorites.
D Wounds Heal, Scars Last What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?
rive past the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C., and there is no trace of the plane that crashed into its walls on September 11, 2001.</p>
    
    <p>
But drive three minutes down the road, to Reagan National Airport, and the scars of 9/11 are everywhere. Shoes off, jackets off, belts off, toothpaste out, hands up, and empty your water bottle while going through security.
Here’s a common theme in the way people think: Wounds heal, but scars last.
There’s a long history of people adapting and rebuilding while the scars of their ordeal remain forever, changing how they think about risk, reward,
opportunities, and goals for as long as they live.</p>
    
    <p>
An important component of human behavior is that people who’ve had different experiences than you will think differently than you do. They’ll have different goals, outlooks, wishes, and values. So most debates are not actual disagreements; they’re people with different experiences talking over each other.
Let me share a few times in history when the weight of personal experiences led to massive shifts in people’s outlook on life.</p>
