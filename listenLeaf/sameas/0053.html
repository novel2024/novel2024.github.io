    <p> It is a definite necessity. . . .</p>
    
    <p>
In our homes it serves not only for light, but it can become the willing servant of the family in countless ways. It can relieve the drudgery of the housewife and lift the great burden off the shoulders of the hardworking farmer.
Electricity becoming a “willing servant”—introducing washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators—freed up hours of household labor in a way that let female workforce participation rise. It’s a trend that lasted more than half a century and is a key driver of both twentieth-century growth and gender equality.</p>

Another productivity surge of the 1930s came from everyday people forced by necessity to find more bang for their buck.
The first supermarket opened in 1930. The traditional way of purchasing food was to walk from your butcher, who served you from behind a counter,
to the bakery, who served you from behind a counter, to a produce stand,
who took your order. Combining everything under one roof and making customers pick it from the shelves themselves was a way to make the economics of selling food work during a time when a quarter of the nation was unemployed.</p>
    
    <p>
Laundromats were also invented in the 1930s after sales of individual washing machines fell; they marketed themselves as washing machine rentals.
Factories of all kinds looked at bludgeoned sales and said, “What must we do to survive?” The answer often was to build the kind of assembly line Henry Ford introduced to the world in the previous decade.
Output per hour in factories had grown 21 percent during the 1920s.
“During the Depression decade of 1930–1940—when many plants were shut down or working part time,” Frederick Lewis Allen wrote, “there was intense pressure for efficiency and economy—it had increased by an amazing 41 per cent.</p>
    
    <p>” “The trauma of the Great Depression did not slow down the American invention machine,” economist Robert Gordon wrote. “If anything, the pace of innovation picked up.” Driving knowledge work in the ’30s was the fact that more young people stayed in school because they had nothing else to do. High school graduation surged during the Depression to levels not seen again until the 1960s.</p>
    
    <p>
All of this—the better factories, the new ideas, the educated workers— became vital in 1941 when America entered the war and became the Allied manufacturing engine.
The big question is whether the technical leap of the 1930s could have happened without the devastation of the Depression.
And I think the answer is no—at least not to the extent that it occurred.
You could never push through something like the New Deal without an economy so wrecked that people were desperate to try anything to fix it.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s doubtful that business owners and entrepreneurs would so urgently have found new efficiencies without the record threat of business failure.
Managers looking at their employees and saying, “Go try something new. Blow up the playbook, I don’t care,” is not something that gets said when the economy is booming and the outlook is bright.
Big, fast changes happen only when they’re forced by necessity.</p>
    
    <p>
World War II began on horseback in 1939 and ended with nuclear fission in 1945. NASA was created in 1958, two weeks after the Soviets launched Sputnik, and landed on the moon just eleven years later. Stuff like that rarely happens that fast without fear as a motivator.
Same with commercial airplanes.</p>
