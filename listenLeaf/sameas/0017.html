The homeownership rate was 12 percentage points lower in 1950 than it is today.
An average home was a third smaller than today’s, despite having more occupants.
Food consumed 29 percent of an average household’s budget in 1950 versus 13 percent today.
Workplace deaths were three times higher than today.</p>
    
    <p>
That’s the economic era we long for?
Yes. And it’s important to understand why.
— Ben Ferencz had a hard childhood. His immigrant father didn’t speak English, was unemployable, and settled in an area of New York controlled by the Italian mob, where violence was a part of everyday life.</p>
    
    <p>
But Ferencz said none of it seemed to bother his parents. They were thrilled. He recalled:
It was a tough life but they didn’t know it because where they’d come from it was tougher. So it was an improvement no matter what.</p>
    
    <p>
The Ferenczes fled Romania to escape Jewish persecution during the Holocaust. The family came to America on the open deck of a ship in the middle of winter, nearly freezing to death. Ferencz later became a lawyer and prosecuted Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials, and he was one of the happiest people I came across.
It’s staggering how expectations can alter how you interpret current circumstances.</p>

I have a friend who grew up in abject poverty in Africa. He now works in tech in California. He says to this day he is still blown away when he eats a hot meal. It’s astounding to him how abundant food is in America.</p>
    
    <p> And that’s astounding for me to ponder—he finds immense pleasure in something I don’t think twice about.
In 2007 The New York Times interviewed Gary Kremen, who founded Match.com. At the time, Kremen was forty-three years old and worth $10 million.</p>
    
    <p> That put him in the top half of 1 percent of people in the country,
and probably the top one thousandth of 1 percent of people in the world. In Silicon Valley, however, it made him just another guy. “You’re nobody here at $10 million,” he said. The Times wrote: “He logs 60- to 80-hour workweeks because he does not think he has nearly enough money to ease up.</p>
    
    <p>” There is no such thing as objective wealth—everything is relative, and mostly relative to those around you. It’s the path of least resistance to determining what life owes you and what you should expect. Everyone does it. Subconsciously or not, everyone looks around and says, “What do other people like me have? What do they do? Because that’s what I should have and do as well.</p>
