He once described the people who lived there as the funniest and most interesting people he had ever met. He said he soon realized they weren’t crazy at all. They were, instead, “the smartest people” who had just “seen through the bullshit.” And because of that, “they couldn’t function in the world.</p>
    
    <p>” “They couldn’t hold a job because they just couldn’t take the bullshit,” he said. The rest of the world saw these people as rejects because they couldn’t fit in. But in fact, Pressfield said, they were the geniuses who simply couldn’t stand everyone else’s nonsense.
This reminds me of something I’ve long believed.</p>
    
    <p>
If you recognize that inefficiency—“bullshit,” as Pressfield puts it—is ubiquitous, then the question is not “How can I avoid all of it?” but “What is the optimal amount to put up with so I can still function in a messy and imperfect world?” If your tolerance is zero—if you are allergic to differences in opinion,
personal incentives, emotions, inefficiencies, miscommunication, and such —your odds of succeeding in anything that requires other people rounds to zero. You can’t function in the world, as Pressfield says. The other end of the spectrum—fully accepting every incidence of nonsense and hassle—is just as bad. The world will eat you alive.</p>

What’s easy to miss is that there are bad things that become bigger problems when you try to eliminate them. I think the most successful people recognize when a certain amount of acceptance beats purity. Theft is a good example. A grocery store could eliminate theft by strip-searching every customer leaving the store.</p>
    
    <p> But then no one would shop there. So the optimal level of theft is never zero. You accept a certain level as an inevitable cost of progress.
Inefficiency, in all its forms, is similar.</p>
    
    <p>
A unique skill, an underrated skill, is identifying the optimal amount of hassle and nonsense you should put up with to get ahead while getting along.
Franklin Roosevelt—the most powerful man in the world, whose paralysis meant his aides often had to carry him to the bathroom—once said, “If you can’t use your legs and they bring you milk when you wanted orange juice, you learn to say ‘that’s all right,’ and drink it.” Every industry and career is different, but there’s universal value in accepting hassle when reality demands it.
Volatility.</p>
    
    <p> People having bad days. Office politics. Difficult personalities. Bureaucracy.</p>
    
    <p> All of them are bad. But all have to be endured to some degree if you want to get anything done.
Many managers have little tolerance for nonsense. They think it’s noble.</p>
