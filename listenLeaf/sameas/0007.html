    <p> And it’s now nine p.m. Think about that. It’s nine p.</p>
    
    <p>m. and they have their ski boots on their feet.” It was the first moment everyone looked around and realized how bad this was.
Around ten I was told to go to the Squaw Valley Fire Department, where I met the local search and rescue team.</p>
    
    <p>
I explained everything that Brendan, Bryan, and I did that day. The search team pulled out these giant photo maps that must have been taken from a helicopter. I showed them exactly where we entered the out-of- bounds area.
I told them about the small avalanche that morning.</p>
    
    <p> As soon as I mentioned it I could see the dots connecting in the rescuers’ heads. I remember that when I finished talking two of the rescuers looked at each other and sighed.
In the middle of the night, with giant floodlights and a team of search dogs, the rescuers went looking for Brendan and Bryan.
I later learned that as soon as they entered the out-of-bounds area where I told them we skied, they discovered the fresh scars of a recent avalanche debris field.</p>
    
    <p> It was massive, “like half the mountain had been torn away,” one said.
I drove back to the locker room around midnight. The Squaw Valley parking lot can hold several thousand cars. By this time it was almost empty.</p>
    
    <p> Everyone had gone home, except two cars parked next to each other:
Brendan’s Jeep and Bryan’s Chevy pickup.
— I tried to sleep on a bench in the locker room but couldn’t shut my eyes. I remember thinking Brendan and Bryan would come bounding through the door, and we could laugh about the time I had to call the cops to find them.
By nine a.</p>
    
    <p>m. the locker room was packed with other ski racers, parents,
friends, and family, all eager to help. It became a staging area for the search.
I laid back down on the bench and finally fell asleep.</p>
    
    <p>
A few minutes later I awoke to the sound of a scream, yelling, and commotion.
I knew what had happened. No one needed to say it.
I walked to the second floor of the locker room, where I saw Bryan’s mom on a couch.</p>
