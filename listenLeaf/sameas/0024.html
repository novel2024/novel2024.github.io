This is true for countries, particularly empires. A country determined to expand by acquiring more land is unlikely to be run by a person capable of saying, “Okay, that’s enough. Let’s be thankful for what we have and stop invading other countries.” They’ll keep pushing until they meet their match.</p>

Novelist Stefan Zweig said, “History reveals no instances of a conqueror being surfeited by conquests,” meaning no conqueror gets what they wish and then retires.
Perhaps the most important part of this topic is gaining better insight into who we should look up to, particularly who we want to be and who we want to emulate. Naval Ravikant once wrote:
One day, I realized with all these people I was jealous of, I couldn’t just choose little aspects of their life. I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality.</p>
    
    <p> You have to be that person. Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image? If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.
Either you want someone else’s life or you don’t. Either is equally powerful.</p>
    
    <p> Just know which is which when finding role models.
— “You gotta challenge all assumptions. If you don’t, what is doctrine on day one becomes dogma forever after,” John Boyd once said.
That’s the kind of philosophy you’ll always be remembered for—for better or worse.</p>

Next up: let’s talk a little about how bad people are at math.
J Wild Numbers People don’t want accuracy. They want certainty.
The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.</p>
    
    <p> —BERTRAND RUSSELL erry Seinfeld was once driving around in his car with Jimmy Fallon.
It was an old car, built in the 1950s.
“Do you worry that the car doesn’t have an airbag?” Fallon asked.
“No.</p>
    
    <p> And be honest,” Seinfeld said, “in your whole life how often have you needed an airbag?” It was a joke. But what a perfect example of how hard it is for people to think about probability and uncertainty.
To help his students think about this, Stanford professor Ronald Howard asked them to write a percentage representing the likelihood that they had responded correctly next to each answer on the tests he gave.
If you said you were 100 percent confident that your answer was correct and it turned out to be wrong, you failed the entire test.</p>
    
    <p>
If you said you were zero percent confident and your answer happened to be correct, you got no credit.
Everything in between gave you a confidence-adjusted score.
I’ve never heard of a better way to teach people that life is about managing probabilities. And what an amazing way to scare the daylights out of students, forcing them to realize the consequences of assuming that certainty exists in a world filled with unknowns.</p>
