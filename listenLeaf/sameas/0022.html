    <p> Disobedient. Impatient. He screamed at his superiors to the astonishment of peers, and was once nearly court-martialed for setting ablaze hangars that didn’t have proper heating. In meetings he would chew calluses off his hands and spit the dead skin across the table.</p>
    
    <p>
The Air Force loved, and needed, Boyd’s insights. But they couldn’t stand Boyd the man.
Boyd’s defining trait was that he thought about flying planes through a totally different lens than other pilots. Like he was using a different part of his brain and playing a different game than everyone else.</p>
    
    <p>
That same personality made him naturally indifferent to established customs. So his superiors would, in the same performance report, rave of his contributions but then attempt to block his promotions.
One review said, “This brilliant young officer is an original thinker,” but went on, “He is an intense and impatient man who does not respond well to close supervision. He is extremely intolerant of those who attempt to impede his program.</p>
    
    <p>” While Boyd was writing the definitive book on fighter maneuvers, two colonels denied his promotion.
Boyd was eventually promoted. He was too talented not to be. But throughout his career, no one knew what to do with him.</p>
    
    <p> He pissed off a lot of people. He was unique in every way—good, bad, awful, and occasionally illegal.
— John Maynard Keynes once purchased a trove of Isaac Newton’s original papers at auction.
Many had never been seen before, as they had been stashed away at Cambridge for centuries.</p>

Newton is probably the smartest human to ever live. But Keynes was astonished to find that much of the work was devoted to alchemy, sorcery,
and trying to find a potion for eternal life.
Keynes wrote:
I have glanced through a great quantity of this at least 100,000 words, I should say. It is utterly impossible to deny that it is wholly magical and wholly devoid of scientific value; and also impossible not to admit that Newton devoted years of work to it.</p>
    
    <p>
I wonder: Was Newton a genius in spite of being addicted to magic, or was being curious about things that seemed impossible part of what made him so successful?
I think it’s impossible to know. But the idea that crazy geniuses sometimes just look straight-up crazy is nearly unavoidable.
There’s a scene in the movie Patton in which the actor portraying the legendary World War II general George Patton meets his Russian counterpart after the war. Speaking through an interpreter, the Russian general proposes a toast.</p>
    
    <p>
“My compliments to the general,” Patton says, “but please inform him that I do not care to drink with him or any other Russian son of a bitch.” The interpreter is stunned, and says he can’t relay that message. Patton insists.
The Russian general responds through the interpreter that he thinks Patton is also a son of a bitch.</p>
