The point, then, isn’t that you should read less news and more books. It’s that if you read good books you’ll have an easier time understanding what you should or shouldn’t pay attention to in the news.
Next up: When trying too hard backfires.
L Trying Too Hard There are no points awarded for difficulty.</p>

et’s discuss an enduring quirk of human behavior: the allure of complexity, intellectual stimulation, and discounting things that are simple but very effective, in preference to things that are complex but less effective.
— In 2013 Harold Varmus, then director of the National Cancer Institute, gave a speech describing how difficult the war on cancer had become.
Eradicating cancer—the National Cancer Act’s goal when it was signed in 1971—seemed perpetually distant. Varmus said:
There’s a paradox that we must now honestly confront.</p>
    
    <p>
Despite the extraordinary progress we’ve made in understanding the underlying defects in cancer cells, we have not succeeded in controlling cancer as a human disease to the extent that I believe is possible.
One of the missing pieces, he said, is that we focus too much on cancer treatment and not enough on cancer prevention. If you wanted to get the next big leg up in the war on cancer, you had to make prevention the front line.
But prevention is boring, especially compared to the science and prestige of cancer treatments.</p>
    
    <p> So even if we know how important it is, it’s hard for smart people to take it seriously.
MIT cancer researcher Robert Weinberg once described it this way: You can’t die from cancer if you don’t get cancer in the first place. But that simple truth is easy to overlook, because it’s not intellectually stimulating.
Persuading somebody to quit smoking is a psychological exercise.</p>
    
    <p> It has nothing to do with molecules and genes and cells.
And so people like me are essentially uninterested in it.
That’s in spite of the fact, he says, that getting people to quit smoking can make a bigger impact in the war on cancer than anything he, as a biologist, can do in his lifetime.
It’s astounding, isn’t it?
Here you have one of the top cancer researchers in the world, and he’s saying he could make a bigger impact on cancer if he focused on getting people to quit smoking—but that’s not intellectually stimulating enough for him.</p>
    
    <p> Or for many scientists, for that matter.
Now, I don’t blame him—and Weinberg has added enormous value to the war on cancer.
But here we have an example of complexity being favored for its excitement, when simplicity may actually do a better job.
And that, I’ll tell you, is a big lesson that applies to many things.</p>
    
    <p>
— Computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra once wrote:
Simplicity is the hallmark of truth—we should know better,
but complexity continues to have a morbid attraction. When you give an academic audience a lecture that is crystal clear from alpha to omega, your audience feels cheated. . .</p>
    
    <p> . The sore truth is that complexity sells better.
The sore truth is that complexity sells better.
Of course it does.</p>
