And since experiences will always be different, disagreement will be constant.
Same as it’s ever been.
Same as it will always be.
Same as it ever was.</p>

T Questions he night before the D-Day invasion, Franklin Roosevelt asked his wife, Eleanor, how she felt about not knowing what would happen next.
“To be nearly sixty and still rebel at uncertainty is ridiculous isn’t it?” she said.
It is. But we do.</p>
    
    <p> We always have. We always will.
The idea that what lies in front of us is a dark hole of uncertainty can be so intimidating, it’s easier to believe the opposite—that we can see the future, and that its path is logical and predictable. No belief in history is as commonly held, and no belief is as consistently wrong.</p>
    
    <p>
The typical attempt to clear up an uncertain future is to gaze further and squint harder—to forecast with more precision, more data, and more intelligence.
Far more effective is to do the opposite: Look backward, and be broad.
Rather than attempting to figure out little ways the future might change,
study the big things the past has never avoided.
A decade ago I made a goal to read more history and fewer forecasts.</p>
    
    <p> It was one of the most enlightening changes of my life. And the irony is that the more history I read, the more comfortable I became with the future.
When you focus on what never changes, you stop trying to predict uncertain events and spend more time understanding timeless behavior. Hopefully this book nudged you down that path.</p>

I try not to give advice to people I don’t know, because everyone’s different and universal guidance is rare.
So rather than ending this book with a list of conclusions to implement in your own life, I’ll leave you with a list of questions, all related to the chapters you just read, to ask yourself.
Who has the right answers but I ignore because they’re not articulate?
Which of my current views would I disagree with if I were born in a different country or generation?
What do I desperately want to be true so much that I think it’s true when it’s clearly not?
What is a problem that I think applies only to other countries/industries/careers that will eventually hit me?
What do I think is true but is actually just good marketing?
What haven’t I experienced firsthand that leaves me naive about how something works?
What looks unsustainable but is actually a new trend we haven’t accepted yet?
Who do I think is smart but is actually full of it?
Am I prepared to handle risks I can’t even envision?
Which of my current views would change if my incentives were different?
What are we ignoring today that will seem shockingly obvious in the future?
What events very nearly happened that would have fundamentally changed the world I know if they had occurred?
How much have things outside my control contributed to things I take credit for?
How do I know if I’m being patient (a skill) or stubborn (a flaw)?
Who do I look up to that is secretly miserable?
What hassle am I trying to eliminate that’s actually an unavoidable cost of success?
What crazy genius that I aspire to emulate is actually just crazy?
What strong belief do I hold that’s most likely to change?
What’s always been true?
What’s the same as ever?
Acknowledgments Writing can be a lonely endeavor. It’s just you, the keyboard, and a brain that floats between exciting creativity one moment and doubt the next.</p>

But in some ways the profession is social at its core. Every writer can reflect on how many people they’ve been inspired by, and recognize the dozens or hundreds of other writers, thinkers, researchers, and diverse minds their writing has been shaped by.
A few who have been particularly inspirational and helpful to me,
whether they know it or not:
Carl Richards John Reeves Craig Shapiro Dan Gardner Bethany McLean Kathleen Kimball Matt Koppenheffer Jason Zweig Betty Cossitt Noah Schwartzberg Mollie Glick Mark Pingle Craig Pearce Brian Richards Jenna Abdou Mike Ehrlich Erik Larson Bill Mann Derek Thompson Tom Gaynor Chris Hill Candice Millard Robert Kurson Jung-ju Kim James Clear Frank Housel Sr.
Michael Batnick And of course, my wife, Gretchen, and my parents, Ben and Nancy— whose support and guidance I’d be lost without.</p>
