    <p> We see that everywhere.
To take a simple example: The U.S. Constitution is 7,591 words.</p>
    
    <p>
Compare that to the average mortgage contract, which is over 15,000 words, and Apple’s iCloud terms of service agreement, which is 7,314 words. The U.S. tax code is over 11 million words.</p>
    
    <p>
Sometimes length is necessary. When the Allies met to discuss what to do with Germany after World War II, Winston Churchill noted, “We are dealing with the fate of eighty million people and that requires more than eighty minutes to consider.” But in most situations a handful of simple variables drives the majority of outcomes. If you’ve covered the few things that matter, you’re all set.</p>
    
    <p> A lot of what gets added after that is unnecessary filler that is either intellectually seductive, wastes your time, or is designed to confuse or impress you.
Nature has figured this out.
Samuel Williston was a nineteenth-century paleontologist who first noticed a historic trend in the reduction of body parts. Primitive animals often had many duplicate body parts, then evolution reduced the number but increased their usefulness.</p>
    
    <p> “The course of evolution has been to reduce the number of parts and to adapt those which remain more closely with their special uses, either by increase in size or by modifications of their shape and structure,” Williston wrote in 1914.
Animals with hundreds of teeth often evolved to have a handful of specialized incisors, canines, and molars. Dozens of jawbones fused into two big ones. Skulls often made up of hundreds of tiny bones evolved into typically fewer than thirty.</p>
    
    <p>
Evolution figured out its version of simplification. It (if you can imagine evolution talking) says, “Get all that useless crap out of the way. Just give me the few things I need and make them effective.” A trick to learning a complicated topic is realizing how many complex details are cousins of something simple.</p>
    
    <p> John Reed wrote in his book Succeeding:
When you first start to study a field, it seems like you have to memorize a zillion things. You don’t. What you need is to identify the core principles—generally three to twelve of them— that govern the field. The million things you thought you had to memorize are simply various combinations of the core principles.</p>

This is so vital. In finance, spending less than you make, saving the difference, and being patient is perhaps 90 percent of what you need to know to do well. But what’s taught in college? How to price derivatives and calculate net present value. In health it’s sleep eight hours, move a lot, eat real food, but not too much.</p>
