    <p>  .  . “We must get as efficient as possible to keep costs to the consumer down,” he said. “That’s what made Sears a success, and that’s a rule we must keep in mind.</p>
    
    <p>” And then everything fell to pieces.
Growing income inequality pushed consumers to either bargain or luxury goods, leaving Sears in the shrinking middle. Competition from Walmart and Target—younger and hungrier retailers—took off.
By the late 2000s, Sears was a shell of its former self.</p>
    
    <p> YES, WE ARE OPEN a sign outside my local Sears read—a reminder to customers who had all but written it off.
The story of how Sears lost its competitive advantage is fascinating. But it is not unique. It is in many ways the default outcome of once-dominant companies.</p>
    
    <p>
Going public is a sign that a company has found enough competitive advantage to scale into a large corporation. But almost 40 percent of all public companies lost all their value from 1980 to 2014. The list of top ten Fortune 500 companies that went bankrupt includes General Motors,
Chrysler, Kodak—and Sears. The list of those unrecognizable from their former selves is longer, and includes General Electric, Time Warner, AIG,
and Motorola.</p>
    
    <p> Countries follow similar fates. At various points in the past,
the world’s scientific and economic progress has been dominated by Asia,
Europe, and the Middle East.
Whenever a once powerful thing loses an advantage, it is tempting to ridicule the mistakes of its leaders. But it’s easy to overlook how many forces pull you away from a competitive advantage once you have one,
specifically because you have one.</p>
    
    <p> Success has its own gravity. “The higher the monkey climbs a tree, the more you can see his ass,” oil tycoon T.
Boone Pickens used to say.
Five big things tend to eat away at competitive advantages.</p>
    
    <p>
One is that being right instills confidence that you can’t be wrong, which is a devastating characteristic in a world where outlier success has a target on its back, with competitors in tow. Size is associated with success,
success is associated with hubris, and hubris is the beginning of the end of success.
Another is that success tends to lead to growth, usually by design, but a big organization is a different animal than a small one, and strategies that lead to success at one size can be impossible at another. There is a long history of star investment fund managers from one decade underperforming in the next.</p>
    
    <p> Some of this is the unraveling of luck. But success also attracts capital, and a big investment fund isn’t as nimble as a small one. The career version of this is the Peter Principle: talented workers will keep getting promoted until they’re in over their head, when they fail.
A third is the irony that people often work hard to gain a competitive advantage for the intended purpose of not having to work so hard at some point in the future.</p>
