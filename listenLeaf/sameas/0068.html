Next, one of the wildest stories I know. It’s about another risk that’s easy to ignore: the downside of shortcuts.
L It’s Supposed to Be Hard Everything worth pursuing comes with a little pain. The trick is not minding that it hurts.</p>
    
    <p>
et me share a few ideas about the allure, and danger, of shortcuts.
Few stories make you wince as much as that of the Donner Party.
Eighty-seven people led by the Donner family left Springfield, Illinois,
in 1846 for California, which was then seemingly a world away but held the promise of riches and a new beginning.
The journey was grueling and risky in the best of times, taking several months and under constant threat of attack from Native Americans, disease,
and nasty weather.</p>
    
    <p>
Halfway through the trip the Donners, exhausted from months on the trail, took the advice of an Ohio explorer named Lansford Hastings, who convinced them they could shave perhaps three or four days off their trip by cutting through what is now Utah, bypassing the traditional and well-known trail through what is now southern Idaho.
Hastings was wrong in nearly every regard. The “shortcut” was far longer and more arduous than the traditional route, taking them through the scorching heat of the Great Salt Lake Desert in the middle of summer. The party nearly ran out of water, lost the majority of their oxen, and—most critically—added a month to their journey.</p>
    
    <p>
That delay could not have been more catastrophic.
The Donner Party would now cross the Sierra Nevada mountains near Lake Tahoe in the middle of winter, instead of the late fall as first planned.
The winter of 1847 turned out to be one of the most brutal on record, with the Donners attempting to cross snowdrifts ten to twenty feet high. It was nearly impossible for the group, with more than half of the remaining eighty-one people in the party under age eighteen.</p>
    
    <p> They settled in and waited out the winter as best they could. Before long, starvation set in, and members began dying in droves.
That’s when the survivors of the Donner Party resorted to what would make them famous for the ages: cannibalism.
Flesh from the dead was cut off and meticulously labeled to prevent a survivor from having to eat their own family member.</p>
    
    <p> Georgia Donner, age four during the ordeal, later recalled being fed strange bits of meat: “Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time. . . .</p>
    
    <p> There was nothing else.” All of this, mind you, because they were tempted by a shortcut.
— There’s a scene in the movie Lawrence of Arabia in which Lawrence puts out a match with his fingers and doesn’t flinch. Another man watching tries to do the same and yells in pain.</p>
    
    <p>
“It hurts! What’s the trick, then?” he asks.
“The trick is not minding that it hurts,” Lawrence says.
This is one of the most useful life skills—enduring the pain when necessary rather than assuming there’s a hack, or a shortcut, around it.
A coworker of mine at an old employer once hired a social media consultant.</p>
