    <p> Nothing else is working,
might as well try.” Comedian Trevor Noah once discussed apartheid in his native South Africa, noting: “If you find the right balance between desperation and fear,
you can make people do anything.” It’s just so hard to understand that, and understand how you’ll respond to risk, fear, and desperation, until you’re in the heat of the moment.
Nowhere was this more powerful than in 1930s Germany, where the Great Depression was preceded by devastating hyperinflation that destroyed all paper wealth.</p>

The book What We Knew features interviews with German civilians after World War II, seeking to understand how one of the most advanced and civilized cultures turned so sharp, so quickly, and committed the worst atrocities in human history:
[Interviewer]: At the beginning of this interview, you said that most grown-ups welcomed Hitler’s measures.
[German civilian]: Yes, clearly. One has to remember that in 1923 we had the inflation.  .</p>
    
    <p>  .  . The [currency] had inflated a trillion times. .</p>
    
    <p> . . Then Adolf came to power with his new idea.
For most that was indeed better.</p>
    
    <p> People who hadn’t had a job for years had a job. And then the people were all for the system.
When someone helps you get out of an emergency situation and into a better life, then you’re going to give them your support. Do you think people would then say, “This is all such nonsense.</p>
    
    <p> I’m against that”? No. That doesn’t happen.
Or take Varlam Shalamov, a poet who spent fifteen years imprisoned in a gulag. He once wrote how quickly normal people can crack under stress and uncertainty.</p>
    
    <p> Take a good, honest, loving person and strip them of basic necessities and you’ll soon get an unrecognizable monster who’ll do anything to survive. Under high stress, “a man becomes a beast in three weeks,” Shalamov wrote.
Historian Stephen Ambrose chronicled World War II soldiers who left basic training full of bravado and confidence, eager to fight when they joined the front lines. Then they get shot at, and everything changes.</p>
    
    <p>
“There was no way training could prepare a man for combat,” Ambrose wrote. It could teach you how to fire a gun and follow orders. But “it could not teach men how to lie helpless under a shower of shrapnel in a field crisscrossed by machine-gun fire.” No one could understand it until they experienced it.</p>
