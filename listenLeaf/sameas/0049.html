In the next chapter, let’s look at another timeless topic: how, when, and why people find motivation.
A When the Magic Happens Stress focuses your attention in ways that good times can’t.
constant truth you see throughout history is that the biggest changes and the most important innovations don’t happen when everyone is happy and things are going well. They tend to occur during, and after, a terrible event.</p>
    
    <p> When people are a little panicked, shocked, worried, and when the consequences of not acting quickly are too painful to bear.
— The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire was one of the biggest tragedies in New York City’s history.
On March 25, 1911, a fire broke out in a garment factory staffed with hundreds of mostly immigrant women—many of them young teenagers,
few older than age twenty-two.
Within minutes, the factory was nearly engulfed.</p>
    
    <p>
Firefighters were at the scene soon after. But their ladders could only reach as high as the sixth floor—four stories below the helpless workers.
“Everybody was running, trying to get out,” said Bessie Cohen, a survivor of the fire.
Panicked workers crowded in the building’s windows, searching for the last gasps of oxygen.</p>
    
    <p>
Crowds began congregating on the streets below. What they saw next, no one would ever forget.
One passerby said something that looked like a burning bale of old clothes fell out of the building and hit the ground with a thud. Another commented that they must be throwing burning clothes out the window to try to stop the fire.</p>
    
    <p>
With more thuds, it became apparent that factory workers were jumping to their death.
First one, then a few more, then dozens.
“Thud-dead, thud-dead, thud-dead, thud-dead,” is how one witness described it.
The doors and fire escapes of the factory had been locked shut to prevent workers from taking unscheduled breaks.</p>
    
    <p> When a freight elevator stopped working, jumping became the only way out of the inferno.
“There was this beautiful little girl, my friend, Dora,” Cohen recalled. “I remember her face before she jumped.” The whole tragedy was over in less than thirty minutes.</p>
    
    <p> One hundred and forty-six workers died.
Later that evening, a woman named Frances Perkins, who witnessed the fire from the street below, described to a reporter what she saw.
“They came down in twos and threes, jumping together in a kind of desperate hope,” Perkins said. “The life nets were broken.</p>
    
    <p> The firemen kept shouting for them not to jump. But they had no choice; the flames were right behind them.” Thirty years later, Perkins would be appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as secretary of labor—the first woman member of a presidential cabinet.
Appalled by what she witnessed at the Triangle fire, and how preventable the deaths could have been had the employees had better working conditions—as simple as fire escapes and unlocked doors— Perkins and countless others devoted much of the rest of their lives to fighting for workers’ rights.</p>
