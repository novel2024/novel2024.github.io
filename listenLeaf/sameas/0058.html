— On a related topic: Let me share a story about nuclear bombs to show how easy it is to discount risks.
A Tiny and Magnificent When little things compound into extraordinary things.
common theme in history is that people assume the biggest companies, nations, and innovations pose the biggest threats and create the biggest opportunities.
But that’s usually not how it works.</p>
    
    <p>
A 2010 Yale study showed that one of the leading causes of the increase in obesity is not necessarily people eating larger meals; it’s eating more small snacks throughout the day.
It’s a good example of how lots of things work.
Most catastrophes come from a series of tiny risks—each of which is easy to ignore—that multiply and compound into something huge. The opposite is true: Most amazing things happen when something tiny and insignificant compounds into something extraordinary.</p>

— The Soviets once built a nuclear bomb fifteen hundred times stronger than the one dropped on Hiroshima.
Called Tsar Bomba (king of bombs), it was ten times more powerful than every conventional bomb dropped during World War II combined. When tested in Russia, its fireball was seen six hundred miles away. Its mushroom cloud went forty-two miles into the sky.</p>

Historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote:
The island over which the explosion took place was literally leveled, not only of snow but also of rocks, so that it looked like an immense skating rink. One estimate calculated  .  .  .</p>
    
    <p> the resulting firestorm would have engulfed an area the size of the state of Maryland.
The first nuclear bomb was developed to end World War II. Within a decade we had enough bombs to end the world—all of it.
But there was a weird silver lining to how deadly these bombs were:
countries were unlikely to use them in battle because they raised the stakes so high.</p>
    
    <p> Wipe out an enemy’s capital city and they’ll do the same to you sixty seconds later—so why bother? John F. Kennedy said neither country wanted “a war that would leave not one Rome intact but two Carthages destroyed.” By 1960 we got around this predicament by going the other way. We built smaller, less deadly nuclear bombs.</p>
    
    <p>
One, called Davy Crockett, was 650 times less powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and could be fired from the back of a Jeep. We built nuclear landmines that could fit in a backpack, with a warhead the size of a shoebox.
These tiny nukes felt more responsible, less risky. We could use them without ending the world.</p>
    
    <p>
But they backfired.
Small nuclear bombs were more likely to actually be used in combat.
That was their whole purpose. They lowered the bar of justified use.</p>
