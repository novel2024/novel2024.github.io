    <p> Given that track record, will people ever choose to ignore the experts? “No way,” Tetlock once said. “We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.” The inability to forecast the past has no impact on our desire to forecast the future. Certainty is so valuable that we’ll never give up the quest for it,
and most people couldn’t get out of bed in the morning if they were honest about how uncertain the future is.</p>
    
    <p>
It often takes too long for a sufficient sample size to play out. So everyone is left guessing.
Let’s say you’re a seventy-five-year-old economist. You started your career at age twenty-five.</p>
    
    <p> So you have half a century of experience predicting what the economy will do next. You’re as seasoned as they come.
But how many recessions have there been in the last fifty years?
Seven.
There have only been seven times in your career that you’ve been able to measure your skills.</p>
    
    <p>
If you want to really judge someone’s abilities you would compare dozens, hundreds, or thousands of attempts against reality. But a lot of fields don’t generate that many opportunities to measure. It’s no one’s fault;
it’s just that the reality of the real world is messier than an idealized spreadsheet.
It’s an important quirk, because if someone says there’s an 80 percent chance of a recession, the only way to tell if they’re right is to compare dozens or hundreds of times they made that exact call and see if it came true 80 percent of the time.</p>
    
    <p>
If you don’t have dozens or hundreds of attempts—sometimes you only have one or two—there’s no way to know whether someone who says 75 percent chance of this or 32 percent chance of that is right or not. So we’re all left guessing (or preferring those who profess certainty).
Distinguishing between unfortunate odds and recklessness is hard when risk has painful consequences. It’s easier to see black and white even when the odds are apparent.</p>

I valeted at a hotel in college. Our team parked ten thousand cars a month.
And we banged one of them up every month, like clockwork.
Management found this intolerable.</p>
    
    <p> Every few weeks we’d be scolded for our recklessness.
But one accident in ten thousand parks is pretty good. If you drive twice a day, it’ll take you fourteen years to park ten thousand times. One bent fender every fourteen years is a driving record your insurance company won’t bat an eye at.</p>
    
    <p>
But try explaining that to your boss, who had to file so many damage reports they got to know the insurance claims adjusters by name. You’ll get no sympathy. It’s so much easier to say, “You guys are clearly being reckless. Slow down or you’re fired.</p>
