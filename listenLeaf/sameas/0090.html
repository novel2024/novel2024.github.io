    <p> The few (very few) things that never change are candidates for long-term thinking. Everything else has a shelf life.
Long term is less about time horizon and more about flexibility.
If it’s 2010 and you say “I have a ten-year time horizon,” your target date is 2020.</p>
    
    <p> Which is when the world fell to pieces. If you were a business or an investor it was a terrible time to assume the world was ready to hand you the reward you had been patiently awaiting.
A long time horizon with a firm end date can be as reliant on chance as a short time horizon.
Far superior is flexibility.</p>
    
    <p>
Time is compounding’s magic, and its importance can’t be minimized.
But the odds of success fall deepest in your favor when you mix a long time horizon with a flexible end date—or an indefinite horizon.
Benjamin Graham said, “The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.” The more flexibility you have, the less you need to know what happens next.</p>
    
    <p>
And never forget John Maynard Keynes: “In the long run we’re all dead.” — Another point about long-term thinking is how it sways the information we consume.
I try to ask when I’m reading: Will I care about this a year from now?
Ten years from now? Eighty years from now?
It’s fine if the answer is no, even a lot of the time. But if you’re honest with yourself you may begin to steer toward the more enduring bits of information.</p>
    
    <p>
There are two types of information: permanent and expiring.
Permanent information is: “How do people behave when they encounter a risk they hadn’t fathomed?” Expiring information is: “How much profit did Microsoft earn in the second quarter of 2005?” Expiring knowledge catches more attention than it should, for two reasons.
One, there’s a lot of it, eager to keep our short attention spans occupied.
Two, we chase it down, anxious to squeeze insight out of it before it loses relevance.</p>
    
    <p>
Permanent information is harder to notice because it’s buried in books rather than blasted in headlines. But its benefit is huge. It’s not just that permanent information never expires, letting you accumulate it. It also compounds over time, leveraging off what you’ve already learned.</p>
    
    <p> Expiring information tells you what happened; permanent information tells you why something happened and is likely to happen again. That “why” can translate and interact with stuff you know about other topics, which is where the compounding comes in.
I read newspapers and books every day. I cannot recall one damn thing I read in a newspaper from, say, 2011.</p>
    
    <p> But I can tell you in detail about a few great books I read in 2011 and how they changed the way I think. I’ll remember them forever. I’ll keep reading newspapers. But if I read more books I’d probably develop better filters and frameworks that would help me make better sense of the news.</p>
