    <p> It has no new information, no discoveries. But it’s so well written—he tells such a good story—that it became an instant New York Times bestseller and The Washington Post’s Book of the Year.
There are so many examples of this.
Charles Darwin was not the first to discover evolution; he just wrote the first and most compelling book about it.</p>
    
    <p>
Professor John Burr Williams had more profound insight on the topic of valuing stocks than Benjamin Graham. But Graham knew how to write a good paragraph, so he became the legend and sold millions of books.
Andrew Carnegie said he was as proud of his charm and ability to befriend people as he was of his business acumen. Elon Musk is as skilled at getting investors to believe a vision as he is at engineering.</p>

Everyone knows the story of the sinking of the Titanic, which claimed fifteen hundred lives.
But almost no one ever mentions a word about the 1948 sinking of the Chinese ferryboat SS Kiangya, which claimed nearly four thousand lives.
Or the 1987 sinking of the ferryboat MV Dona Paz, which killed 4,345 people.
Or the capsizing of the MV Le Joola, which claimed 1,863 lives off the coast of Gambia in 2002.</p>
    
    <p>
Perhaps the Titanic sticks out because of its story potential: the famous and wealthy passengers, the firsthand accounts from survivors, and, of course, the eventual blockbuster movie.
The influence of a good story drives you crazy if you assume the world is swayed by facts and objectivity—if you assume the best idea or the largest numbers or the correct answer wins. There’s a devoted group of Harari critics obsessed with showing how unoriginal his work is; Musk is viewed with the same mix of confusion and contempt.
In a perfect world, the importance of information wouldn’t rely on its author’s eloquence.</p>
    
    <p> But we live in a world where people are bored,
impatient, emotional, and need complicated things distilled into easy-to- grasp scenes.
If you look, I think you’ll find that wherever information is exchanged— wherever there are products, companies, careers, politics, knowledge,
education, and culture—the best story wins.
Stephen Hawking once noted of his bestselling physics books:
“Someone told me that each equation I included in the book would halve the sales.” Readers don’t want a lecture; they want a memorable story.</p>
    
    <p>
Winston Churchill was, by most accounts, a mediocre politician. But he was a master storyteller and orator, a savant at getting people’s attention through motivation and provoking emotion—which is what made all the difference during his time in office.
Or take the stock market. The valuation of every company is simply a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.</p>
    
    <p> Some companies are incredibly good at telling stories, and during some eras investors become captivated by the wildest ideas of what the future might bring. If you’re trying to figure out where something is going next, you have to understand more than its technical possibilities. You have to understand the stories everyone tells themselves about those possibilities, because it’s such a big part of the forecasting equation.
Perhaps no one has mastered the art of storytelling better than comedians.</p>
    
    <p> They are the best thought leaders because they understand how the world works, but they want to make you laugh rather than make themselves feel smart. They take insights from psychology, sociology,
politics, and every other dry field and squeeze out amazing stories. That’s why they can sell out arenas while an academic researcher who discovers a great insight about social behavior can go unnoticed.
Mark Twain said, “Humor is a way to show you’re smart without bragging.</p>
