    <p>” And this, I think, is a window into understanding why we yearn for the 1950s, despite today being better by almost any measure.
— Money buys happiness in the same way drugs bring pleasure: incredible if done right, dangerous if used to mask a weakness, and disastrous when no amount is enough.
What was so unique about the 1950s was the ability for people to find financial balance in a way that before and since has felt elusive.
World War II left its mark on America economically and socially.</p>
    
    <p>
Between 1942 and 1945, virtually all wages were set by the National War Labor Board, which favored flatter pay—a smaller gap between low- income and high-income workers—than would otherwise exist.
Part of that philosophy stuck around even after wage controls were lifted. The variance of income between classes that existed before the war shrank dramatically. A few years after the war, historian Frederick Lewis Allen noted that the biggest economic gains in percentage terms had gone to the lowest-earning members of society, considerably closing the gap between rich and poor.</p>

If you look at the 1950s and ask, “What was different that made it feel so great?” this is at least part of your answer. The gap between you and most of the people around you wasn’t that large.
It created an era when it was easy to keep your expectations in check because few people in your social circle lived dramatically better than you did.
Many (but not all) Americans could look around and find that not only were they living comfortable lives, they were living lives that were just about as comfortable as those around them whom they compared themselves to.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s the one thing that distinguishes the 1950s from other eras.
So the comparatively lower wages than those of today felt great because everyone else earned a lower wage too.
The smaller homes felt nice because everyone else lived in smaller homes too.
The lack of health care was acceptable because your neighbors were in the same circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>
Hand-me-downs were acceptable clothes because everyone else wore them.
Camping was an adequate vacation because that’s what everyone else did.
It was the one modern era when there wasn’t much social pressure to increase your expectations beyond your income. Economic growth accrued straight to happiness.</p>
    
    <p> People weren’t just better off; they felt better off.
And it was short-lived, of course.
By the early 1980s, the postwar togetherness that dominated the 1950s and ’60s gave way to more stratified growth, where many people plodded along while a few grew exponentially wealthier. The glorious lifestyles of the few inflated the aspirations of the many.</p>

Rockefeller never yearned for Advil because he didn’t know it existed.
But social media today adds a new element, in which everyone in the world can see the lifestyles—often inflated, faked, and airbrushed—of other people. You compare yourself to your peers through a curated highlight reel of their lives, where positives are embellished and negatives are hidden from view. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt says people don’t really communicate on social media so much as they perform for one another.</p>
    
    <p> You see the cars other people drive, the homes they live in, the expensive schools they go to. The ability to say, I want that, why don’t I have that?
Why does he get it but I don’t? is so much greater now than it was just a few generations ago.
Today’s economy is good at generating three things: wealth, the ability to show off wealth, and great envy for other people’s wealth.
It’s become so much easier in recent decades to look around and say, “I may have more than I used to.</p>
