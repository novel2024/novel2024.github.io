Then silence. That was the end of the conversation.
This is a book of short stories about what never changes in a changing world.
History is filled with surprises no one could have seen coming.</p>
    
    <p> But it’s also filled with so much timeless wisdom.
If you traveled in time to five hundred years ago or five hundred years from now, you would be astounded at how much technology and medicine has changed. The geopolitical order would make no sense to you. The language and dialect might be completely foreign.</p>
    
    <p>
But you’d notice people falling for greed and fear just like they do in our current world.
You’d see people persuaded by risk, jealousy, and tribal affiliations in ways that are familiar to you.
You’d see overconfidence and shortsightedness that remind you of people’s behavior today.
You’d find people seeking the secret to a happy life and trying to find certainty when none exists in ways that are entirely relatable.</p>
    
    <p>
When transported to an unfamiliar world, you’d spend a few minutes watching people behave and say, “Ah. I’ve seen this before. Same as ever.” Change captures our attention because it’s surprising and exciting.</p>
    
    <p> But the behaviors that never change are history’s most powerful lessons,
because they preview what to expect in the future. Your future. Everyone’s future. No matter who you are, where you’re from, how old you are, or how much money you make, there are timeless lessons from human behavior that are some of the most important things you can ever learn.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s a simple idea, but it’s so easy to overlook. And once you grasp it,
you’ll be able to make better sense of your own life, understand why the world is the way it is, and become more at ease with what the future has in store.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said that he’s often asked what’s going to change in the next ten years. “I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next ten years?’  ” he said.</p>
    
    <p> “And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two.” Things that never change are important because you can put so much confidence into knowing how they’ll shape the future. Bezos said it’s impossible to imagine a future where Amazon customers don’t want low prices and fast shipping—so he can put enormous investment into those things.
The same philosophy works in almost all areas of life.</p>
    
    <p>
I have no clue what the stock market will do next year (or any year). But I’m very confident about people’s penchant for greed and fear, which never changes. So that’s what I spend my time thinking about.
I have no idea who will win the next presidential election.</p>
