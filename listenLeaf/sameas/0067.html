The most efficient calendar in the world—one where every minute is packed with productivity—comes at the expense of curious wandering and uninterrupted thinking, which eventually become the biggest contributors to success.
Another form of helpful inefficiency is a business whose operations have some slack built in.
Just-in-time manufacturing—where companies don’t stock the parts they need to build products, relying instead on last-minute shipments of components—was the epitome of efficient operations over the last twenty years. Then COVID-19 hit, supply chains broke, and virtually every manufacturer found itself dreadfully short of what it needed.</p>
    
    <p>
The irony is deep: In 2022, during one of the biggest consumer spending booms in history, car companies had to shut down factories because they were short on chips, brakes, and paint. They had no room for error.
Business’s goal was no room for error—and it completely backfired. A little inefficiency across the whole supply chain would have been the sweet spot.</p>
    
    <p> Room for error is often viewed as a cost, an anchor, an inefficiency.
But in the long run it can have some of the highest payoffs imaginable.
Same in investing. Cash is an inefficient drag during bull markets and as valuable as oxygen during bear markets.</p>
    
    <p> Leverage is the most efficient way to maximize your balance sheet and the easiest way to lose everything.
Concentration is the best way to maximize returns, but diversification is the best way to increase the odds of owning a company capable of delivering returns. On and on.
If you’re honest with yourself, you’ll see that a little inefficiency is the ideal spot to be in.</p>
    
    <p>
Same with analysis. There’s an investing quip that it’s better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. But where does the intellectual effort go in the investment industry? Toward the pursuit of precisions— decimal-point exactness that deludes people into thinking they’re not leaving opportunity on the table, when more often they are leaving no room for error for their analysis to be wrong.
Investing in your long-term future is of course great, because the odds that the economy will become more productive and more valuable are pretty good.</p>
    
    <p> But trying to predict the exact path we’ll take to get there can be such a waste of resources.
I describe my forecasting model as “good enough.” I’m confident people will solve problems and become more productive over time.
I’m confident markets will allocate the rewards of that productivity to investors over time.</p>
    
    <p>
I’m confident in other people’s overconfidence, so I know there will be mistakes and accidents and booms and busts along the way.
It’s not detailed, but it’s good enough.
When you keep forecasting that simple, you free up time and bandwidth for other activities. I like studying the investing behaviors that never change, and I’d never have the time to do that if I spent my day predicting what the economy will do next quarter.</p>
    
    <p> The same is true in virtually every field. The more precise you try to be, the less time you have to focus on big-picture rules that are probably more important. It’s less about admitting that we can’t forecast, and more about acknowledging that if your forecast is merely good enough, you can invest your time and resources more efficiently elsewhere.
Just like evolution, the key is realizing that the more perfect you try to become, the more vulnerable you generally are.</p>
