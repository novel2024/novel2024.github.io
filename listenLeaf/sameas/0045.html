The only way to know we’ve exhausted all potential opportunity from markets—the only way to identify the top—is to push them not only past the point where the numbers stop making sense, but beyond the stories people believe about those numbers.
When a tire company develops a new tire and wants to know its limitations, the process is simple. They put it on a car and run it until it blows up. Markets, desperate to know the limits of what other investors can endure, do the same thing.</p>

Always been the case, always will be.
There are two things you can do about it.
One is accepting that crazy doesn’t mean broken. Crazy is normal;
beyond the point of crazy is normal.</p>

Every few years there seems to be a declaration that markets don’t work anymore—that they’re all speculation or detached from fundamentals. But it’s always been that way. People haven’t lost their minds; they’re just searching for the boundaries of what other investors are willing to believe.
The second is realizing the power of enough.</p>
    
    <p> Being more like Seinfeld.
Investor Chamath Palihapitiya was once asked about earning the highest returns, and remarked:
I would really love to just compound at fifteen percent per year. Because if I can do that for fifty years that’s just enormous.
Just slow and steady against hard problems.</p>

Maybe there’s more potential out there, but it’s fine to say, “You know what, I’m pretty happy with this level of risk and I’m fine just watching this game play out.” Not everyone can do it—and markets on average can never do it—but more of us should try.
Next, let’s talk about another wild problem: people’s tendency to want to make good things bigger and faster.
W Too Much, Too Soon, Too Fast A good idea on steroids quickly becomes a terrible idea.</p>

arren Buffett once joked that you can’t make a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.
You’d be surprised, though, how common it is for people to attempt to speed up a process beyond what it can handle.
Whenever people discover something valuable—particularly a lucrative investment or a special skill—there is a tendency to ask, “Great, but can I have it all faster?” Can we push it twice as hard? Can we make it twice the size? Can we squeeze some more juice out of it?
It’s a natural question, and understandable.
But the history of taking something valuable and pushing it too far,
trying to make it go too fast, and asking too much, is long.</p>
    
    <p>
Most things have a natural size and speed and backfire quickly when you push them beyond that.
— Let me tell you about Robert Wadlow. He was enormous, the largest human ever known.
A pituitary gland abnormality bombarded Wadlow’s body with growth hormone, leading to staggering size.</p>
    
    <p> He was six feet tall at age seven, seven feet tall by age eleven, and when he died at twenty-two stood an inch shy of nine feet, weighed five hundred pounds, and wore size 37 shoes. His hand was a foot wide.
He was what fiction would portray as a superhuman athlete, capable of running faster, jumping higher, lifting more weight, and crushing more bad guys than any normal person. A real-life Paul Bunyan.</p>
