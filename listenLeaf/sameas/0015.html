Most of the time, when someone’s caught unprepared, it’s not because they didn’t plan. Sometimes it’s the smartest planners in the world, working tirelessly, mapping every scenario they can imagine, who end up failing.
They planned for everything that made sense before getting hit by something they’d never imagined.
— Harry Houdini used to invite the strongest man in the audience onstage.</p>
    
    <p>
Then he’d ask the man to punch him in the stomach as hard as he could.
Houdini was an amateur boxer and told crowds he could withstand any man’s punch with barely a flinch. The stunt matched what people loved about his famous escapes: the idea that his body could conquer physics.
After a show in 1926 Houdini invited a group of students backstage to meet him.</p>
    
    <p> One, a guy named Gordon Whitehead, walked up and started punching Houdini in the stomach without warning.
Whitehead didn’t mean any harm. He thought he was just recreating the same trick he’d just seen Houdini perform.
But Houdini wasn’t prepared to be punched like he would be onstage.</p>
    
    <p>
He wasn’t flexing his solar plexus, steadying his stance, and holding his breath like he normally would before the trick. Whitehead caught him off guard. Houdini waved him off, clearly suffering.
The next day Houdini woke up doubled over in pain.</p>
    
    <p>
His appendix was ruptured, almost certainly from Whitehead’s punches.
And then Harry Houdini died.
He was probably the most talented person in history at surviving big risks. Tie him up in chains and throw him into a river? No problem.</p>
    
    <p> Bury him alive in sand? No issue, he could escape in seconds—because he had a plan.
But a little jab from a student that he didn’t see coming and wasn’t prepared for?
That was the biggest risk.
What you don’t see coming always is.
Next, let’s chat about our expectations, and the tragedy of a life where almost everything gets better but happiness goes nowhere.</p>
    
    <p>
Y Expectations and Reality The first rule of happiness is low expectations.
our happiness depends on your expectations more than anything else.
So in a world that tends to get better for most people most of the time,
an important life skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. It’s also one of the hardest.</p>
    
    <p>
A common storyline of history goes like this: Things get better, wealth increases, technology brings new efficiencies, and medicine saves lives.
The quality of life goes up. But people’s expectations then rise by just as much, if not more, because those improvements also benefit other people around you, whose circumstances you anchor to. Happiness is little changed despite the world improving.</p>
