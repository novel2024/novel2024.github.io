How could you . .</p>
    
    <p> . ?” “Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.” The first step toward accepting that some things don’t compute is realizing that the reason we have innovation and advancement is because we are fortunate to have people in this world whose minds work differently from ours.</p>
    
    <p>
It would be great if the world worked in predictable, rational ways. But constant uncertainty, misunderstanding, and the inability to know what people will do next is the truth. Author Robert Greene once wrote, “The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces.” It’s what causes us to overlook that the world is not one big spreadsheet whose outputs can be computed.</p>
    
    <p> We’d never get anywhere if everyone viewed the world as a clean set of rational rules to follow.
The next is accepting that what’s rational to one person can be crazy to another. Everything would compute if everyone had the same time horizon,
goals, ambitions, and risk tolerances. But they don’t.</p>
    
    <p> Panic-selling stocks after they’ve declined 5 percent is a terrible idea if you’re a long-term investor, and a career imperative if you’re a professional trader. There is no world in which every business or investing decision you see other people make will align with your own hopes and dreams of how things should be.

    <p> They delude not only their customers but themselves.
Last is the power of stories over statistics. “Housing prices in relation to median incomes are now above their historic average and typically mean revert” is a statistic. “Jim just made $500,000 flipping homes and can now retire early and his wife thinks he’s amazing” is a story.</p>
    
    <p> And it’s way more persuasive in the moment.
It’s hard to compute, but it’s how the world works.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at life’s guaranteed ability to swing from one absurdity to the next.
T Calm Plants the Seeds of Crazy Crazy doesn’t mean broken.</p>
    
    <p> Crazy is normal; beyond the point of crazy is normal.
here is a very common life cycle of greed and fear. It goes like this:
First you assume good news is permanent.
Then you become oblivious to bad news.</p>
