— More than thirty million people—about the population of California—died over four years on the eastern front during World War II. The dozen or so territories that made up the Soviet Republic represented about 10 percent of the world’s population in 1940. By 1945, nearly 14 percent of that group was dead. Seventy thousand villages were completely destroyed.</p>

There are stories of people still finding bones, bullets, and bombs in this region today, but most of the physical damage of the war was cleaned up by 1960. Industries rebuilt. People reorganized. Total population surpassed its prewar level less than a decade after the war ended.</p>
    
    <p>
This trend was more noticeable in Japan, whose economy opened up to global markets after the war. In 1946 Japan was producing enough food to provide only 1,500 calories a day for its people. By 1960 it was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Its GDP increased from $91 billion in 1965 to $1.</p>
    
    <p>1 trillion in 1980, with technology and manufacturing rivaling and surpassing any other region in the world.
The same is true for recessions—things heal. And markets—things recover. And businesses—past mistakes are forgotten.</p>

But scars last.
A study of twenty thousand people from thirteen countries who lived through World War II found they were 3 percent more likely to have diabetes as adults and 6 percent more likely to suffer depression. Compared to those who avoided the war, they were less likely to marry and less satisfied with their lives as older adults.
In 1952, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote about those who lived through the Great Depression:
[They] were gnawed at by a constant lurking fear of worse things yet, and in all too many cases actually went hungry.</p>
    
    <p> . . .
[They cast] a cynical eye upon the old Horatio Alger formula for success; to be dubious about taking chances for ambition’s sake; to look with a favorable eye upon a safe if unadventurous job, social insurance plans, pension plans.</p>
    
    <p> They had learned from bitter experience to crave security.
They had learned from bitter experience to crave security.
This, again, was written in the 1950s, when the U.S.</p>
    
    <p> economy was roaring and the unemployment rate was near a record low of less than 3 percent.
It is too easy to examine history and say, “Look, if you just held on and took a long-term view, things recovered and life went on,” without realizing that mindsets are harder to repair than buildings and cash flows.
We can see and measure just about everything in the world except people’s moods, fears, hopes, grudges, goals, triggers, and expectations.
That’s partly why history is such a continuous chain of baffling events, and always will be.</p>
