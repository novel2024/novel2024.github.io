That’s the period in which markets nearly always reward your patience. The more your time horizon compresses, the more you rely on luck and tempt ruin.
Go down the list of historical investing blunders, and I’m telling you, no less than 90 percent of them are caused by investors trying to compress this natural, “most convenient” time horizon.
The same thing happens to companies.</p>
    
    <p>
Starbucks had 425 stores in 1994, its twenty-third year in existence. In 1999 it opened 625 new stores. By 2007 it was opening 2,500 stores per year—a new coffee shop every four hours.
One thing led to another.</p>
    
    <p> The need to hit growth targets eventually elbowed out rational analysis. Examples of Starbucks saturation became a joke. Same-store sales growth fell by half as the rest of the economy boomed.
Howard Schultz wrote to senior management in 2007: “In order to go from less than 1,000 stores to 13,000 stores we have had to make a series of decisions that, in retrospect, have led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience.</p>
    
    <p>” Starbucks closed six hundred stores in 2008 and laid off twelve thousand employees. Its stock fell 73 percent, which was dreadful even by 2008 standards.
Schultz wrote in his 2011 book Onward: “Growth, we now know all too well, is not a strategy. It is a tactic.</p>
    
    <p> And when undisciplined growth became a strategy, we lost our way.” There was a most convenient size for Starbucks—there is for all businesses. Push past it and you realize that revenue might scale but disappointed customers scale faster, in the same way Robert Wadlow became a giant but struggled to walk.
Tire tycoon Harvey Firestone understood this well, and wrote in 1926:
It does not pay to try to get the business all at once.</p>
    
    <p> In the first place, you can’t get it, so a good deal of your money is thrown away. In the second place, if you did get it, the factory could not handle it. And in the third place, if you did get it, you could not hold it. A company that gets business too quickly acts just about as a boy does who gets money too quickly.</p>
    
    <p>
Corporate mergers often fall for the same trap. Growth by acquisition often occurs when management wants faster growth than customers think the business deserves. The customers’ desire is likely closer to the “most convenient” size of a business, and force-feeding beyond that point leads to all kinds of disappointment.
Nassim Taleb says he’s a libertarian at the federal level, a Republican at the state level, a Democrat at the local level, and a socialist at the family level.</p>
    
    <p> People handle risk and responsibility in totally different ways when a group scales from 4 people to 100 to 100,000 to 100 million.
Same for corporate culture. A management style that works brilliantly at a ten-person company can destroy a thousand-person company, which is a hard lesson to learn when some companies grow that fast in a few short years. Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, is a great example.</p>
