Then you ignore bad news.
Then you deny bad news.
Then you panic at bad news.
Then you accept bad news.</p>
    
    <p>
Then you assume bad news is permanent.
Then you become oblivious to good news.
Then you ignore good news.
Then you deny good news.</p>
    
    <p>
Then you accept good news.
Then you assume good news is permanent.
And we’re back where we began. The cycle repeats.</p>
    
    <p>
Let’s dig deeper on why this cycle happens, and why it always will.
— The 1960s were a period of scientific optimism. In the previous fifty years the world had gone from horse and buggy to rockets, and from bloodletting to organ transplants.
This caused a push among economists to try to eradicate the scourge of recessions.</p>
    
    <p> If we could launch intercontinental ballistic missiles and walk on the moon, surely we could prevent two quarters of negative GDP growth.
Hyman Minsky, who spent most of his career as an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, was fascinated by the boom-and-bust nature of economies. He also thought the idea of eradicating recessions was nonsense, and always would be.</p>
    
    <p>
Minsky’s seminal theory was called the financial instability hypothesis.
The idea isn’t heavy on math and formulas. It describes a psychological process that basically goes like this:
• When an economy is stable, people get optimistic.
• When people get optimistic, they go into debt.</p>
    
    <p>
• When they go into debt, the economy becomes unstable.
Minsky’s big idea was that stability is destabilizing.
A lack of recessions actually plants the seeds of the next recession,
which is why we can never get rid of them.
“Over periods of prolonged prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that make for a stable system to financial relations that make for an unstable system,” he wrote.</p>
    
    <p>
A growing belief that things will be okay pushes us—like a law of physics—toward something not going okay.
This applies to so many things.
Imagine a world where the stock market never went down. Market stability is all but assured, and stocks only go up.</p>
