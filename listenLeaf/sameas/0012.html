But Fisher was a smart guy. And he wasn’t alone.
In an interview years ago I asked Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on bubbles, about the inevitability of the Great Depression. He responded:
Well, nobody forecasted that.</p>
    
    <p> Zero. Nobody. Now there were,
of course, some guys who were saying the stock market is overpriced. But if you look at what they said, did that mean a depression is coming? A decade-long depression? No one said that.</p>
    
    <p>
I have asked economic historians to give me the name of someone who predicted the depression, and it comes up zero.
That stuck with me. Here we are today, blessed with hindsight, knowing the crash after the Roaring Twenties was obvious and inevitable. But for those who lived through it—people for whom the 1930s was a yet-to-be- discovered future—it was anything but.</p>
    
    <p>
Two things can explain something that looks inevitable but wasn’t predicted by those who experienced it at the time:
• Either everyone in the past was blinded by delusion.
• Or everyone in the present is fooled by hindsight.
We are crazy to think it’s all the former and none of the latter.
The Economist—a magazine I admire—publishes a forecast of the year ahead each January.</p>
    
    <p> Its January 2020 issue does not mention a single word about COVID-19. Its January 2022 issue does not mention a single word about Russia invading Ukraine.
That’s not a criticism—both events were impossible to know when the issues were planned in the months before publication.
But that’s the point: The biggest news, the biggest risks, the most consequential events are always what you don’t see coming.</p>
    
    <p>
Put another way: There is rarely more or less economic uncertainty; just changes in how ignorant people are to potential risks. Asking what the biggest risks are is like asking what you expect to be surprised about. If you knew what the biggest risk was you would do something about it, and doing something about it would make it less risky. What your imagination can’t fathom is the dangerous stuff, and it’s why risk can never be mastered.</p>
    
    <p>
I can promise you that will be the case going forward. The biggest risk and the most important news story of the next ten years will be something nobody is talking about today. No matter what year you’re reading this book, that truth will remain. I can say that confidently because it’s always been true.</p>
    
    <p> The fact that you can’t see it coming is exactly what makes it risky.
Even for something as giant as the Great Depression, many people were blind to what was happening even when it was well under way.
The Depression, as we know today, began in 1929. But when the well- informed members of the National Economic League were polled in 1930 as to what they considered the biggest problem of the United States, they listed, in order:
