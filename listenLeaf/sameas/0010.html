    <p> and so on forever.
— Every current event—big or small—has parents, grandparents, great- grandparents, siblings, and cousins. Ignoring that family tree can muddy your understanding of events, giving a false impression of why things happened, how long they might last, and under what circumstances they might occur again. Viewing events in isolation, without an appreciation of their long roots, helps explain everything from why forecasting is hard to why politics is nasty.</p>
    
    <p>
People like to say, “To know where we’re going, you have to know where we’ve been.” But more realistic is admitting that if you know where we’ve been, you realize we have no idea where we’re going. Events compound in unfathomable ways.
I try to keep two things in mind in a world that’s this vulnerable to chance and accident.</p>
    
    <p>
One is highlighting this book’s premise—to base predictions on how people behave rather than on specific events. Predicting what the world will look like fifty years from now is impossible. But predicting that people will still respond to greed, fear, opportunity, exploitation, risk, uncertainty, tribal affiliations, and social persuasion in the same way is a bet I’d take.
Forecasting events is hard because it’s easy to skip the question “And then what?” Saying “Higher gas prices will cause people to drive less” seems logical.</p>
    
    <p>
But then what?
Well, people have to drive, so maybe they’ll look for more fuel-efficient vehicles. They’ll complain to politicians, who will offer tax breaks to buy those vehicles. OPEC is asked to drill more; energy entrepreneurs innovate.
And the oil industry knows two speeds: boom and bust.</p>
    
    <p> So they’ll probably pump too much. Then prices fall, all while people own more efficient vehicles. Then maybe the suburbs become more popular—and people end up driving even more than before.
So who knows.</p>
    
    <p>
Every event creates its own offspring, which impact the world in their own special ways. It makes prediction exceedingly hard. The absurdity of past connections should humble your confidence in predicting future ones.
The other thing to keep in mind is to have a wider imagination.</p>
    
    <p> No matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today,
everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one’s thinking about. Events, like money, compound. And the central feature of compounding is that it’s never intuitive how big something can grow from a small beginning.
Next, let me tell you another old story showing how easy it is to ignore risks.</p>
    
    <p>
I Risk Is What You Don’t See We are very good at predicting the future, except for the surprises—which tend to be all that matter.
t’s well-known that people are bad at predicting the future.
But this misses an important nuance: We are very good at predicting the future, except for the surprises—which tend to be all that matter.
The biggest risk is always what no one sees coming, because if no one sees it coming, no one’s prepared for it; and if no one’s prepared for it, its damage will be amplified when it arrives.</p>
