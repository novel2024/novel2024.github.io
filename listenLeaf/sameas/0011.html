A quick story about a guy who learned this the hard way.
— Before launching themselves into space on rockets, NASA astronauts ran tests in high-altitude hot-air balloons.
A balloon flight on May 4, 1961, took American Victor Prather and another pilot to 113,720 feet, scraping the edge of space. The goal was to test NASA’s new space suit.</p>
    
    <p>
The flight was a success. The suit worked beautifully.
As Prather descended back to earth, he opened the faceplate on his helmet when he was low enough to breathe on his own, ostensibly to catch some fresh air.
He landed in the ocean as planned, where a helicopter was to pull him to safety.</p>
    
    <p> But there was a small mishap: While connecting himself to the helicopter’s rescue line, Prather slipped, falling into the ocean.
This shouldn’t have been that big a deal, and no one in the rescue helicopter panicked. The space suit should have been watertight and buoyant.
But since Prather had opened his faceplate, he was now exposed to the elements.</p>
    
    <p> Water rushed into his suit. Prather drowned.
Think of how much planning goes into launching someone into space.
So much expertise, so many contingencies.</p>
    
    <p> So many what-ifs and what- thens. Every detail is contemplated by thousands of experts. NASA is probably the most planning-centric organization that has ever existed; you don’t go to the moon by crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.
Every conceivable risk has a plan A, plan B, plan C.</p>
    
    <p>
But even then—despite so much planning—a tiny thing no one had considered invites catastrophe.
As financial advisor Carl Richards says, “Risk is what’s left over after you think you’ve thought of everything.” That’s the real definition of risk—what’s left over after you’ve prepared for the risks you can imagine.
Risk is what you don’t see.</p>

— Look at the big news stories that move the needle—COVID-19, 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Great Depression. Their common trait isn’t necessarily that they were big; it’s that they were surprises, on virtually no one’s radar until they arrived.
“After booms come busts” is about as close to economic law as it gets.
Study history, and the calamity that followed the booming 1920s, late 1990s, and early 2000s seems more than obvious.</p>
    
    <p> It seems inevitable.
In October 1929—the peak of history’s craziest stock bubble and the eve of the Great Depression—economist Irving Fisher famously told an audience that “stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” We look at these comments today and laugh. How could someone so smart be so blind to something so inevitable? If you follow the rule that the crazier the boom, the harder the bust, the Great Depression must have been obvious.</p>
