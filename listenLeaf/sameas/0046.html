But that was not Wadlow’s life at all.
He required steel leg braces to stand and a cane to walk. His walk wasn’t much more than a limp, requiring tremendous effort. What few videos of Wadlow exist show a man whose movements are strained and awkward.</p>
    
    <p> He was rarely seen standing on his own, and usually leaned on a wall for support. So much pressure was put on his legs that near the end of his life he had little feeling below his knees. Had Wadlow lived longer and kept growing, casual walking would have caused his leg bones to break. What actually killed him was nearly as grim: Wadlow had high blood pressure in his legs due to his heart straining to pump blood around his enormous body,
which caused an ulcer, which led to a deadly infection.</p>

You can’t triple the size of a human and expect triple the performance— the mechanics don’t work like that. Huge animals tend to have short,
squatty legs (rhinos), or extremely long legs relative to their torso (giraffes).
Wadlow grew too large given the structure of the human body. There are limits to scaling.</p>
    
    <p>
Writing before Wadlow’s time, biologist J. B. S. Haldane once showed how many things this scaling issue applies to.</p>
    
    <p>
A flea can jump two feet in the air, an athletic man about four. But if a flea were as large as a man, it would not be able to jump thousands of feet —it doesn’t scale like that. Air resistance would be far greater for the giant flea, and the amount of energy needed to jump a given height is proportional to weight. If a flea were a thousand times its normal size, its hop might increase from two feet to perhaps six, Haldane assumed.</p>

A human exiting a bathtub has perhaps a pound of water dripping off them—no big deal. A wet mouse, on the other hand, must lug around its body weight in excess water, and a wet fly is effectively pinned to the ground. The same action at different sizes produces massively different problems.
“For every type of animal there is a most convenient size, and a change in size inevitably carries with it a change of form,” Haldane wrote.</p>
    
    <p>
A most convenient size.
A proper state where things work well but break when you try to scale them to a different size or speed.
It applies to so many things in life.
— A good summary of investing history is that stocks pay a fortune in the long run but seek punitive damages when you demand to be paid sooner.</p>
    
    <p>
Here’s how often the U.S. stock market has generated a positive return based on how long you held stocks for.
One way to think about this chart is that there’s a “most convenient” investing time horizon—probably somewhere around ten years or more.</p>
