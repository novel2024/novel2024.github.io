    <p> Similarly, combining ingredients usually requires some form of utensil or appliance--for example, a knife, a bowl, a spoon, an oven, a burner, etc.
This means that the entire process of following specific recipes and using specific utensils and appliances to combine specific ingredients into specific meals which supply all the required nutrients builds a complex system (see Building blocks), which provides flexibility and room for optimization (see Construction methods).
Optimizing ingredients There are plenty of different diets out there. By diet I simply mean a particular way of eating; not necessarily with the goal of losing weight or even maintaining any kind of consistency.</p>
    
    <p> Diet seems to be a personal choice based on physiology and habit. I'm not going to recommend anything in particular, other than not eating too much or building towards downstream health problems from a junk diet. Given a diet, ingredients can be chosen in the following ways:
Spontaneous (no recipe) Shopping list (recipes before ingredients) Staples and opportunism (ingredients before recipes) "Spontaneous" food shopping happens without any particular strategy.
The mission is to get something to eat.</p>
    
    <p> Often this leads to ready-to-eat meals or ordering a pizza. This is an inefficient way to spend resources, and because it's inefficient, it's expensive.
Shopping with a list is perhaps the most popular way of shopping. A meal plan is selected and a shopping list is created, based upon which ingredients are needed.</p>
    
    <p> Economically, this is better than spontaneous shopping because it tends to avoid the TV dinners, but it's still not optimal because it doesn't take sales into account. Missing ingredients are bought regardless of their cost.
The most optimal method is to shop for ingredients, and then, based on the ingredients one has available, determine a recipe. This allows one to buy food on sale, typically loss-leaders.</p>
    
    <p> The supermarket's sales strategy thus drives what's for dinner. To make this work, it's necessary to have some staples on hand (say pasta and beans) which the loss-leaders (say tomatoes,
zucchini, and minced meat) can be combined with. If you pay attention,
you'll notice that loss-leaders are typically on rotation; something on sale now will be on sale again in the future. Wait for it and eat whatever else is on sale in the meantime.</p>
    
    <p>
Creating a pantry of staples works on exactly the same principles as creating a wardrobe (see How to build a wardrobe). Here the ingredients are to the recipes what clothes in the wardrobe are to outfits. Of course, it's possible to write out the solution, but it's likely to require more paper than the wardrobe. Another way is to use websites like supercook.</p>
    
    <p>com to do it.
The traditional best way is to learn several recipes and notice which ingredients they have in common. If one recipe includes an ingredient that is used in only that recipe, avoid the recipe. The more it's optimized, the easier it is to manage the system, but obviously there are diminishing returns to obsessing over which recipes have the most synergy.</p>
    
    <p>
Another way to sort through your existing ingredients (a method that also work for utensils, incidentally) is to set aside a table in your kitchen for a month and put any ingredient on the table once you're done using it rather than putting it back. After a month, anything still left in the cupboards are ingredients you practically never use (see How to get rid of things).
As mentioned above (see A comfortable addiction), if a brand needs advertising, it is probably because it is either difficult to tell the difference between it and another brand or because you would not otherwise want to buy the product in the first place. None of the ingredients I use seem to come with coupons, and so I don't clip coupons.</p>
