    <p> Rather, it results in more being done. For instance, thanks to the washing machine, clothes are now washed more than ever before, and as a result households spend as much time doing laundry as they did before washers moved into people's homes.14 It seems to be a tragicomic fact that every time-saving invention is immediately canceled out by an increase in activity or a change of behavior. When the automobile was made affordable to the masses, people moved further away from work and further away from stores.</p>
    
    <p> While transportation speed increased,
transportation distance increased proportionally, keeping transportation time constant. It did, however, result in the creation of the auto industry, and thus created jobs.
On the surface, job creation may look positive, but all it has accomplished is to replace a previously simple and noneconomic activity,
such as walking, with an entire industry of building cars, highways, and oil rigs to accomplish the same task of getting between places. Cars can go many places, but most trips can just as easily be done in an hour of walking by choosing one's home location wisely (see How to find shelter).</p>
    
    <p> If you wish to go further, there are other means as well.
Many other activities which people used to do themselves have also been turned into products. Consequently, people spend time working to buy products rather than learning and doing the activity themselves. The result is a downward spiral of fewer skills -> greater need for technology -> more work -> less time to practice the remaining skills -> further loss of competence.</p>
    
    <p> The more things consumers think they need, the more control they relinquish over their lives and the more their lives are shaped by the products they own. Thanks to the focus on technology, many skills have been forgotten--eggs can't be boiled without egg boilers, bread can't be toasted without a toaster, and the counter can't be cleaned without dye- colored chemical products. Walking five miles is now considered an ordeal to be avoided. Nobody with a conventional frame of mind would spend one hour walking every day when they could drive.</p>
    
    <p> Yet people don't stop to reconsider spending 10 weeks each year working full-time to pay for that car just to avoid the inconvenience of a daily hour of "laborious" walking and fresh air.
This idea of economic growth seems to be a very intricate version of digging holes and filling them up again. It creates economic growth in the traditional sense, but so does breaking a window and replacing it. What is ignored are wasted effort and natural resources, which should be subtracted from the growth calculation to reveal a more accurate number of how well people, not the "economy," are doing.</p>

The problem with personal finance Finance is the process of exchanging cash flows between one period in time and another through the use of financial contracts. The cost of this exchange is the interest paid by the borrower (see Financial cash flow cycles). The longer the time period, the higher the interest. The interest will always be paid in the future, by definition.</p>
    
    <p> The only possible cost in the present is a fee. A typical example is the simple interest loan where the lender lends the borrower a sum--the principal--in exchange for regular payments of interest until a day in the future when the borrower will pay the full principal back to the lender. Another example is the fully amortizing loan where the lender is paid back in constant payments comprising decreasing amounts of interest and increasing amounts of principal over the period of the loan. Typically a fee is also added to the payments.</p>

Financing is a useful business tool. A business is an organization that exists primarily to generate profit for its owners through the sale of goods or services to consumers and the employment of workers. Others would say that businesses exist primarily to keep folks busy--that is, to provide jobs.
Using financing, a business can leverage its operations by borrowing money to spend on investments to increase future revenues.</p>
