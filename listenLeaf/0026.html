    <p> The question of whether manipulation is right or wrong is one that should be answered individually.
That being said, there exist some technical differences between persuasion and manipulation. Manipulation often has a clear self-interest while persuasion may be undertaken for the greater good of an entire community.
Consider the case of an activist who persuades people to plant trees for the good of the environment.</p>
    
    <p> They may have to push and prod before they get the numbers to make the tree-planting exercise a success. Some people may view this as manipulation, but at the end of the day, the outcome of their efforts benefits the entire community.
Persuasion often presents a clear and coherent argument for a particular case, while manipulation will often involve a manipulation of facts intended to distort a person’s perception of reality. At the end of the day, persuasion and manipulation often serve the same goal, which is to convince something to do something that you want them to do.</p>
    
    <p> The key difference lies in how the parties choose to go about it: there is the all cards on the table method, which is persuasion and the hidden cards method of manipulation.
The Principles of Persuasion To master the art of persuasion, you must be aware of the underlying principles that will enable you to harness your power of influence. Human beings are a touchy lot; one wrong move, and you’ll lose all ability to convince people to get on your team. It is necessary that you make strategic moves that are informed by the necessary underlying principles.</p>
    
    <p> The six principles of persuasion are reciprocity, consistency, social proof, liking,
authority, and scarcity.
The Principle of Reciprocity Reciprocity is simply doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. As you go about your daily interactions, reciprocity calls for kindness and generosity. Showing kindness to others is a good thing that makes others, and yourself feel better about your interaction.</p>
    
    <p> Even more than that,
doing good is your way of collecting chips that you can cash in later. If you have been nice and kind to another person, you stand a better chance of them being nice and kind to you.
If you are hoping to be able to persuade a person, you must behave in a decent manner towards them. Speak a kind word, do them a favor or even buy them a gift.</p>
    
    <p> Later on, when you need to convince them to do something, they will be more agreeable. After all, you have proven yourself to be a kind human being who has their interest at heart.
The Principle of Consistency Consistency in persuasion works this way: people are more likely to commit to bigger tasks or favors if you have convinced them to agree to smaller ones. That is, you can get someone to swim oceans for you if you first get them to jump a puddle for you.</p>
    
    <p> There have been some studies conducted to support this theory. In one study, for instance, a group of researchers asked some homeowners to put up an ugly Drive Safely billboard on their front lawn. Very few homeowners said yes. The researchers then took another approach to the experiment: they first got the homeowners to agree to the small commitment of putting up a Drive Safely postcard in the front windows of their homes.</p>
    
    <p> Ten days later, they returned with the billboard request. This time round more homeowners agreed to put up the billboard despite its lack of aesthetic appeal. The reason for this is that the homeowners subconsciously felt compelled to remain consistent with their earlier response.
The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance technique that is premised on consistency.</p>
