    <p> “I taught at sitting desks for 30 years,” says Zink, “and I’ll never go back.” Tracy Smith, the principal at Vallecito during the switch to standing desks, agrees that students are “more focused, confident, and productive” when given license to move.
The community’s initial trepidation is telling. We associate stillness with steadiness, seriousness, and industriousness; we believe there’s something virtuous about controlling the impulse to move.</p>
    
    <p> At times and places where there’s work to be done, physical movement is regarded with disapproval, even suspicion. (Consider the way we associate fidgeting with a certain moral shiftiness.) What this attitude overlooks is that the capacity to regulate our attention and our behavior is a limited resource, and some of it is used up by suppressing the very natural urge to move.
This trade-off is highlighted by the work of Christine Langhanns and Hermann Müller of Justus Liebig University in Germany.</p>
    
    <p> For a study published in 2018, they asked groups of volunteers to solve a set of math problems in their heads while staying still, while remaining relaxed “but without substantial movement,” or while moving slightly in a rhythmic pattern. All the while, the participants’ cognitive load—how hard their brains were working—was being measured with a brain-scanning technology called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results were illuminating. Subjects’ cognitive load “considerably increased under the instruction ‘not to move,’ ” Langhanns and Müller report.</p>
    
    <p> Significantly, the stay-still command increased brain activity in the same area as did the mental calculations: the prefrontal cortex, responsible for carrying out intellectual tasks like arithmetic and for keeping our impulses in check. Of the three conditions, the requirement to remain still produced the poorest performance on the math problems; the greater their overall cognitive load as registered by fNIRS, the worse the subjects did on the calculations.
“Sitting quietly,” the researchers conclude, “is not necessarily the best condition for learning in school.” The continual small movements we make when standing as opposed to sitting —shifting our weight from one leg to another, allowing our arms to move more freely—constitute what researchers call “low-intensity” activity.</p>
    
    <p> As slight as these movements appear, they have a marked effect on our physiology: an experiment carried out by researchers at the Mayo Clinic determined that simply by standing rather than sitting, study participants expended 13 percent more energy. The impact on our cognitive functioning is also significant. Research has found that the use of a standing desk is associated with an enhancement in students’ executive function—that crucial capacity for planning and decision making—and with an increase in “on-task engagement.” In adults, working at a standing desk has been shown to boost productivity.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s not only that such activity-permissive setups relieve us of the duty to monitor and control our inclination to move; they also allow us to fine-tune our level of physiological arousal. Such variable stimulation may be especially important for young people with attention deficit disorders. The brains of kids with ADHD appear to be chronically under-aroused; in order to muster the mental resources needed to tackle a difficult assignment, they may tap their fingers, jiggle their legs, or bounce in their seats. They move as a means of increasing their arousal—not unlike the way adults down a cup of coffee in order feel more alert.</p>
    
    <p>
Julie Schweitzer, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California,
Davis, led a 2016 study of children aged ten to seventeen who had been diagnosed with ADHD. As the young participants worked on a challenging mental task, their movements were monitored by a sensor, called an actometer,
strapped to their ankles. She found that more intense physical movement was associated with better cognitive performance on the task. The more the children moved, in other words, the more effectively they were able to think.</p>
    
    <p> Parents and teachers often believe they have to get kids to stop moving around before they can focus and get down to work, Schweitzer notes; a more constructive approach would be to allow kids to move around so that they can focus.
Even among those without an ADHD diagnosis, the amount of stimulation required to maintain optimal alertness varies from person to person. Indeed, it may differ for the same individual over the course of a day. We have at our disposal a flexible and sensitive mechanism for making the necessary adjustments: fidgeting.</p>
