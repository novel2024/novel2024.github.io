Strategic principles The best way to understand the Renaissance man is through the use of an analogy--a university. Most universities research and teach a wide variety of subjects that are further split into courses taught by corresponding experts. In other words, the subjects are diversified. This means that if any one or even several subjects suddenly became obsolete, the university as a whole would still function.</p>
    
    <p> The experts are gathered into departments and institutes. Typically, experts within their respective departments are strongly connected (Physics-Physics). Usually, they will also connect somewhat more loosely in interdisciplinary studies with other departments in the institute (Physics-Astronomy), and sometimes they may go outside the institute and connect with experts at other institutes (Physics-History). For a university, each institute and each department functions almost independently of the other.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, a university is modularized, and through the collaborations that connect different kinds of expertise, new knowledge and complex solutions are created. Therefore, a university is consilient. Despite its complexity, a university isn't subject to catastrophic failure whenever a professor has to cancel a lecture due to illness or a meeting, or whenever students don't come back in time after spring break,
or when equipment doesn't show up on schedule or a laboratory gets flooded by a rainstorm. People (professors, students, and administrators) simply rearrange and reschedule without issue, because the entire system is built on a foundation of loosely coupled feedbacks.</p>
    
    <p> Hence, jarring one part of the system does not noticeably affect the other parts.
Compare this to the businessman, who in many respects is similar except that loose feedbacks, which in the business world are known as inefficiencies (because time is money), are now tightly coupled feedbacks.40 A business is like a nuclear power plant, which is a complex and tightly coupled system. Here many failsafes (over a dozen for some parts) are in place to keep the system operating within its tolerance limits.</p>
    
    <p> If one failsafe breaks, another picks up. Another example is the financial system. Rather than focusing on stable operation like in nuclear power plants, financial engineering was used to leverage to maximize profit using relatively tiny differences between the strong opposing forces of assets and liabilities--that is, in the most general sense, by borrowing large amounts of money at a low interest rate and lending/sending it back out at a slightly higher rate. This tight coupling led to cascading failures, where failing parts caused other parts to fail, and so on, until a buffer was created by the taxpayers with the government as a proxy.</p>
    
    <p> Any part that is so tightly coupled that it can't be saved in the time it takes to decouple, will fail.
The salary man is the simplest to understand, but not necessarily the simplest to live as. Real world examples of something that is simple but tightly coupled includes most technology, as "simple and tightly coupled" is almost the definition of technology or a tool. Examples of industry thus comprise Industrialism 1.</p>
    
    <p>0, with its heavy, centralized engines--that is,
dams, water supply and waste water treatment, many conveyer belt systems,
power looms, printing presses, and so on, down to most consumer technology. In short, these can all be stopped by throwing a switch, but their stoppage will not begin to affect other systems. The reader may note that those tool or cog-like qualities are actually ideal for a work force, though not for the individuals themselves, many of whom have little control over their work and are just one paycheck away from being unable to pay rent or put food on the table. This is generally not a very desirable position to be in,
so the aim for anyone in this category is to bring in more income by entrepreneuring complex systems as a businessman or by introducing slack,
like emergency funds.</p>
    
    <p> Despite its inherent problems of lacking resilience and consilience, salaried work is amazingly popular among employees. It is heavily promoted by employers, who keep calling for better tools (career professionals) to operate their ongoing concerns. Most books on personal finance or productivity focus on this area.
The working man can accommodate shocks and short-term failures (like job loss or car breakdown) without destabilizing.</p>
