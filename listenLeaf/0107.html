    <p> At the same time, reimagined theories and novel investigative methods have granted researchers new insight into how the group mind actually operates, placing the field on a genuinely scientific footing. Neither senseless nor supernatural, group thinking is a sophisticated human ability based on a few fundamental mechanisms. We’ll begin with this one: synchrony.
 EVERY MORNING AT 6:30, the program starts up with the jaunty plinking of a piano.</p>
    
    <p>
“Nobinobi to senobi no undoo kara!” announces the narrator of Radio Taiso,
a three-minute calisthenics routine broadcast daily in Japan for decades: “Stand tall and stretch your whole body!” On cue, millions of Japanese—gathered in office buildings, factories, construction sites, community centers, and public parks—begin working through a series of exercises they’ve known by heart since childhood.
“Ichi, ni, ushiro ni sorasete; tsugi wa ude, to ashi no undoo!”—“One, two,
and back down; stretch your back, next arms and legs!” Classmates, co-workers,
groups of young mothers and senior citizens reach, flex, twist, and hop in unison. “Now, forward bends, with rhythmic bounces! Bend three times, then hands on your hips, bend backwards.” Arms swinging, knees dipping, they move as if one body, right up to the program’s closing lines: “Fukaku iki o suimasuu,
yukkuri sutte yukkuri haite; go, roku, moo ikkai!”—“And we end with deep breaths, slowly in and slowly out; five, six, and one more time!” The benefits of this activity—practiced by everyone from the youngest schoolchildren to top executives at Sony and Toyota—may go well beyond fitness and flexibility for those who take part.</p>
    
    <p> A substantial body of research shows that behavioral synchrony—coordinating our actions, including our physical movements, so that they are like the actions of others—primes us for what we might call cognitive synchrony: multiple people thinking together efficiently and effectively.
A study by psychologists at the University of Washington, for example, asked pairs of four-year-old children to play on a swing set apparatus installed in their lab; the researchers then discreetly manipulated whether the kids swung in unison or out of sync. After getting down from the swings, the preschoolers who had swung in time with their partners were more likely to cooperate with those same partners on a subsequent set of tasks. Comparable results were found among eight-year-olds who experienced synchronized play on a computer game;
afterwards they reported feeling a greater sense of similarity and closeness to their partners than did participants who also played the game but did so out of sync with their peers.</p>
    
    <p> Studies conducted with adults show the same: moving in sync makes us better collaborators.
Why would this be? On the most basic level, synchrony sends a tangible signal to others that we are open to cooperation, as well as capable of cooperation. Synchronized movement acts as an invitation to work together,
along with an assurance that such work will be productive. In addition to this signaling function, synchrony appears to initiate a cascade of changes in the way we view ourselves and others.</p>
    
    <p> The recognition that we’re moving in the same way at the same time as other people heightens our awareness of being part of a group, leading us to focus less on ourselves as individuals. Because these others are making motions similar to our own, we’re able to interpret and predict their actions more easily. Research shows that we are more apt to “mentalize” about them, forming a notion of what’s going on in their heads. Synchrony even alters the nature of our perception, making our visual system more sensitive to the occurrence of movement.</p>
    
    <p> As a result of such changes, we form more accurate memories of people we have synchronized with, including the way they look, the moves they make, and the words they say. We learn from them more readily. We communicate with them more fluidly. And we pursue shared goals with them more effectively.</p>
    
    <p>
On an emotional level, synchrony has the effect of making others, even strangers, seem a bit like friends and family. We feel more warmly toward those with whom we have experienced synchrony; we’re more willing to help them out, and to make sacrifices on their behalf. We may experience a blurring of the boundaries between ourselves and others—but rather than feeling that our individual selves have shrunk, we feel personally enlarged and empowered, as if all the resources of the group are now at our disposal. Studies of athletes and dancers have even found that moving in unison increases endurance and reduces the perception of physical pain.</p>
    
    <p> Synchronization sweeps us up into what one researcher calls a “social eddy,” in which the press of our individual interests is diminished and the performance of the group becomes paramount. When we are carried along by the social eddy, cooperation with others feels smooth, almost effortless.
The popularity of synchronized exercises in Japan—a society famous for its communal spirit and internal cohesion—would appear to be firmly grounded in research and in the workings of human nature. In every culture and every era,
armies, churches, and other institutions have used synchronous movement to bond disparate individuals into a unified whole.</p>
