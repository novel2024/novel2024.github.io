    <p> Unfortunately, it's now normal to live in heated and air-conditioned bubbles which allow for no adaptation at all, except perhaps to the price of those services. Here's how to do it.
To adapt to heat, you need to increase the efficacy of your sweat glands.
This is best done by exercising or being physically active at high temperature, like outside without air conditioning.</p>
    
    <p> With increased heat, you won't need to eat to stay warm like you would in a colder environment, and thus you'll eat less. Eat lighter foods: more vegetables. This will save money and you'll also be eating in season. Change your schedule to do more physical work early in the morning and take a siesta during the warmest hours of the day.</p>
    
    <p> Sleep outside, or at least with open windows.
These changes are possible once you achieve control over your work schedule.
To adapt to cold, try switching to cold showers. Instead of standing under the showerhead, move it around the body, starting with the head and extremities.</p>
    
    <p> This will save on water and heat, and it will increase cold tolerance and circulation. It takes about two weeks to adapt. Any kind of "cheating" can be treated as a setback. One step forward, two steps back.</p>
    
    <p>
Another way to feel warmer (but actually be cooler) is to lose subcutaneous fat under the skin. This brings the surface of the skin closer to the heat-generating sources (muscles and organs) within the body. As a consequence, your skin will feel warmer to the touch. Since heat loss increases with surface to volume area (the rounder and larger the body, the less loss--children and long and slender adults will lose more)--this will require more heat to be generated and consequently you'll need to be more physically active and eat more.</p>
    
    <p>
Food increases metabolism. Warm food with a high heat capacity (large water content) such as soup comes with thermal energy (heat) as well. The body will naturally want to eat more when the environment is cold because the metabolism is naturally increased, and vice versa when it's warm. As a corollary, if you're on reduced calories, relative to the ambient temperature you'll feel colder.</p>
    
    <p> Not adjusting one's eating to the season (see Eating like a farmer) will lead to difficulties when trying to cope with warm weather without air conditioning or cold weather without heating.
An intensive exercise regime--that is, heavy weightlifting (see High intensity interval training) or similar--substantially increases the metabolism up to 24 hours afterwards. Low-intensity exercising, like running, cycling, dancing, yoga, etc.Â doesn't have a similar effect.</p>
    
    <p> Here, the body reverts to normal within an hour. One solution is to keep moving (also useful when outdoors, in which case if you're cold, move faster). Perform basic activities that require some human muscle power instead of sitting/standing still and pushing buttons. For example, use manual appliances.</p>
