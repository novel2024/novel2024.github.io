    <p> The work-spend-consume method is a very simple way of managing finances. There's only one source of income and it's impossible to spend money that hasn't been earned. All you need is a job and a bank account. If the employer pays in cash, you don't even need a bank account.</p>
    
    <p>
The cash flow of someone who works for a living.
Running the cycle produces waste as shown by the dashed arrow in this figure. While some think that more waste means more "living," it's clear that the more waste which leaves the stuff area without being consumed by you--for example, superfluous bedrooms, time spent commuting, clothes never worn, things collecting dust on the shelves--the faster the cycle must run and the harder or more you must work.
The cash flow of someone who works for a living and continuously replaces his stuff.</p>
    
    <p>
People, who are credit-worthy, which until recently meant practically anybody, as people didn't even need to be alive to be "pre-approved," can then use credit to increase their spending on stuff (seeÂ The salary man). This is shown in this figure. First there's an arrow going from debt to stuff, which is called financing. This can be car-financing, furniture-financing, or house- financing (mortgage).</p>
    
    <p> There's also an arrow going from wage into debt.
This represents the monthly payments which naturally are no longer going into stuff. There's also an arrow going from debt to other people, which represents the interest and finance charges and other ways lenders are getting paid for fronting the money you spend on stuff.
The cash flow when going into debt.</p>
    
    <p> Some of the wages are now diverted into paying off debt and paying interest to other people.
However, it's possible to buy more stuff than is otherwise affordable from the increased flow by using credit.
What sometimes happens is that this cycle spirals out of control. This can happen if there's no negative feedback, which is the case if credit limits are increased to no end or if minimum payments are held down to make the payback period extremely long.</p>
    
    <p> This is profitable to the lender as long as the borrower doesn't default. The result is shown in this figure. At this point all wages are going toward paying off debt. Stuff can only be bought through continued use of credit.</p>
    
    <p> This stage is right at the limit of defaulting,
because payments can barely be made. A job loss will push this person into default. The only option then would be to negotiate a lower interest rate that will lower the payment, and then spend the extra money paying off debt rather than spending it on more stuff.
The cash flow when fully in debt.</p>
    
    <p> All payments are going towards bills and credit service. Credit is used for all purchases.
Even when not liable for debt payments, the dependence on having to spend to get stuff, which can be thought of as another liability, means that losing the wage will cause serious hardship. To prevent this, wise people establish a so-called emergency fund.</p>
