    <p> In comparison, a 20 year fund with the same parameters lasts 37.39 years. This is highly interesting,
because by doubling the savings before beginning the withdrawal, an additional 15 years was gained on top of the 2.38 years from the 10 year fund's interest.</p>
    
    <p>
This equation is the key formula for extreme early retirement, so pay extra attention to this paragraph! The formula relates the number of retirement years (your life expectancy upon retiring) to the rate of return on your portfolio and the size of your portfolio given in either withdrawal rates p/P0 or the equivalent "years of fund" as illustrated by this table. Note that these two numbers are each other's exact inverse,108 since if P0 is given in years, then p=1 year.
This figure shows the equation, relating the size of the fund to how long it lasts for different values of i. First, note that i=0 produces a straight line because if no interest is received, an N year fund will last exactly N years.</p>
    
    <p>
Also, note that if i = (p/P0)/(1-p/P0) then the denominator is 0 and N -> infty. This means that the portfolio will last forever. The reason is that each year the portfolio grows exactly by the amount that is withdrawn. This is also called a perpetuity and it will preserve the principal forever.</p>
    
    <p> A quick rearrangement of i = (p/P0)/(1-p/P0) yields P0 = (1+i)p/i,
which is the required fund size to withdraw p at the beginning of each period when interest is added at the end of the period.109 A perpetuity leaves an estate which is exactly equal to P0. If less than p (as given by this equation) is withdrawn, then what is not withdrawn can be used to grow principal. This means that P will increase even as money is withdrawn.</p>
    
    <p>
Size of fund given in years of expenses versus how long it will actually last before being depleted given different investment return rates.
The time to accumulate the fund P0/p (given in years or months or whatever your preferred time unit is) can be calculated in a similar way. The simplest way to calculate it uses the method of this table P0/p=(r)/(1-r)M,
where r is the savings rate and M is the number of years worked. This is the same equation that was used to generate this table.</p>
    
    <p> Now, if the funds are invested at a rate i and allowed to compound we get P0/p=(r)/(1-r)SUMi=1 M (1+i)i-1.
Note that this equation reduces to the equation above if i=0. Using a similar trick to handle the sum, we find P0/p=(r)/(1-r)((1+i)M-1)/(i).
In traditional personal finance planning the time invested M is the most important factor, with typical values around 30 or 40 years.</p>
    
    <p> Some people will be clever enough to achieve superior investment returns i. We are not counting on this. In the case of early retirement, M will be small, and we will presume that i is of the usual range, maybe around 6%. The main lever in this equation is thus r/(1-r).</p>
    
    <p> For a traditional savings rate r=0.1 the lever is r/(1-r)=0.11, whereas for an extreme savings rate r=0.75, the lever r/(1- r)=3, which is 27 times higher! Even with a lot of time to compound and a market outperformance of a few percent, it's hard to beat a factor of 27.</p>
