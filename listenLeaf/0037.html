    <p> This chapter explores these myths and misconceptions while shedding some light on the same.
Myth #1: Psychopaths and sociopaths are one and the same thing Truth: Psychopathy and sociopathy are two different types of antisocial personality disorders The term psychopath and sociopath are used interchangeably in everyday conversation. However, the two traits are significantly different from each other. That being said, these two personality disorders do share some similarities.</p>
    
    <p> Experts consider sociopathy to be a less severe disorder than psychopathy. The table below shows some of the characteristics that distinguish a psychopath from a sociopath.
 Psychopath Sociopath Has no conscience Has a weak conscience Are able to blend in by being charming and are therefore harder to spot Have no intention of blending in and are often easy to spot. Will primarily be interested in themselves only Cold-hearted and calculating Hot-headed and leap without looking  Myth #2: Psychopaths are made and not born Truth: Psychopaths are born that way Psychopathy is a very complicated personality disorder in that psychopaths are more often born rather than made.</p>
    
    <p> A psychopath comes out the womb wired differently than most people. As a result, they deviate from the tangent of what is normal and often times find themselves in positions that any other ‘normal’ person would not necessarily find themselves in. Research undertaken has indeed shown that the brains of psychopath’s function differently when compared to the brains of other people who do not have any recorded personality disorders. So, what happens when a psychopath is born?
Depending on the type of environment the psychopath grows up in, the psychopath will become one of several things.</p>
    
    <p> If the young child who shows signs of psychopathy grows up in a nurturing environment, he will likely become a business or political leader of much influence. If the child grows up in a violent or traumatic environment, they are likely to become serial killers or murderers. Psychopaths who are nurtured in an environment that is somewhere in between the first two environments end up in positions of power in fields such as law enforcement and management.
Myth #3: Sociopaths are born Truth: Sociopaths are mainly a product of their environments More often than not, sociopaths are as a result of the environment that they are brought up in.</p>
    
    <p> It often starts with a biological or genetic disposition to sociopathy, which is then worsened by the type of nurturing that they get.
For instance, a child who grows up in an environment where nobody seems to care for him will probably carry the same lack of empathy in his adulthood. If they grew up with adults who had no sense of integrity and lacked a moral compass, their conscience would be highly impaired as a result.
Myth #4: Females cannot be psychopaths Truth: There are recorded cases of female psychopaths More likely than not, when you hear of the term psychopath, you automatically think of a male character.</p>
    
    <p> After all, Hollywood has done its best to portray psychopaths as ax-wielding males on a murder spree.
However, it is important to note that psychopaths can be female too. Unlike their male counterparts, however, female psychopaths are less likely to be physically aggressive or violent. Rather, they resort to using their sexuality and femininity to manipulate others.</p>
    
    <p> Female psychopaths are also likely to have a high number of sexual partners.
Myth #5: Psychopaths are obsessed with murder.
Truth: Psychopaths are thrill-seekers.
Murder is just one of the ways through which psychopaths quench their desire for the thrill.</p>
    
    <p> When most people think of psychopaths, they automatically thinking of murders left, right, and center. However, while it is true that a killer is more likely to be a psychopath than not, it is also true that psychopaths are not thinking of committing murder any more than the rest of the population. Many psychopaths go through their lives seeking thrills and never really causing anybody violent harm. Yes, they might break a few hearts as they jump from one sexual partner to the next and throw several people under the bus in an aim to climb the corporate ladder, but that’s as far as most of them go.</p>
