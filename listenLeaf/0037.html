    <p> In a study published in 2019, she and her colleagues reported that company founders who deployed “the skilled use of gesture” in their pitches were 12 percent more likely to attract funding for their new ventures. Such adept use of movement includes the presentation of “symbolic gestures”—movements that capture the overall meaning of the speaker’s message—along with what are called “beat gestures”: hand motions that serve to punctuate a particular point.
When Hercule repeatedly pointed to his eyes and then to the view before him, he was making a symbolic gesture (eyes on the road); when he formed his fingers into a pincer, or jabbed at the air with his fist, he was emphasizing his contentions with beat gestures. Skilled gesturers don’t leave this important element of their delivery to chance, Clarke notes; they practice the movements they intend to make just as they rehearse the words they plan to say.</p>

Adding persuasive force to a presentation is just one role gesture can play in shaping the thinking we do, as both gesture makers and gesture observers.
Research demonstrates that gesture can enhance our memory by reinforcing the spoken word with visual and motor cues. It can free up our mental resources by “offloading” information onto our hands. And it can help us understand and express abstract ideas—especially those, such as spatial or relational concepts,
that are inadequately expressed by words alone.</p>
    
    <p> Moving our hands helps our heads to think more intelligently, and yet gesture is often scorned as hapless “hand waving,” or disparaged as showy or gauche.
This is an attitude that Frederic Mishkin, an economist at Columbia Business School, knows well. Whether he’s standing in front of a lecture hall or engaged in a casual conversation, Mishkin’s hands are continually in motion, an emphatic complement to his speech. “I talk with my hands,” he says.</p>
    
    <p> “I always have.” Early in his career, however, one of his mentors became exasperated by his constant gesticulating. Seeking to break his protégé of the habit, he declared a rule for when Mishkin visited his office. “He made me sit on my hands as I talked with him,” Mishkin recalls ruefully.</p>

Such disdain for gesture is a cultural constraint at odds with the way humans naturally communicate. Indeed, linguists theorize that gesture was humankind’s earliest language, flourishing long before the first word was spoken. Even now,
gesture provides an alternate channel of communication every bit as significant as the verbal one. Gestures exert a powerful impact on how we understand and remember our interactions with others, but its influence operates largely below our awareness.</p>
    
    <p> We may choose our own words carefully, and listen closely to what others say, yet still fail to notice a substantial proportion of the communication that is actually occurring. A profusion of “extra-verbal meaning” is continually being offered and received.
At times, gesture works with language to more richly specify the speaker’s meaning—to clarify or emphasize what is being said. On other occasions,
gesture supplies meaning that is not found anywhere in the speaker’s words.</p>
    
    <p> And at still other moments, gesture asserts meaning that contradicts or departs entirely from the speaker’s verbal self-expression. Gesture conveys things we don’t say; as we’ll discover, gesture even conveys things we can’t say—because we don’t yet have the words.
All of us, then, are effectively bilingual: we speak one or more languages, but we are also fully fluent in gesture. Over the course of our species’s evolutionary history, gesture was not superseded or replaced by spoken language—rather, it maintained its place as talk’s ever present partner, one that is actually a step or two ahead of speech.</p>
    
    <p> Christian Heath, a professor of work and organization at King’s College London, uses the close analysis of videotaped conversations to examine the dynamic interplay between physical movement and verbal expression. One doctor-patient dialogue recorded by Heath demonstrates in fine- grained detail how people often gesture first and speak second.
In Heath’s video, the doctor on camera is saying of a particular class of medicines he is prescribing that “they help, sort of, you know, to dampen down inflammation”—but by the time he says “you know,” he has already completed three downstrokes of his hand. For her part, the patient makes reference to the stress of her financial troubles and how she goes “round and round in circles” trying to catch up with her bills—but before she utters these words, her hands have already started moving in a circular pattern.</p>
