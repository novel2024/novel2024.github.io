    <p> In this case, debt can be used to pay for more stuff and wages can be used to pay for debt, such as from credit cards, car loans, mortgages,
student loans, etc. This allows people to buy more than they can presently afford in exchange for less income in the future.
Few people pay cash anymore and "financial success" depends on being good at managing debt. As an ironic twist, like grade point averages in school, debt management skills are also evaluated in a single number called a credit score.</p>
    
    <p> It's not clear exactly how a credit score is computed, and therefore much time is spent trying to outguess the system. Personal finance, as opposed to business finance, operates on the concept of consumption smoothing also known as, "Fake it until you make it," as it allows consumers to buy products which they presently can't afford due to lack of savings, but will be able to afford by making payments over time.
Unlike a business, which invests the money in assets with a higher return,
allowing businesses to use debt as a leverage, consumers "invest" in higher consumption. The lack of return on assets to pay the interest means they must either work harder or longer for their consumption, and so they do.</p>

Add lifestyle inflation (see The pursuit of stuff, status, and happiness) and you have a process that inherently demands more and more work while quite possibly providing less and less contentment. This is the definition of a wage slave. Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they're not free to quit their job. Wage slaves are free to choose other products as long as they can afford it, but they're not capable of creating alternatives to buying products, because they're too busy working.</p>

The working man A working man is someone who doesn't collect a salary or other associated benefits. His income is uncertain, possibly because he takes on smaller projects that only last days, weeks, or perhaps months, and he knows and plans for this. It's likely he does some form of freelance consulting or works for multiple employers in short order, one at a time. A working man should therefore not have a tightly-coupled budget like the salary man, as job loss can result in homelessness or the inability to purchase products.</p>
    
    <p> Therefore, the working man often establishes an emergency fund (see Financial cash flow cycles) to introduce some slack into the system, which allows him to continue consuming during periods with less or no income. This fund covers the budget, at least temporarily, if the money flow is reduced or cut off. An alternative is to purchase unemployment insurance. A similar alternative is to use credit cards.</p>
    
    <p>
However, with sporadic income, credit will be more expensive for the working man compared to the salary man, who earns a steadier income.
The purpose of an emergency fund or unemployment insurance is to cover unexpected expenses or lack of income for the amount of time it takes to find another job. An industrial example of a loosely coupled linear system is a mining operation, where miners carry their own rebreathers.
Normally, a mine functions like an assembly line, but if one link fails,
which would be catastrophic if everybody was hooked up to the same line of oxygen, it doesn't impact the entire line catastrophically.</p>
    
    <p> Mining operations are loosely coupled for precisely this reason!
The principal financial difference between a salary man and a working man, as defined here, is the amount of fiscal coupling. The salary man has easy access to credit, and if he chooses to accept this burden, he must maintain a job to shoulder it. A working man will also often, but not always, have easy access to credit. This means, as mentioned above, that the working man must maintain a financial buffer to create slack in the system.</p>
    
    <p>20 The lack of easy credit also means fewer obligations. Working men are closer to a situation where they can decouple themselves from a particular job or career. In fact, working men tend to have a much easier time finding jobs than professional specialists. The latter must go to where the jobs are, which can often result in steep costs of living, whereas less specialized jobs can be found everywhere.</p>
