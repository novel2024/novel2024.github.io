TV, cell phones, and other money sinks As mentioned earlier (see How to get things), many products have been turned into service arrangements, where a company will provide the "hardware" for free or at a loss-leading price in return for a contract buy-in.
Such services--TV, phone connections, etc.--are mutually substitutable goods and it doesn't cost the company anything to keep you on the plan;
they just rake in the money. If the cables are already in place and all that travels on them is information, more information isn't going to cost much energy.</p>
    
    <p> Companies therefore spend large amounts of money trying to tell you how their service is different (see A comfortable addiction), because it actually is not. This means that once a customer has been hooked, the companies will try hard to keep him on, since the advertising costs are sunk.
Thus, if you ever want to deal with a service company, simply ask to speak with their retention department to negotiate a better deal.
Cell phones Opinions are strongly divided--I have my opinion, everybody else seems to have a different one--when it comes to cell phones.</p>
    
    <p> No less than a decade ago people did just fine without them, yet cell phones have already turned into a "need." Aside from providing an opportunity to share the most mundane details of one's life at all times, cell phones have created the opportunity to engage in activities without any prior planning whatsoever.
Cell phones have provided a false sense of security and the ability to disregard precautions, like bringing a map. If you're having trouble letting go, talk to an older person (over 25) about how they used to get around without them.</p>
    
    <p>
If you must have a cell phone, I suggest a pay-as-you-go plan. This should not cost more than $15/month. Don't get suckered into contracts.
The primary reason for having a cell phone isn't to call your friends and tell them you're on your way; it's to call 911 in case of an emergency.</p>
    
    <p> Cell phones have this capability without a contract! If you need to make a real phone call, say, to your bank, use a VoIP phone service. Don't rely on VoIP for emergencies; it's not sufficiently reliable.
Internet I have many good things to say about the Internet. To the Renaissance man, the Internet is like a super-advanced library/meeting place where it's easy to find like-minded people100 as well as instructions for doing and making most things yourself.</p>
    
    <p> It's also a great way to waste a lot of time.
These days, many websites--my own included--are full of advertising to pay for operating costs. However, it's also quite easy to avoid having to suffer the barrage of ads by using any one of the many adblocker plug-ins. In many cases, this will substantially speed up the load times of a site, which means that one can go with slower connections than otherwise believed.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, switching off all images tends to work really well on text-dominated sites like newspapers and blogs. Go ahead, I won't mind.
TV I have nothing good to say about TV. While I can't prove its universal disutility, I think not having a TV, or at least not watching it, is a big factor when it comes to choosing unconventional paths.</p>
    
    <p> Naturally, there's this popular idea that TV feeds the masses with certain values, but I believe this is exaggerated.101 Most programming offers fairly reticent opinions and is quite free of actual content. The great beauty of TV is therefore not so much that it acts as a form of active propaganda filling people with new ideas, but that it keeps people from having new ideas in the first place.
When TV was invented, it was thought to be a great opportunity, a great teaching tool for quickly reaching the masses.</p>
