    <p> For each year there will be a range of prices reflecting the different conditions. If the curve is trending downwards, the fixer-upper strategy is to buy something in poor condition,
fix it up and sell it later. This will make the holding cost zero. This way you can own expensive items, like boats or cars, for almost no cost.</p>
    
    <p>
In terms of financial considerations, the money which is now sitting in an asset that is unproductive has opportunity costs. If your rate of return is 6%, a $50,000 boat would cost you $3,000 annually, which you could have made had the money been invested. On the other hand, perhaps you were holding cash at 0.5%.</p>
    
    <p> In this case, your cost is only $250. If you offer the boat for chartering, you may even make money.
Shelter Many houses increasingly serve not only as living quarters but also as storage areas for toy collections, personal libraries, galleries of art and other assorted knick-knacks, small supermarkets (massive refrigerators), home cinemas, and restaurant-sized kitchens which seem proportional in size to the time the owners spend away from them, eating out. Outsource the storage and live in something smaller.</p>
    
    <p>
Additionally, there's a preference for suburban housing that leaves people far away from their jobs, unable to get anywhere without owning a car. Getting a driver's license and a car at 16 is a rite of passage into the "freedom" of adulthood. Without access to public transportation, which makes little sense when everything is spread out, it's difficult to get around without a car. Consequently, people growing up in these places often don't know how to ride a bike.</p>
    
    <p> Many can't even walk greater distances than a driveway, lacking the stamina, the proper clothing, and perhaps even the faith that they can engage in the vigorous labor of walking three miles without consulting a physician first.
Houses are surrounded by asphalt, unproductive vegetation, and artificial "lakes" which cover valuable agricultural soil. The unproductive vegetation is specifically selected to be unproductive to avoid having to pick up fruit from the ground. Why get free fruit from the garden when you can pay for it at the supermarket 5-10 miles away? In addition, the vegetation is often nonnative, which requires significant amounts of intervention.</p>
    
    <p>67 Consider, for example, how lawns are first fertilized and watered, then once they grow accordingly, they are cut down.
The houses are poorly built, but made to look expensive with fake brick walls and concrete columns. The optimal design for an efficient house is almost always rectangular with as few corners as possible, as corners are structurally weak and admit cold. Speaking of cold, housing is typically poorly insulated, if at all.</p>
    
    <p> This is a viable strategy in a world of cheap energy--a world that may not last much longer--with its central heating and cooling. With cold (warm) walls, the air temperature has to be raised above (lowered below) normal to compensate for the radiative heat loss (gain) from the walls. As a consequence, as money spent on insulation has gone down, room temperature in the winter (summer) has gone up (down), and the cost of living has gone up.
The problem is that there's a cultural perception of what constitutes a "good house," and despite or perhaps due to all the failures mentioned above, the suburban house with a lawn, a picket fence, and a car or three (one for each person over legal driving age) parked in the driveway is the pinnacle to attain.</p>
    
    <p> Like a peacock's tail, and in general for status symbols,
the more nonproductive and inefficient they are, the better status symbols they make. After all, if someone can afford to use a lot of resources in non- or even counterproductive ways, he must be rich, powerful, strong, etc. As the suburban house is able to absorb tremendous amounts of money, it makes an excellent status symbol.
Considering that the median home is priced above $150,000, a mortgage rate of 5% will cost the homeowner $9,663 each year, which is more than the entire budget of the lifestyle described in this chapter.</p>
