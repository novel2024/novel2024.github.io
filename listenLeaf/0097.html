    <p> When explaining academic content, the tutor is forced to make explicit the details she might herself have glossed over; the gaps in her own knowledge and understanding become visible. When directing the tutee to the most important aspects of the subject, and drawing connections among these features, the tutor is herself led to engage in a deeper level of mental processing. When fielding the pupil’s questions, and posing questions of her own, the tutor is obliged to adopt a “metacognitive” stance toward the material, consciously monitoring what her pupil knows and what she herself knows. Researchers have found that while students often possess the mental tools required to understand challenging academic content, they simply don’t apply them when studying on their own.</p>
    
    <p>
When placed in the role of teacher, however, students are compelled to put those tools to use, with previously unrealized benefits for their own learning.
So powerful is the teacher role, in fact, that some of its cognitive effects can be evoked even when one’s “students” don’t exist. Vincent Hoogerheide, an assistant professor of education at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, has conducted several studies in which participants are asked to explain academic content on camera, to an imagined audience. After studying the material themselves, participants create a short video lesson (on the calculation of probability, for example, or on syllogistic reasoning, among other subjects).</p>
    
    <p> No tutee is in attendance, and there is no tutor-tutee interaction—and yet,
Hoogerheide has found, the act of teaching on video enhances the teacher’s own learning, improves her test performance, and enhances her ability to “transfer” the learned information to new situations. Writing out an explanation of the same material for an imagined tutee does not generate the same gains.
Hoogerheide theorizes that teaching on camera generates persuasive feelings of “social presence”—the sense that there is someone watching and listening.
Explaining oneself while being recorded, he notes, measurably increases the explainers’ physiological arousal—a state that is associated with enhanced memory, attention, and alertness.</p>
    
    <p>
Face-to-face interaction between teacher and student remains the ideal,
however, and it produces benefits that go beyond academics. The act of teaching can positively affect students’ identity and self-image, as demonstrated by a number of real-world peer-tutoring programs—for example, a nonprofit initiative called the Valued Youth Partnership. Though we might imagine that tutors should be drawn from the ranks of the most accomplished students,
Valued Youth does just the opposite: it deliberately recruits struggling students and assigns them to teach younger kids. Evaluations of the program show that students who engage in tutoring earn higher grades, attend school more consistently, and stay enrolled at higher rates than similar students who do not participate.</p>
    
    <p> Such outcomes may be due, in part, to the experience of what psychologists call “productive agency”: the sense that one’s own actions are affecting another person in a beneficial way. Actually seeing the fruits of one’s labor is especially gratifying; research finds that tutors learn more, and derive more motivation, from a tutoring session when they have the opportunity to watch their tutees answer questions about what they’ve learned.
The experience of teaching others can also help tutors become more fully integrated into an academic or professional community. The Summer Premed Program, operated out of the medical school at the University of California,
Irvine, enlists African American and Latino medical students to teach college students who are themselves members of minority groups.</p>
    
    <p> The undergraduates,
in turn, teach students from Irvine’s predominantly black and Latino public high schools. Started in 2010, the program has been shown to enhance the self- confidence and motivation of all three tiers of students.
This “cascading mentorship” model, in which participants both teach and are taught, shows promise in many settings, including the workplace. Just as students benefit from teaching their classmates, professionals gain from advising their colleagues.</p>
    
    <p> Holly Chiu, an associate professor of business management at Brooklyn College, reported in a study published in 2018 that employees who engage in sharing job-related knowledge with their co-workers enlarge their own expertise in the bargain. By “systematically going through the knowledge,
examining it, understanding it, integrating it and presenting it,” Chiu notes, these workers increased the depth and breadth of their knowledge, and subsequently turned in job performances that were rated more highly by their supervisors.
Far from being frivolous or unserious, social interaction is a vital complement to intellectual activity, activating aptitudes and capabilities that might otherwise remain unused. But because the brainbound approach to cognition regards information as information, no matter how it is encountered, the social element of thinking is often sacrificed in the name of efficiency and convenience.</p>
    
    <p> The spread of technology into education and the workplace has reinforced this tendency, as students are asked to learn mathematical operations from Khan Academy videos and employees are expected to train themselves using online resources. But technology could be used in another fashion: to promote the kind of in-person social exchanges that do so much to extend our mental capacities.
For example: Family Playlists, a tool developed by the education nonprofit PowerMyLearning. After being introduced to a concept at school, students are directed to take their new knowledge home and teach it to their parents or other relatives or caregivers.</p>
