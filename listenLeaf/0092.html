Wieman is working to achieve wider recognition of an often overlooked truth:
the development of intelligent thinking is fundamentally a social process. We can engage in thinking on our own, of course, and at times solitary cognition is what’s called for by a particular problem or project. Even then, solo thinking is rooted in our lifelong experience of social interaction; linguists and cognitive scientists theorize that the constant patter we carry on in our heads is a kind of internalized conversation. Our brains evolved to think with people: to teach them, to argue with them, to exchange stories with them.</p>
    
    <p> Human thought is exquisitely sensitive to context, and one of the most powerful contexts of all is the presence of other people. As a consequence, when we think socially, we think differently—and often better—than when we think non-socially.
To offer just one example: the brain stores social information differently than it stores information that is non-social. Social memories are encoded in a distinct region of the brain.</p>
    
    <p> What’s more, we remember social information more accurately, a phenomenon that psychologists call the “social encoding advantage.” If findings like this feel unexpected, that’s because our culture largely excludes social interaction from the realm of the intellect. Social exchanges with others might be enjoyable or entertaining, this attitude holds, but they’re no more than a diversion, what we do around the edges of school or work. Serious thinking, real thinking, is done on one’s own, sequestered from others.</p>
    
    <p>
Science has not infrequently served to reinforce this notion. All of us have seen the images generated by fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging:
the gray mass of the brain, enlivened with patches of color denoting regions that are actively engaged in thought. The way technologies like fMRI are applied is a product of our brainbound orientation; it has not seemed odd or unusual to examine the individual brain on its own, unconnected to others. And the ubiquitous depictions generated by fMRI in turn perpetuate that very orientation:
the scans offer a vivid visual affirmation of the assumption that everything worth observing happens within the bounds of a single skull.</p>
    
    <p> Scientists who might have wished to investigate the role of social interaction on cognition have until recently been hampered by technical constraints; for many years following the introduction of fMRI, researchers were all but required to examine the individual in seclusion, shut inside the solitary bore of the MRI machine. Thus the neuroscientific study of how people think has been, for decades, the study of people thinking alone.
Now that is changing, as a growing interest in the social dimension of cognition has arrived alongside a new generation of more flexible and adaptable tools. Technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near- infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are allowing scientists to scan multiple people’s brains as they interact in naturalistic settings—making deals, playing games, or simply talking to one another.</p>
    
    <p> Using these tools, researchers have found persuasive evidence for what is known as the “interactive brain hypothesis”: the premise that when people interact socially, their brains engage different neural and cognitive processes than when those same people are thinking or acting on their own.
A representative example of this research emerges out of the study of how the brain comprehends and produces language. As far back as the nineteenth century, two bundles of gray matter—Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area—have been regarded as the brain’s “canonical” language regions. They are named after Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke, scientists who discovered the regions’ language- related function through their studies of brain-damaged patients (including autopsies of the patients following their deaths).</p>
    
    <p> Confirming the scientists’ hunches a century after they were advanced, Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area were the very regions that lit up in fMRI scans of study participants who were asked to read or listen to words. But the long-established canon elaborating the brain’s functional anatomy is now being revised by a new wave of research,
carried out with a new array of tools.
In experiments that track brain activity while subjects are not reading or passively listening but actually talking to other people, a third and heretofore unknown language-related neural circuit has been identified. Studies using fNIRS—a brain-scanning technology that works via a flexible band encircling the head—demonstrate that this newly recognized network, called the subcentral area, is specialized for predicting and responding to language as it is used moment by moment in conversation.</p>
    
    <p> This discovery adds to accumulating evidence showing that engaging in real-time conversation involves much more nimble and nuanced cognitive processes than does the simple recognition of discrete words. It requires us to anticipate the language our conversational partner will use in speaking to us, and to improvise the language we ourselves will muster in response.
A related finding emerged when scientists, again employing fNIRS, compared the brain scans of people playing poker with a human partner to those of people playing the same game with a computer. The areas of the brain involved in generating a “theory of mind”—inferring the mental state of another individual —were active in competing with a human but dormant in matching wits with a machine.</p>
