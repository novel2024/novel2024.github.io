    <p> Leasing is another example. However, a more nefarious strategy has been to build products of an increasingly inferior quality and, in doing so, make them cheaper. This creates a continuous and dependable demand as things break and are thrown out and replaced. It has therefore become somewhat of a challenge to "find the good stuff.</p>
    
    <p>" Finding the good stuff can be done by exploiting survivor bias. As someone informed me, the good stuff is whatever costs more than $100 in a pawn shop or an antique store.
Free things In general, people who live a life of abundance, like "primitive" tribesmen (see Human capital and necessary personal assets) or Californians, will be happy to give things away, the latter primarily to create more space in their garages, and the former presumably because they can easily build replacements. Dumpster diving is one method of acquiring free things, but with the Internet, the dumpster part is skipped.</p>
    
    <p> Post wanted or offered ads on mailing lists, newsgroups, or in classifieds, and people respond and come to pick it up. This saves the trouble of putting stuff in a dumpster and people from having to dive in to get it; it also saves stuff from the landfill. The range of stuff changing hands can be surprising: from leaves for composting to projector TVs. Supply and demand also fluctuates.</p>

What may be impossible to give away one month may be in high demand the next month. What may be impossible to give away in one place-- entertainment centers in California--may be picked up in another within the hour; possibly to be used as firewood. Speaking of firewood, people are happy to give away rounds in the summer when they're clearing away old trees to increase the size of their lawns. Get a splitting maul and dry them for firewood in the winter.</p>
    
    <p> All it requires is a little planning and your heating is free.
For lower-cost items which are not worth driving for, get rid of them by establishing a "table." Put things on the table and mark them "FREE." Lo and behold, people will quickly pick up on the idea, take your items away,
and put other items down.</p>
    
    <p> This works for magazines, garden harvest,
cookies, etc.Â  and is nicely established near the coffee machine, laundry facility, stairway, or other points where people gather or pass.
Swapping and bartering Another way of getting use-value without paying money is by swapping. There are several options for online swapping, which gives one access to a much larger market.</p>
    
    <p> Some swapping works on a credit-based system--rather than being paid money, giving away a book gets you a credit. Credits work like gift certificates as they can be used to order books from other people. This avoids the friction of having to find a specific trading counterpart. Usually these services are offered for free, which also avoids the friction caused by commissions.</p>
    
    <p>
Another solution is to trade directly. This comes with most of the problems of trade before the invention of money. Here one has to find another person and do the swap directly. One solution is three-way swaps:
A gives to B, B gives to C, and C gives to A.</p>
