    <p> The material things we arrange around us help us maintain that sturdy self-conception. As the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has written, we keep certain objects in view because “they tell us things about ourselves that we need to hear in order to keep our selves from falling apart.” Moreover, we need to have close at hand those prompts that highlight particular facets of our identity. Each of us has not one identity but many — worker, student, spouse, parent, friend—and different environmental cues evoke different identities.</p>
    
    <p> Daphna Oyserman, a psychologist at the University of Southern California, notes that signals from the environment function to bring one of these many personas to the fore, with real effects on our thought and behavior. “Which identity is salient in the moment influences both what one pays attention to and what one chooses to do,” she writes. One particularly striking example: research has found that cues that remind Asian American girls of their ethnicity improve their performance on math tests, while cues that remind them of their gender undermine their performance. For all of us, the objects on which our eyes come to rest each day reinforce what we’re doing in that place, in that role.</p>
    
    <p>
Through the ups and downs of our lives at school and at work, the reassuring stability of meaningful material objects can also help us manage our moods and emotions. When we engage in such “environmental self-regulation,” we rely on cues outside ourselves to maintain the kind of equilibrium inside ourselves that facilitates the pursuit of our goals. In a study of mid-level professionals, Gregory Laurence, a professor of management at the University of Michigan–Flint, found that incorporating personal items into their workspaces helped them relieve the “emotional exhaustion” brought on by a stressful job. Especially for employees whose office settings did not afford much privacy, being able to personalize their work area—with photographs, posters, comic strips, mugs—helped them “carve out their own space, inscribe it with personal meaning, and thus create a kind of sanctuary at work,” write Laurence and his coauthors.</p>
    
    <p>
Laurence is not the only researcher to detect an almost spiritual cast to the way people regard their personal space. In an ethnographic study of research and development professionals in the US headquarters of the Japanese technology company Hitachi, authors Ryoko Imai and Masahide Ban note that the employees they studied did “intensive reading, writing, and most importantly,
thinking in the comfort and solitude of [their] own cubicles . . .</p>
    
    <p> Often stocked with personal comfort items, familiar references, [and] favorite tools, a dedicated private space served as a sacred space to rejuvenate and regroup.” It’s possible to see shades of the monastery and the studiolo in these modern-day workstations and cubicles—evidence of the persistent human need to imbue our spaces with meaning and significance.
Yet many organizations discourage or even ban the display of personal items in employees’ workspaces. Such “clutter” may be frowned upon as an irrelevant distraction from the work at hand, or as an obstacle to achieving the clean, spare aesthetic associated with admired leaders like the late Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs.</p>
    
    <p> For psychologists Craig Knight and Alexander Haslam, such dictates bring a different figure to mind: Frederick Winslow Taylor, the early-twentieth- century engineer who introduced “scientific management” to American corporations. Taylor specifically prohibited workers from bringing their personal effects into the factories he redesigned for maximum speed and minimum waste.
Stripped of their individuality, he insisted, employees would function as perfectly efficient cogs in the industrial machine.
Knight and Haslam, who conducted the study of “lean” versus “enriched” and “empowered” versus “disempowered” working environments described earlier,
believe that an embrace of neo-Taylorism is a mistake, especially in an era when employees are expected to behave not as generic cogs but as critical and creative thinkers.</p>
    
    <p> As their own research has demonstrated, people are less productive in a lean, featureless office. “Making people feel they are in the wrong place, that it isn’t their place, is a very powerful way of undermining performance,” says Haslam. Although managers and administrators may fear that the presence of personal tokens will reduce organizational cohesion and loyalty, research evidence suggests that just the opposite is the case: employees feel more committed to their company when they are able to see themselves reflected in it.
A sense of ownership extends from the individual to the organization, and it flows through physical space.</p>
    
    <p>
 THE WAY SPACE is arranged can recognize our individuality, with positive effects on our motivation and performance. It can also affirm—or deny—our sense of belonging within an organization. Members of groups that have historically been excluded, marginalized, or negatively stereotyped are especially attuned to the signals of belonging or non-belonging they encounter in the environments they enter. Such signals are pervasive and powerful, though they are rarely the focus of discussions about bias.</p>
