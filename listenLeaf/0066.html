    <p> This goal has two positive (POS) and one negative first-order side effect (NEG). The first positive side effect has a positive second-order side effect (POS-POS). The second positive side effect has one positive second-order side effect (POS- POS) and two negative second-order side effects (POS-NEG). The first negative side effect has two positive second-order side effects (NEG- POS).</p>
    
    <p>
Let us consider a few examples.
[Hobby] The zeroth-order goal is to have fun. The first-order negative side effect is that it costs money. Another first-order negative effect is that it may require space.</p>
    
    <p> This space requirement has a second-order negative side effect in that this too requires money. A first-order positive effect may be meeting new people. A second-order positive effect of that is that this could allow for professional networking. A third-order positive effect is that this could lead to a job.</p>
    
    <p>
[Side business] The zeroth-order goal is to learn how to run a business.
Startup costs are a first-order negative effect. Income is a first-order positive effect; for many, income might be the zeroth-order goal.
Running a business has a time cost which may be positive or negative.</p>
    
    <p>
Regardless, a positive second-order effect of this is that this time is not spent spending money.
[Job] The zeroth-order goal is to earn money. Developing a career is a first-order positive side effect. Being stressed or unhealthy is a first- order negative side effect, as is the cost of business attire and keeping up appearances.</p>
    
    <p> A second-order negative effect of this is spending money to make up for this, either by taking drugs or shopping.
These are just examples. For instance, the zeroth-order goal of the job may be to develop a career rather than earning. In that case, put career as the zeroth-order goal and the money as a side effect.</p>
    
    <p> If clothing is supplied,
this is a positive side effect rather than a negative side effect.
Now, think of your own reverse fish bones in terms of how you spend most of your time and energy. This may also include family, education,
sports, religion, retirement, etc., and things you're not currently doing but could be doing.</p>
    
    <p>
Consider the sum total of all the effects of your actions. Since adopting specific actions will lead to specific outcomes, all effects can be considered goals, whether you actually want to achieve them or not. You may find some of these goals to be counterproductive. Some goals involve saving money, while others involve spending money.</p>
