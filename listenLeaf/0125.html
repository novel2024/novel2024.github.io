    <p> If you calculate 12 years until retirement, then you're really looking at 18, or six more years.
Giving up the car makes sense. First you'll save money on exercise.
Driving your car over to a gym to run on a treadmill, then driving back again is inefficient at best.</p>
    
    <p> If walked or biked to and from work, not only would you save the money otherwise spent on a car, you'd also save the money normally spent on a gym membership. Many people past college age completely ignore physical fitness. It seems like a degree and a career also serve as a subscription to physical decline. If you're going to retire early, it will be sad to sit on the couch all day, being shut out of physical activities due to a belief that weakness comes from age.</p>
    
    <p>
I'd consider it normal to--without preparation or prior training other than a daily commute--be able to run five miles, walk 25 miles, or bike 50 miles.
Perhaps these numbers sound insane. This suggests a large chasm between the frame of mind of someone who gets around using gasoline, and a walker, runner, or rider who gets around under his own power.
Walkers easily travel three miles by foot.</p>
    
    <p> Drivers get in their cars to get from one side of the parking lot to the other. Neither quite understand why the other is so crazy, when it's so easy to do things their way.
Not having access to an automobile means rediscovering the art of planning. Do your shopping in fewer trips, or alternatively plan to live closer to the market.</p>
    
    <p> I used to shop every other day on the way home from work, which meant I could buy food with fewer preservatives and chemical additives. Interestingly enough, it seems that as long as you know someone who is going the same way, they are usually happy to offer you a ride. Don't forget to extend favors in the other direction, like offering to pay for gas.
"But what about the children? Surely they need to be ferried around.</p>
    
    <p>" They need to live close enough to their school that they can ride a bike or walk or take the bus (consider this in How to find shelter). Good habits are best started early. Consider a trailer bike. Consider walking them to school,
or at least to the bus.</p>
    
    <p> When I was a kid I lived two miles from my school,
and my mom walked me back and forth for the first year. When you're free from your job, you'll have time for this--it's a meaningful thing to do. It's, in my opinion, better than working for more years so you can drive your kids back and forth in a van.
Affordable driving An enviable alternative is fixing up classic cars or motorcycles, which can make costs close to zero.</p>
    
    <p> This is done by buying a fixer-upper at the lower end of the price range of the depreciation curve for a given year,
fixing it up, and selling it at the upper end a few years later, making the holding cost close to zero, or perhaps even positive. This way you can achieve transportation as well as income, whereas cycling and walking achieve transportation and health. Of course, you could do the smart thing and fix up bicycles. It doesn't pay as well as auto repair, but you get transportation, money, and health (see A web of goals).</p>
