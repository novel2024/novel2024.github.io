    <p>” (The time she threw up all over her computer keyboard, after months of sixteen-hour days at work on her PhD dissertation, was one hint.) Seeking a different approach, Stanley found her way to mindfulness meditation, which she practices daily; she also created a program, called Mindfulness-based Mind Fitness Training, designed to bolster the cognitive resilience of service members facing high-stress situations. MMFT, as it is known, places an emphasis on recognizing and regulating the body’s internal signals. In collaboration with academic psychologists and neuroscientists,
Stanley has tested the efficacy of the program among troops as they prepare to deploy to combat; results show that the training helps participants maintain their attentional focus and preserve their working memory even under the most challenging circumstances.</p>
    
    <p> In workshops around the country, Stanley teaches the method not only to members of the military but also to others in high-stress occupations: firefighters, police officers, social workers, health care providers,
disaster relief workers.
Like the expert traders interviewed by Mark Fenton-O’Creevy, and like the elite athletes studied by Martin Paulus, Stanley has found that the most cognitively resilient soldiers pay close attention to their bodily sensations at the early stage of a challenge, when signs of stress are just beginning to accumulate.
She instructs her workshop participants to do the same, using mindfulness techniques similar to the ones described by Jon Kabat-Zinn. By remaining alert to these preliminary signals, she says, we can avoid being taken by surprise and then overreacting, entering a state of physiological arousal from which it is hard to come down.</p>
    
    <p> (Stanley notes ruefully that many of us take just the opposite approach, as she once did: pushing aside internal red flags in the hope that we can “power through” and get the job done.) Stanley also demonstrates for her students a technique she calls “shuttling”— moving one’s focus back and forth between what is transpiring internally and what is going on outside the body. Such shifts are useful in ensuring that we are neither too caught up in external events nor too overwhelmed by our internal feelings, but instead occupy a place of balance that incorporates input from both realms. This alternation of attention can be practiced at relaxed moments until it becomes second nature: a continuously repeated act of checking in that provides a periodic infusion of interoceptive information.</p>
    
    <p> The point is to keep in close contact with our internal reality at all times—to train ourselves “to pay attention and notice what’s happening while it’s happening,” as Stanley puts it. The vision of resilience she offers is not a formidable display of will and grit of the kind she once would have embraced; it is, rather, a flexible, moment-by-moment responsiveness to changing conditions—both inside and out.
 AN AWARENESS OF our interoceptive signals can assist us in making sounder decisions and in rebounding more readily from stressful situations. It can also allow us to enjoy a richer and more satisfying emotional life.</p>
    
    <p> Research finds that people who are more interoceptively attuned feel their emotions more intensely,
while also managing their emotions more adeptly. This is so because interoceptive sensations form the building blocks of even our most subtle and nuanced emotions: affection, admiration, gratitude; sorrow, longing, regret;
irritation, envy, resentment. People who are more interoceptively aware can interact more intimately and more skillfully with the emotions that interoceptive sensations help construct.
But first—understanding the relationship between interoception and emotion requires correcting a basic misconception most of us hold about how feelings come about.</p>
    
    <p> The story we’re used to telling goes like this: on the basis of what’s happening to us, the brain determines the appropriate emotion (happy, sad,
scared), then directs the body to act accordingly (smile, cry, scream). In fact, the causal arrow points in the opposite direction. The body produces sensations, the body initiates actions—and only then does the mind assemble these pieces of evidence into the entity we call an emotion.
The pioneering American psychologist William James deduced this more than a century ago.</p>
    
    <p> Imagine you meet a bear in the woods, James wrote. Your heart pounds, your palms sweat, your legs break into a run—why? It might seem that it’s because your brain generates a feeling of fear, and then tells your body to get moving. But James suggested that it works the other way around: we feel fear because our heart is racing, because our palms are sweating, because our legs are propelling us forward. As he put it: “Common sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, are angry and strike.</p>
    
    <p>” But, he went on, “this order of sequence is incorrect.” It would be more accurate, wrote James, to say that “we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble.” In recent years, scientists have begun to elaborate on James’s theory with the help of modern investigative techniques like brain scanning. Their research has confirmed that the thing we call “emotion” (and experience as a unified whole) is actually constructed from more elemental parts; these parts include the signals generated by the body’s interoceptive system, as well as the beliefs of our families and cultures regarding how these signals are to be interpreted.</p>
    
    <p> This perspective carries two important implications. First: the greater our awareness of interoceptive sensations, the richer and more intense our experience of emotion can be. And second: equipped with interoceptive awareness, we can get in on the ground floor of emotion construction; we can participate in creating the type of emotion we experience.
Psychologists who study the construction of emotion call this practice “cognitive reappraisal.</p>
    
    <p>” It involves sensing and labeling an interoceptive sensation, as we’ve learned to do here, and then “reappraising” it—reinterpreting it in an adaptive way. We can, for example, reappraise “nervousness” as “excitement.” Consider the interoceptive sensations that accompany these two emotions: a racing heart, sweaty palms, a fluttering stomach. The feelings are almost identical; it’s the meaning we assign to them that makes them, variously,
an ordeal to be dreaded or a thrill to be enjoyed.</p>
