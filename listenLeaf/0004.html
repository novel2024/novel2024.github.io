Introduction:
Thinking Outside the Brain U SE YOUR HEAD.
How many times have you heard that phrase? Perhaps you’ve even urged it on someone else—a son or daughter, a student, an employee. Maybe you’ve muttered it under your breath while struggling with an especially tricky problem,
or when counseling yourself to remain rational: Use your head!
The command is a common one, issued in schools, in the workplace, amid the trials of everyday life. Its refrain finds an echo in culture both high and low,
from Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker, chin resting thoughtfully on fist, to the bulbous cartoon depiction of the brain that festoons all manner of products and websites—educational toys, nutritional supplements, cognitive fitness exercises.</p>
    
    <p>
When we say it, we mean: call on the more than ample powers of your brain,
draw on the magnificent lump of tissue inside your skull. We place a lot of faith in that lump; whatever the problem, we believe, the brain can solve it.
But what if our faith is misplaced? What if the directive to “use your head,” ubiquitous though it may be, is misguided? A burgeoning body of research suggests that we’ve got it exactly backwards. As it is, we use our brains entirely too much—to the detriment of our ability to think intelligently.</p>
    
    <p> What we need to do is think outside the brain.
Thinking outside the brain means skillfully engaging entities external to our heads—the feelings and movements of our bodies, the physical spaces in which we learn and work, and the minds of the other people around us—drawing them into our own mental processes. By reaching beyond the brain to recruit these “extra-neural” resources, we are able to focus more intently, comprehend more deeply, and create more imaginatively—to entertain ideas that would be literally unthinkable by the brain alone. It’s true that we’re more accustomed to thinking about our bodies, our spaces, and our relationships.</p>
    
    <p> But we can also think with and through them—by using the movements of our hands to understand and express abstract concepts, for example, or by arranging our workspace in ways that promote idea generation, or by engaging in social practices like teaching and storytelling that lead to deeper understanding and more accurate memory. Rather than exhorting ourselves and others to use our heads, we should be applying extra-neural resources to the project of thinking outside the skull’s narrow circumference.
But wait, you may be asking: What’s the need? Isn’t the brain, on its own, up to the job? Actually, no. We’ve been led to believe that the human brain is an all-purpose, all-powerful thinking machine.</p>
    
    <p> We’re deluged with reports of discoveries about the brain’s astounding abilities, its lightning quickness and its protean plasticity; we’re told that the brain is a fathomless wonder, “the most complex structure in the universe.” But when we clear away the hype, we confront the fact that the brain’s capacities are actually quite constrained and specific. The less heralded scientific story of the past several decades has been researchers’ growing awareness of the brain’s limits. The human brain is limited in its ability to pay attention, limited in its capacity to remember, limited in its facility with abstract concepts, and limited in its power to persist at a challenging task.</p>
    
    <p>
Importantly, these limits apply to everyone’s brain. It’s not a matter of individual differences in intelligence; it’s a matter of the character of the organ we all possess, its biological nature and its evolutionary history. The brain does do a few things exquisitely well—things like sensing and moving the body,
navigating through space, and connecting with other humans. These activities it can manage fluently, almost effortlessly.</p>
    
    <p> But accurately recalling complex information? Engaging in rigorous logical reasoning? Grasping abstract or counterintuitive ideas? Not so much.
Here we arrive at a dilemma—one that we all share: The modern world is extraordinarily complex, bursting with information, built around non-intuitive ideas, centered on concepts and symbols. Succeeding in this world requires focused attention, prodigious memory, capacious bandwidth, sustained motivation, logical rigor, and proficiency with abstractions. The gap between what our biological brains are capable of, and what modern life demands, is large and getting larger each day.</p>
    
    <p> With every experimental discovery, the divide between the scientific account of the world and our intuitive “folk” understanding grows more pronounced. With every terabyte of data swelling humanity’s store of knowledge, our native faculties are further outstripped. With every twist of complexity added to the world’s problems, the naked brain becomes more unequal to the task of solving them.
Our response to the cognitive challenges posed by contemporary life has been to double down on what the philosopher Andy Clark calls “brainbound” thinking —those very capacities that are, on their own, so woefully inadequate.</p>
