    <p>" Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs.
Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I think nobody ever even asked the question. Everybody always only focused on the "what" and "where;" no questions asked. But as I started my career as a research assistant in physics, I started getting interested in all the "whys" of life.</p>
    
    <p> As I studied and thought about various fundamental questions such as, "Why do we use money instead of promises or favors?"; "Why do we live in houses and not boats or cars?"; "Why are there usually 2-4 people in a home and not 10-20?"; "Why do we move away from home?"; "Why do we work until we're 65?"--all while getting assaulted with well-intended "encouragements" that I should make sure to open a retirement account before I was 30 and put 15% of net income into it; that I should buy a house; that married homeowners were more prosperous and therefore I better get married too; that I should buy a new car; that people would like me more if I wore a particular kind of brand clothing, and that I would enjoy a beverage more if it came from a certain kind of bottle. I was beginning to feel that something was wrong. "Why is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" I started getting an uneasy feeling that something about the world was not quite right. Nobody explained the "why.</p>
    
    <p>" Sure, they could explain how I should first purchase a "starter home," so I could "upgrade" later. But nobody could or would explain why I should buy a house in the first place. Nobody could or would explain why I should have a career, only that career development was important.
There are a few allegories that explain this progression in thinking.</p>
    
    <p> The oldest is Plato's Cave.4 In Plato's Cave prisoners have been arranged in a row in a dark cave since childhood. They're chained so that they can't move their bodies, and their heads are restrained too so they can only face forward, towards a wall. They can hear and speak but they can't see each other, nor can they see themselves.</p>
    
    <p> Behind them is a fire. The fire's light shows the shadows of the prisoners on the wall. Between the prisoners and the fire there are people and animals acting out a realistic play casting shadows on the wall as well. The prisoners see only the shadows, but they hear all the sounds.</p>
    
    <p> Naturally they think the world is composed of shadows on the wall and that they themselves are shadows on the wall. The shadows talk to each other and interact, and it all makes sense to the prisoners, who think that all the shadows on the wall are like themselves. The prisoners even know each other through the shadows they see and the voices they hear, and they gain status by their ability to recognize other shadows and predict what they'll do. Now, imagine that one of the prisoners is released.</p>
    
    <p>
His shackles fall to the ground and he can turn his head. He sees the other prisoners sitting in a row chained to the ground and he's horrified. He also sees the actors and animals between the prisoners and the fire. He sees the cave opening and ventures out.</p>
    
    <p> He is blinded by the light, but finally sees the big picture: All his life he has been sitting in a cave, chained to the ground, believing that the wall was it. Now he has realized that the action on the wall is guided mainly by a few actors, with the prisoners providing commentary. Now he sees the opportunities in the real world. He feels duty- bound to go back and inform the prisoners of the situation and try to release them.</p>
