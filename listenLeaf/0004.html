    <p> But accurately recalling complexinformation? Engaging in rigorous logical reasoning? Grasping abstract orcounterintuitive ideas? Not so much.Here we arrive at a dilemma—one that we all share: The modern world isextraordinarily complex, bursting with information, built around non-intuitiveideas, centered on concepts and symbols. Succeeding in this world requiresfocused attention, prodigious memory, capacious bandwidth, sustainedmotivation, logical rigor, and proficiency with abstractions. The gap betweenwhat our biological brains are capable of, and what modern life demands, islarge and getting larger each day.</p>
    
    <p> With every experimental discovery, the dividebetween the scientific account of the world and our intuitive “folk”understanding grows more pronounced. With every terabyte of data swellinghumanity’s store of knowledge, our native faculties are further outstripped. Withevery twist of complexity added to the world’s problems, the naked brainbecomes more unequal to the task of solving them.Our response to the cognitive challenges posed by contemporary life has beento double down on what the philosopher Andy Clark calls “brainbound” thinking—those very capacities that are, on their own, so woefully inadequate.</p>
    
    <p> We urgeourselves and others to grit it out, bear down, “just do it”—to think harder. But,as we often find to our frustration, the brain is made of stubborn and unyieldingstuff, its vaunted plasticity notwithstanding. Confronted by its limits, we mayconclude that we ourselves (or our children or our students or our employees)are simply not smart enough, or not “gritty” enough. In fact, it’s the way wehandle our mental shortcomings—which are, remember, endemic to our species—that is the problem.</p>
    
    <p> Our approach constitutes an instance of (as the poetWilliam Butler Yeats put it in another context) “the will trying to do the work ofthe imagination.” The smart move is not to lean ever harder on the brain but tolearn to reach beyond it.In The Middle Class Gentleman, a comedy written by the seventeenth-centuryFrench playwright Molière, the would-be aristocrat Monsieur Jourdain isdelighted by a realization that follows upon his learning the difference betweenprose and verse. “By my faith! For more than forty years I have been speakingprose without knowing anything about it!” he exclaims.</p>
    
    <p> Likewise, we may beimpressed to learn that we have long been drawing extra-neural resources intoour thinking processes—that we already think outside the brain.That’s the good news. The bad news is that we often do it haphazardly,without much intention or skill. It’s no wonder this is the case.</p>
    
    <p> Our efforts ateducation and training, as well as management and leadership, are aimed almostexclusively at promoting brainbound thinking. Beginning in elementary school,we are taught to sit still, work quietly, think hard—a model for mental activitythat will prevail during all the years that follow, through high school and collegeand into the workplace. The skills we develop and the techniques we are taughtare those that involve using our heads: committing information to memory,engaging in internal reasoning and deliberation, endeavoring to self-disciplineand self-motivate.Meanwhile, there is no corresponding cultivation of our ability to thinkoutside the brain—no instruction, for instance, in how to tune in to the body’sinternal signals, sensations that can profitably guide our choices and decisions.</p>
    
    <p>We’re not trained to use bodily movements and gestures to understand highlyconceptual subjects like science and mathematics, or to come up with novel andoriginal ideas. Schools don’t teach students how to restore their depletedattention with exposure to nature and the outdoors, or how to arrange their studyspaces so that they extend intelligent thought. Teachers and managers don’tdemonstrate how abstract ideas can be turned into physical objects that can bemanipulated and transformed in order to achieve insights and solve problems.Employees aren’t shown how the social practices of imitation and vicariouslearning can shortcut the process of acquiring expertise.</p>
    
    <p> Classroom groups andworkplace teams aren’t coached in scientifically validated methods of increasingworkplace teams aren’t coached in scientifically validated methods of increasingthe collective intelligence of their members. Our ability to think outside the brainhas been left almost entirely uneducated and undeveloped.This oversight is the regrettable result of what has been called our“neurocentric bias”—that is, our idealization and even fetishization of the brain—and our corresponding blind spot for all the ways cognition extends beyondthe skull. (As the comedian Emo Philips has remarked: “I used to think that thebrain was the most wonderful organ in my body.</p>
    
    <p> Then I realized who was tellingme this.”) Seen from another perspective, however, this near-universal neglectrepresents an auspicious opportunity—a world of unrealized potential. Untilrecently, science shared the larger culture’s neglect of thinking outside the brain.But this is no longer the case.</p>
    
    <p> Psychologists, cognitive scientists, andneuroscientists are now able to provide a clear picture of how extra-neural inputsshape the way we think. Even more promising, they offer practical guidelines forenhancing our thinking through the use of these outside-the-brain resources.Such developments are unfolding against the backdrop of a broader shift in howwe view the mind—and, by extension, how we understand ourselves.But first—to gain a sense of where we’ve been and where we’re headed, it’sworth taking several steps back in time, to the moment when our current ideasabout the brain were born.</p>
