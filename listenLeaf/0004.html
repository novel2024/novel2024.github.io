    <p> They have had years of practice to perfect the Mr.
Charming act.
When two normal people with no hidden agendas meet, the interaction that occurs is natural, sometimes awkward and often superficial. That is, there is likely to be a whole lot of small talk to fill the silences instead of deep heartfelt conversations.</p>
    
    <p> The latter conversations happen after you have gotten to know each other a little better. Be cautious of anyone who tries to charmingly divulge any unnecessary information that paints them as this perfect human who is incapable of making a wrong move. Be careful of anyone who always has the perfect answer to all questions. Lastly, be wary of anyone who seems to float effortlessly through social interactions.</p>
    
    <p> This kind of person may be a well-meaning social butterfly, but there is also a chance that they are putting on a show that you will pay greatly for.
Entitlement is the order of the day Have you ever come across someone who behaves as if the world owes them something? This kind of person must have what they want at whatever cost. If they do not, they will throw a tantrum and make everyone pay for it.
Human predators are often entitled people.</p>
    
    <p> This is the reason why they often have no problem getting what they want at whatever cost--even if it means hurting others. After all, the world is in their debt, and this debt must be repaid even if it means stepping on a few or many toes along the way.
At the workplace, entitlement is played out in the form of a colleague who believes they deserve a promotion by virtue of any reason that they come up with. This kind of employee will go to great lengths to ensure that the boss gives them the promotion that they believe they have earned even if they barely pull their weight at the office.</p>
    
    <p> They will try to make everyone else look bad and undeserving of the promotion. If they do not get their way and the promotion goes to someone else, they will consider that person their life-long enemy. After all, how could that person take away their promotion? It will never occur to this entitled employee that they probably need to work harder to rise up the ranks.
They love being in control Most people love having some control in certain aspects of their lives.</p>
    
    <p> It is normal to want to be able to call the shots, within reasonable bounds. The problem begins when a particular person feels that they need to call the shots in their lives and in other people'sâ€™ lives. Most manipulators are control freaks. Some of them have subtle ways of expressing this control,
while others could not be bothered to make it less obvious.</p>
    
    <p> If you have a control freak in your life, you probably already know it. Control freaks are often hard to miss thanks to their ability to involve themselves in just about anything and everything. At the workplace, control freaks have a very hard time delegating to others, even when it is necessary. They want to run each and every show because they know the reward is theirs to reap.</p>
    
    <p>
Another sign of a control freak is the inability to admit when they are wrong. Humans are prone to error, and it requires a certain level of grace to accept that you are on the wrong. This is a kind of grace that most control freaks lack. A reason why people who love to be in control find it hard to admit error is that they view it as an admission to being weak, which contradicts their idealized self-image that they are better than everybody else.</p>
