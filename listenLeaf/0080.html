    <p> His right arm is bent at an awkward angle, and his right leg drags stiffly behind him. Across the room, a young woman is asked if she can touch her nose with her index finger; she tries, but her finger misses the mark and lands on her cheek.
On this day, the often uncanny symptoms of neurological disease are on vivid display. But these individuals are not patients; they are medical students, doctors display.</p>
    
    <p> But these individuals are not patients; they are medical students, doctors in training. Coached by their professors, they are learning how to mimic the symptoms of the ailments they will be called upon to treat. Instructors show the students how to arrange their facial features, how to move their hands, how to sit and stand and walk. Faculty members also guide the responses of another contingent of students, dressed in white lab coats, who are role-playing the physicians they will become.</p>
    
    <p> After extensive practice, the “patients” and “doctors” will perform a series of clinical vignettes for their peers from the stage of the hospital’s amphitheater.
Jean-Martin Charcot, the nineteenth-century physician known as the father of neurology, practiced and taught at this very institution. Charcot brought his patients onstage with him as he lectured, allowing his students to see firsthand the many forms neurological disease could take. Imitating such forms with one’s own face and body is an even more effective means of learning, maintains Emmanuel Roze, who introduced his “mime-based role-play training program” to the students at Pitié-Salpêtrière in 2015.</p>
    
    <p> Roze, a consulting neurologist at the hospital and a professor of neurology at Sorbonne University, had become concerned that traditional modes of instruction were not supporting students’ acquisition of knowledge, and were not dispelling students’ apprehension in the face of neurological illness. He reasoned that actively imitating the distinctive symptoms of such maladies—the tremors of Parkinson’s, the jerky movements of chorea, the slurred speech of cerebellar syndrome—could help students learn while defusing their discomfort.
And indeed, a study conducted by Roze and his colleagues found that two and a half years after their neurological rotation, medical students who had participated in the miming program recalled neurological signs and symptoms much better than students who had received only conventional instruction centered on lectures and textbooks. Medical students who had simulated their patients’ symptoms also reported that the experience deepened their understanding of neurological illness and increased their motivation to learn about it.</p>

In an earlier chapter on sensations, we saw that our automatic and unconscious mimicry of other people helps us understand them better—aids us in sensing their emotions, for example. The same is true for more deliberate imitation. Researchers have demonstrated, for instance, that intentionally imitating someone’s accent allows us to comprehend more easily the words the person is speaking (a finding that might readily be applied to second-language learning). When we copy the accent of our conversation partner—when we produce the sounds that individual is making with our own mouth—we become better able to predict, and thus to make sense of, what he or she is saying.</p>
    
    <p> As with the medical students at Pitié-Salpêtrière, it’s a matter of attaining understanding from the inside, of taking aspects of the other into ourselves.
We also come to feel more positive about the people whose speech we mimic —an effect that holds true for imitation more generally. Emmanuel Roze has found that the experience of imitating patients makes the young doctors he trains more empathetic, as well as more comfortable with the signs of their patients’ disorders. Imitation permits us to extend to the other some of the familiar regard we feel for ourselves, as well as some of the insight we gain from inhabiting the role of dynamic actor in the world, rather than that of passive observer.</p>
    
    <p> It is a general purpose strategy with boundless applications in education, in the workplace, and in the learning we do on our own time.
There’s just one problem: as a society we are suspicious of imitation,
regarding it as juvenile, disreputable, even morally wrong. It’s a reaction Roze has come to know well. Despite the demonstrated benefits of mime-based role play, many of his fellow medical school professors have expressed apprehension about implementing the practice.</p>
    
    <p> Some of his students, too, initially voiced discomfort at the prospect of imitating patients. Roze is careful to note that those who participate are in no way mocking or making fun of their charges. In fact,
he says, the act of imitation is imbued with respect: it’s treating patients as the ultimate authority, as the experts on what it’s like to have their condition.
The conventional approach to cognition has persuaded us that the only route to more intelligent thinking lies in cultivating our own brain.</p>
