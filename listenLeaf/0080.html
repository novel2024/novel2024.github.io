    <p> Put in the effort where the yield is highest. The yield is highest where the marginal increase of the return relative to the marginal increase of effort is the highest. In mathematical terms, this occurs where the derivative of the equation above is 0, that is,
(d)/(dP)(dP)/(dE)=(d)/(dP)[P(1-P)] = 1-2P = 0 => P = (1)/(2) This means that the maximum return happens in the middle of the curve. This becomes obvious if we plot dP/dE, which is shown in this figure.</p>
    
    <p> This has a lot of bearing on the discussion of decoupling in Decoupling and increasing complexity. In particular, the dynamic region is in the middle of this figure and this figure. The instant response, which requires 100% effort, is to the right and the static (no) response, which requires 0% effort, is to the left.
A curve relating additional reward to additional effort.</p>

To give an example, professionals are often encouraged to hyperspecialize, that is to put in maximum effort so that they'll achieve maximum production (upper right of this figure), to win the competition with other professionals and attract the highest salary. If money is the only utility that matters, this is the optimal strategy. If, however, happiness, low stress, leisure time, or other things in the work-life balance also matter, it would result in a different strategy, since the last, say 80% of the effort, to gain the last 20% of the results, would be wasted. Once you understand the maximum power principle intuitively, it'll be quite easy to follow.</p>
    
    <p> In the simplest terms, it says that you can gain the maximum utility by being relatively competent in large numbers of topics by contributing a nontrivial but fairly small effort. This means that you may gain more utility by being competent (journeyman level) in 10 different topics than by spending the same amount of time to become an expert in a single topic.
A Renaissance lifestyle Few consciously think about complex strategies in daily living. On a daily basis, a functional strategy is invisible.</p>
    
    <p> Rarely do we step back and re- examine our strategy (lifestyle design). Most of the time we simply adopt the tactics that are handed down through the system without a second thought (see The Lock-on).
Now, it's possible to improve normal consumer budgets by several percent by utilizing tips and hacks to optimize the efficiency of existing tactics. Keep in mind, however, that hacking existing methods isn't going to accomplish the same level of satisfaction as devising new methods that are more suitable to the new strategy.</p>
    
    <p> One doesn't win a trench war against machine guns by improving the cavalry. Substantial improvements don't happen incrementally by patching existing methods; they require a complete redesign.
Until now, we have concentrated on the theoretical foundations and guiding principles of the Renaissance life. In this chapter I'll describe the trees of this forest.</p>
    
    <p> Just as early humans built fires and shelter and planted seeds to modify their environment, we should modify our environment in ways that are beneficial rather than detrimental to our goals. When the environment can't be changed, we'll adapt ourselves to flow along with the environment instead of struggling against it. It should be realized that it'll rarely be possible to change the environment on a grand scale and build a utopia--that is, unless you and the rest of the world all do what I say. Most tactics will therefore be executed in the current environment.</p>
    
    <p> However,
they'll often be carried out with an entirely different goal in mind-- becoming independently wealthy and financially independent within five years.
The methods for doing so will be simple. I won't present any tips that haven't been seen before and which one can't find described in detail in hundreds of other books. Success won't depend on becoming famous on the Internet or getting a book deal, nor will it depend on a timely participation in a market bubble of junk bonds, internet companies, real estate, gold, or tulips.</p>
