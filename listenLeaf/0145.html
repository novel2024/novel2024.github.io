If an emergency is expected to last 6 months, one thus needs 6 times as much money. With the 10% savings rate it will take 6×6 months, or 3 years to build this fund. If emergencies happen more frequently, which isn't completely unlikely, then one will be wiped out because there is not enough time to rebuild the emergency fund.
Consider another example for someone with the same savings rate,
10%, but here only 20% is spent on needs while 70% is spent on wants.</p>
    
    <p> In this case it only takes 2 months of savings to replace 1 month of spending on needs. If the emergency fund is for the same duration (6 months), the time it takes to fully fund the emergency fund is 1 year instead of the 3 years in the first example. This means that for the same savings rate, a budget dominated by flexible (loosely coupled) wants is more resilient than a budget dominated by inflexible (tightly coupled) needs.
Now consider a third example.</p>
    
    <p> Here the savings rate is 20%, needs are 20% and wants are 60%. Here it takes 1 month of savings to replace 1 month of spending on needs. To create the 6 month emergency fund only takes half a year. This is the safest distribution of spending and saving of the three examples.</p>
    
    <p> But one can do better, as will be shown below.
The conclusion here is that the higher the ratio of savings rate to needs,
the safer one is from emergencies. Also, the higher the ratio of wants to needs (more wants, fewer needs), the safer the person is. It should now be easy to calculate the size of an emergency fund.</p>
    
    <p> All you need is to identify your needs relative your income, your savings relative to your income, and the expected duration of your emergency (how long it will take to find a new job--this depends on your profession and the economy). You also need to estimate the frequency of your emergencies (how often you expect to get laid off).
Savings rate for financial independence An emergency fund represents financial independence on the simplest level, because it means that given an emergency, there's no need to finance (borrow money to replace) living expenses.
Let us consider the required savings rate to replace both needs and wants.</p>
    
    <p> If the savings rate is 10%, needs and wants total 90% and therefore it takes (90/10=) 9 years of working to save enough money to spend on needs and wants for 1 year of not working. If the savings rate is 20%, needs and wants total 80% and so it takes (80/20=) 4 years of working to replace 1 year of spending. If the savings rate is 50%, 1 year of working saves enough money to take 1 year off. This table shows the calculations for all cases using the formula (1-r)/r (for example, for 20%, r=0.</p>
    
    <p>20 so (1- 0.2)/0.2=4) for the top half and r/(1-r) for the bottom half. Note that this calculation doesn't consider emergency and retirement savings.</p>
    
    <p> If you like,
include retirement savings and emergency fund savings under general spending.
Simple savings rate calculations without interest rate.
Intermittent work It's important to note that the time units in the table are irrelevant. Given a 50% savings rate, there's no rule that one has to work 1 year and take the next year off, although this solution is growing in popularity.</p>
