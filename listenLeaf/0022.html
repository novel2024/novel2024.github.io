    <p> This is something that many cult leaders have mastered and would explain why many cult meetings are often long and dreary. You will rarely find that a cult meeting has ended in a few minutes. If you conclude a meeting in fifteen minutes, the attendants’ minds will still be sharp and questioning. But if you go on and on for hours, they begin to slip out of consciousness unknowingly and will not be as opposed to your suggestions as they would have been in the first fifteen minutes.</p>
    
    <p>
Another tactic that is used to achieve hypnosis is the presentation of contradicting information as if it is not contradicting but totally logical.
What does this mean?  As mentioned earlier in this chapter, there is a part of your brain that thinks critically. This part of the brain is what keeps you alive and out of trouble by helping you process important information.
When this part of the brain is bombarded with contradictory information without being given sufficient time to process it, it shuts down.</p>
    
    <p> (That is why it is always so important to step back and process information especially when you feel as if you are being rushed to make a decision in any situation). When your critical thinking has been bypassed, you are likely to accept any suggestions given to you even though these would not be accepted by a normal-thinking person who is in tune with the logical parts of their mind.
How to Hypnotize Someone Without Them Knowing In everyday life, you can use hypnosis to get what you want out of people without them suspecting what you are up to. A good thing about hypnosis as a tool of manipulation is that it is subtle and leaves behind no evidence.</p>
    
    <p>
Unlike lying where you might get caught up in your lies, hypnosis leaves no traces behind. Nobody will walk up to you and accuse you of hypnotizing them into doing something. In the worst-case scenario, you are only going to be accused of having a way with something.

    <p>
What they don’t know is that you have mastered the art of hypnotizing ladies into doing exactly as you say.
The first step to successfully hypnotizing a person is to form a connection with them. Very rarely will you be able to hypnotize a stranger with whom you share no bond at all. Forming a connection with a person is relatively easy.</p>
    
    <p> You just need to watch your body language and theirs as well, and their facial expressions and respond appropriately. The whole point of establishing a connection is to ensure that the other person is open to you and will respond favorably to your subtle mind control, otherwise known as hypnosis. After making certain of the existence of some rapport between you and your subject, make use of any of the following tips to hypnotize them:
Tip #1: Throw them off the familiar The human mind loves patterns. They are easy to interpret, predictable, and comforting.</p>
    
    <p> Patterns are a big component of the comfort zone and do not require a whole lot of critical thinking. What are the patterns you have established in your life, and how do they help you? For many people,
patterns simplify life. Let’s consider a simple pattern that can be interrupted with the intention of hypnotizing a person. Let’s say you and your spouse have a way of saying goodbye every morning before work that involves a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek.</p>
    
    <p> One morning, you are feeling particularly philanthropic and decide to replace your pattern with a tight lingering hug and a full kiss on the lips. Your spouse’s mind will be thrown into disarray because that is not what the mind is used to. In the five seconds of confusion that will ensue in your spouse’s mind, you will have a narrow window for a hypnotic command.
