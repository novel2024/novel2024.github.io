The knowledge of a natural philosopher in the 17th century was so broad that he would cover several fields such as mathematics, physics,
chemistry, meteorology, etc.Â (illustrated by a broad bell curve) Compared to a modern-day scientist the natural philosopher's knowledge on a specific topic could be said to have been remedial at best. On the other hand, a modern scientist knows very little, even when it comes to basic things, outside his own field of specialization.
This is solved by having many more scientists, each covering their own narrow subfield.</p>
    
    <p>
It's important to realize, though, that just because humans are getting more specialized doesn't mean they're getting smarter. Given these limitations, it's clear that the depth of specialization comes at the cost of narrowness of specialization. Having a narrow but deep knowledge means that one doesn't have much broad knowledge or broadly applicable skills.
The marketplace compensates for this by making available, at a price, the products produced by other specialists.</p>
    
    <p> However, the individual specialist is subject to the risk of being stuck with a useless skill if the demand for their particular skill suddenly vanishes due to outsourcing, or stagnating wages due to competition. Specialists that have invested their entire knowledge in skills useful for employment risk suddenly finding themselves without income in a changing world. Hence a lot of effort goes into continuously acquiring new skills while discarding old ones. Many find it stressful to keep up with the technological drift of their specialization as new methods are continuously introduced, requiring them to discard previously acquired knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>
This figure shows a narrow delta function representing the skills of a specialist. A dotted line and an arrow represents the shift in demand.
The demand now lies almost entirely out of the specialist's supply.
This requires the specialist to work very hard to stay on target.</p>
    
    <p> The figure also shows a wider bell curve that represents the skills of the generalist. During a similar demand shift, the overlap between the new demand and the generalist's supply is substantial.
Here, a large problem is that previously acquired, specialized knowledge can't be used as a foundation for new specialized knowledge--by definition, only generalized knowledge can serve this purpose. The only thing the specialist knows is how much effort it took to reach the level of the former specialization and that this must now be repeated probably several more times throughout his career.</p>
    
    <p>
In other words, a specialist has acquired a lot of specialized knowledge at a cheap unit cost in order to be competitive. However, given the low unit cost, this knowledge is not a solid basis for further professional growth;
rather, it's expendable. The means to survival for a specialist is his ability to rapidly learn new subjects, quickly produce saleable works, and then move on. This is called skimming.</p>
    
    <p> It's the same strategy pursued by weeds, to use an ecological analogy. At the expert level (see Gauging mastery), a person needs 80-100 hours a week to stay competitive. For masters level, it's 60-80 hours, and to remain competent requires 40-60 hours a week.
The professional need to forget and relearn can be hard to accept,
especially for dedicated specialists who personally identify with, self- actualize through, and take pride in the knowledge they have spent years acquiring.</p>
    
    <p> These are people who consider their work an expression of who they are. They usually produce the best work, the "cathedrals" of their professions. Conversely, they're also at the highest risk of burning out when the market or their employers force them to tear down their cathedrals and build something else. Those who maintain a professional distance from their knowledge and treat it like school courses and exam-passing fare better.</p>
