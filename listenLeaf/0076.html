Erick Greene, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Montana, has relied on his field notebooks throughout his long career. His stacks of spiral-bound notebooks contain descriptions of macaws and parrots flying at dusk to roost in palm swamps in Peru; of the “wahoo” alarm calls of olive baboons in the Okavango Delta of Botswana, warning one another of approaching lions; of teenage male sperm whales flipping up their tails as they begin their hour-long dives to catch giant squid in a deepwater trench off New Zealand. But his notes are not merely a record of what he has observed and experienced; they are, he says, “the main source of ideas that take my research in new directions.” Seeking to give his students a sense of this process, Greene assigned a field notebook exercise in the upper-level ecology class he teaches to UM undergraduates.</p>
    
    <p> He asked them to “pick one thing” and observe it carefully over the entire semester; the object of study could be a single tree, a bird feeder, a beaver dam, the student’s own garden. This was not, he stressed to his class, a rote exercise in recording but a highly generative activity, the starting point of scientific discovery. “One of the main things I wanted to get across is that one of the hardest parts of science is coming up with new questions,” says Greene.
“Where do fresh new ideas come from? Careful observations of nature are a great place to start.</p>
    
    <p>” In addition to making observations of their chosen site over time, students were required to come up with at least ten research questions inspired by what they saw.
As Greene’s students discovered, the very act of noticing and selecting points of interest to put down on paper initiates a more profound level of mental processing. Things really get interesting, however, when we pause and look back at what we’ve written. Representations in the mind and representations on the page may seem roughly equivalent, when in fact they differ significantly in terms of what psychologists call their “affordances”—that is, what we’re able to do with them.</p>
    
    <p> External representations, for example, are more definite than internal ones. Picture a tiger, suggests philosopher Daniel Dennett in a classic thought experiment; imagine in detail its eyes, its nose, its paws, its tail.
Following a few moments of conjuring, we may feel we’ve summoned up a fairly complete image. Now, says Dennett, answer this question: How many stripes does the tiger have? Suddenly the mental picture that had seemed so solid becomes maddeningly slippery.</p>
    
    <p> If we had drawn the tiger on paper, of course,
counting its stripes would be a straightforward task.
Here, then, is one of the unique affordances of an external representation: we can apply one or more of our physical senses to it. As the tiger example shows,
“seeing” an image in our mind’s eye is not the same as seeing it on the page.
Daniel Reisberg, a professor emeritus of psychology at Reed College in Oregon,
calls this shift in perspective the “detachment gain”: the cognitive benefit we receive from putting a bit of distance between ourselves and the content of our minds.</p>
    
    <p> When we do so, we can see more clearly what that content is made of— how many stripes are on the tiger, so to speak. This measure of space also allows us to activate our powers of recognition. We leverage these powers whenever we write down two or more ways to spell a word, seeking the one that “looks right.” The curious thing about this common practice is that we do tend to know immediately which spelling appears correct—indicating that this is knowledge we already possess but can’t access until it is externalized.</p>

A similar phenomenon has been reported by researchers investigating science learning. In a study published in 2016, experimenters asked eighth-grade students to illustrate with drawings the operation of a mechanical system (a bicycle pump) and a chemical system (the bonding of atoms to form molecules).
Generating visual explanations of how these systems work led the students to achieve a deeper level of understanding; without any additional instruction,
participants were able to use their own drawings as a “check for completeness and coherence as well as a platform for inference,” the researchers note. Turning a mental representation into shapes and lines on a page supported the students’ growing understanding, helping them to elucidate more fully what they already knew about these scientific systems.</p>
    
    <p> At the same time, the explicitness—the definiteness—of the drawings they made revealed with ruthless rigor what the students did not yet know or understand, leading them to fill in the gaps thus exposed.
So external representations are more definite than internal ones—and yet, in another sense, they are also more usefully ambiguous. When a representation remains inside our heads, there’s no mystery about what it signifies; it’s our thought, and so “there can be neither doubt nor ambiguity about what is intended,” notes Daniel Reisberg. Once we’ve placed it on the page, however,
we can riff on it, play with it, take it in new directions; it can almost seem as if we ourselves didn’t make it.</p>
