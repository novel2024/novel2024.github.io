    <p> Once this mental constraint has been removed, it becomes possible to bodge.
For example, did you know you can remove rust by scrubbing it with a pad of aluminum foil? I found out on the Internet. Make a pad out of the foil, put some light oil on it and scrub away. Once you understand why this works (aluminum foil is harder than rust but softer than the good metal and even most paint jobs), you realize that the oil is just there to provide lubrication.</p>
    
    <p> You could use anything, including spit.
For more advanced rust removal you can use electrolysis. While many hobbyists and mechanics use this method routinely, most have only seen this in action in a high school or university laboratory and haven't thought that the principle could be applied "outside the box" of a laboratory setting.
Use a 2Amp nondigital car battery charger for the electric source and sodium carbonate (also known as "washing soda"50 or "pH-Upper" or "booster" for your pool) mixed in water for your electrolyte.</p>
    
    <p> Attach the part to be cleaned to the negative clamp and some piece of scrap iron to the positive clamp. Bodging enters because you don't need to specifically use sodium carbonate. You could also use sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. The only downside of sodium bicarbonate is that it doesn't work as well, but it will work.</p>
    
    <p> The concentration of sodium carbonate doesn't matter very much (more is slightly faster), nor does the current (higher is slightly faster). If you understand the principle of how ions move,
you'll quickly realize that rust is removed along the line of sight to the positive clamp. However, you don't need to understand this to observe that it works. Just keep repeating to yourself, "This isn't rocket science.</p>
    
    <p>" However, bodging requires another skill to be developed--common sense.
We have been educated to follow instructions because it moves personal responsibility one level of management up. Yet if you're bodging, all responsibility is yours. You must know what you're doing.</p>
    
    <p> Notice that bubbles appear around the negative clamp. This is hydrogen. Hydrogen is explosive, think "Hindenburg disaster," so don't use the water in your rust removal setup to extinguish cigarettes and keep it in a ventilated area. This is common sense.</p>
    
    <p> Furthermore, you might think that ordinary kitchen salt might make a great electrolyte. However, the chemical name of kitchen salt is sodium chloride. Since we are bodging we might produce some unintended consequences. If the ingredients are sodium and chlorine, those consequences are chlorine gas,51 which was used as a war gas in World War I, and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda).</p>
    
    <p>
From a general knowledge of history and chemistry, it should therefore be clear that kitchen salt and sparks (from cigarettes or nearby battery chargers) should be avoided. Also, don't stick your hands into the conducting water. Bodging doesn't require an advanced education, but it does require a real education connecting what you've learned to real-world problems.
It's interesting to note that the more you know, the more likely you are to worry about the risks of bodging.</p>
