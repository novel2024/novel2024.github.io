If you work from home, it's the location relative to your customers that matters. If you don't need to go to your customers physically, this doesn't matter at all. If you can grow most of your own food, location relative to your food supply doesn't matter either. You may want to consider getting food shipped.</p>
    
    <p> Run the calculation. And of course, if you're loaded, you don't need to worry about cost--but then why are you reading this chapter?
For now, let's assume that all three are important, as they would be for most people.
For renting, the method I use is to go to Craig's List and click on "housing." Then I put in my limits: $200 minimum (because that removes a lot of useless search results) and $350 maximum.</p>
    
    <p> If you're two people with an income, you could put $400-$700. It's likely that for certain areas,
houses or apartments are simply out of range. In this case, consider cohousing, roommates, etc. In particular, consider radical alternatives.</p>
    
    <p> We currently live in a motorhome, for example. In addition, some of the cheaper places may not be heavily advertised. We lived in the same place for two years before discovering an option that was $400/month instead of $660/month. Ask around! If you're priced out of the market, you should consider other areas.</p>
    
    <p> I wouldn't be too tied to a particular city. Indeed, a frequent excuse is that, "I need to live here." Actually, unless you can document some critical need--for example, a medical reason for a particular climate--you only want to live in a particular place. This want, then, comes down to paying extra versus your other goals.</p>
    
    <p>
The search should result in several potential addresses. Next, find routes to work and groceries respectively. Get a map and some tacks. Mark your work address and the potential housing addresses and trace out connecting routes, then calculate the distances.</p>
    
    <p> There are online tools that make this easy.
I highly recommend not owning a car (but see Driving for a possible exception!), since transportation will most likely be your second largest expense. Therefore, check to see if those streets are walkable or bikeable-- no disappearing sidewalks, killer intersections, or killer people. Online, you can use satellite views of the map at maximum resolution to scan for sidewalks.</p>
    
    <p> Unfortunately, this requirement sometimes results in detours that can turn a three mile route into a four mile one. Also get a map of bus stops or other public transportation. Buses will extend your range. If you live one mile from a bus stop and your work is one mile from another bus stop, your effective distance is two miles.</p>
