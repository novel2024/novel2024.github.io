    <p> “But what is gossip?” asks Sandy Pentland, a computational scientist and MIT professor who has conducted many studies demonstrating the benefits of workplace interaction. “Gossip is stories about what happened and what you did” in response. He adds: “If you think about what needs to happen for a healthy organization, people need to know the rules of the road. They need to know how things are done.</p>
    
    <p> Which means they have to hear the stories.” The space where such interactions unfold is also important. In the case of the medical transport teams Myers studied, the designated storytelling locale was a ten-by-fifteen-foot area near the door to the helipad, just outside a supply room.
Over time, this unassuming spot became the unofficial site for trading job- related anecdotes.</p>
    
    <p> The informality of the space was part of its appeal and part of its value. Myers notes that there was another, more formal space set aside for the transport nurses to share stories: the weekly doctor-supervised meetings known as “grand rounds.” The patient case studies presented at these meetings were “cleaner,” he reports—more focused and concise—than the stories recounted outside the supply room. But in polishing up their narratives, the nurses often omitted just those details that would be most useful to their colleagues should they encounter a similar situation in the future.</p>
    
    <p>
Such nitty-gritty details constitute what psychologists call “tacit knowledge”:
information about how things are done, when, and under which circumstances.
It’s what gets left out of the depersonalized information employees encounter in more formal meetings and training sessions. It’s also where the “knowledge management systems” in which so many firms have invested go wrong: the information such systems make available is devoid of context, stripped of detail,
and thereby rendered all but useless. “Much of the knowledge needed for employees to learn and thrive at work is not the kind of formal, codified information that is typically documented in online repositories or knowledge management systems,” Myers notes.</p>
    
    <p> “Instead, what is often critical for success is mastery of the tacit knowledge of the organization—the complex, often subtle interpretive knowledge that is difficult to capture or write down.” The disappointing track record of such repositories makes Myers think of another interview he conducted, this one with a professional at a large tech company. This employee’s organization had invested millions of dollars in a sophisticated knowledge management system, intended to codify the expertise held inside the heads of the company’s workforce. “I use the knowledge management system all the time,” he assured Myers—but not in the way the company’s leaders intended: “I just scroll down to the bottom of the entry to see who wrote it, and then I call them on the phone.</p>
    
    <p>” What this individual is seeking is richly contextualized information, full of detail and nuance; what he’s looking for, in short, is a story.
9 Thinking with Groups AFTER SEVERAL DAYS conducting military drills off the coast of California, the USS Palau was headed home. The massive aircraft carrier, large enough to transport twenty-five helicopters, was steaming into San Diego Harbor at a brisk clip. Inside the pilothouse—located on the navigation bridge, two levels up from the flight deck—the mood was buoyant.</p>
    
    <p> Members of the crew would soon be disembarking and enjoying themselves on shore. Conversation turned to where they would go for dinner that night. Then, suddenly, the intercom erupted with the voice of the ship’s engineer.
“Bridge, Main Control,” he barked.</p>
    
    <p> “I am losing steam drum pressure. No apparent cause. I’m shutting my throttles.” A junior officer, working under the supervision of the ship’s navigator, moved quickly to the intercom and spoke into it, acknowledging, “Shutting throttles,
aye.</p>
