In this book we're not focused on the necessary policy decisions, but rather what the individual decisions should be. An economic system has trophic levels like an ecosystem with groups or socioeconomic strata feeding off each other. In a growth economy, there are workers, organizers of workers,
owners of assets, and owners of land. In a complete ecology, there are abiotics, producers, consumers, and decomposers.</p>
    
    <p>
Humans are sufficiently adaptable to execute any of these roles in either system. Economic decision-making must be expanded to include all these factors. Until such an understanding is codified into human behavior via law, religion, and values, something that those who profit from the current setup are not apt to do anytime soon, individuals need to act as if such a code already existed, since economic decision-making eventually does catch up to reality. The economy has many unrecognized inefficiencies--it is, for example, possible for more people to play the role of decomposers (recycling, upcycling) and producers as well as becoming less dependent on abiotic resources.</p>
    
    <p> The challenge is to do this within the existing framework.
Net savings--lifetime income minus lifetime expenses--equals a person's contribution to society. It illustrates how much the person has given versus how much the person has taken on an economic basis, as measured in money. Using the saved money, it's possible to acquire productive factors by trading.</p>
    
    <p> In a less specialized society, imagine having spent the time building and accumulating tools and other productive factors that make work more productive. The same society also allows for a conversion of tools back into money for spending. It's a more abstract way of arranging matters than building a shoe-making machine which is capable of outputting a lifetime of shoes, rather than having it output a pair of shoes every decade after the previous pair have worn out. "Investing" is simply the process of putting this idea into practice.</p>
    
    <p> An "investor" is thus a person who lives from his assets. A capitalist is an "investor." A hunter-gatherer,
who has a way of life that has survived for tens of thousands of years, is to a large extent also an "investor." "Investing" typically requires a great deal of knowledge and familiarity with one's assets.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, "working" requires a great deal of energy and vigor. This is why hunter-gatherers protect their old and why farmers historically have focused on having many children. From the worker's perspective, an industrial society is closer to the farming community. In this case, the crops are people, specifically the products made by people.</p>
    
    <p> From the investor's perspective, it's the capital market that is of primary focus. Here experience and wisdom are more important.
For an investor, the start of financial independence includes a strong vision of one day creating a metaphorical forest and living harmoniously with the forest. It starts by planting seeds.</p>
    
    <p> These seeds grow into saplings and the mind starts connecting the vision to the upcoming reality of a mature forest. When you live for the future, your present will very much be determined by the actions of your past. Hence, you'll only live in a forest if your past self at some point decided to plant the seeds.
Contrast this with living for the present, in which case your future will be uncertain.</p>
