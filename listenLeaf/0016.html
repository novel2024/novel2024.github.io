    <p> But at the end of the day, the person who goes to bed believing they are the worst of the worst (thanks to other people’s feedback) sleeps more restlessly. Of course, having high self-esteem and a solid sense of self protects you from the predators looking to prey on you, but that is a topic for another chapter.
The outcome of the first step of brainwashing is a full-blown identity crisis that the predator can prey on for the purposes of the second step.
Step 2: Guilt-tripping Guilt may be a useless emotion, as it has been called, but it is also a very powerful emotion.</p>
    
    <p> Guilt can make you promise things that are out of your scope as a person. Guilt will have you staying up at night wondering why you are such a horrible human being when in fact you are not. The power of guilt is constantly being harnessed by the human predators around us.
The second stage of brainwashing works this way: the brainwasher has already convinced their victim that they are not what they have always thought themselves to be.</p>
    
    <p> The victim is hence in a state of confusion as they seek to answer the identity question for themselves. That is, if they are not a good person, then who are they? At this point, the predator swoops in and starts taking them for all the guilt trip of their life. When you are unsure of who you are, it can be very easy to believe every lie that you are fed about yourself. A brainwasher will make statements that convince their victim that they are essentially a bad person, regardless of the context that this adjective is used.</p>
    
    <p>
For instance, a brainwasher might try to convince a young mom that they are a bad person and a bad mother because they have agreed to vaccinate their kids or prefer the bottle to the breast. A predator will take every opportunity to remind the victim that they lack in a specific field or in all fields of their lives and that the only way to redemption is to listen to and accept what the predator has to offer. The predator is merciless in their attack on the victim because the end goal is to break down the victim to the point where they are helpless and completely free of their authentic self-image and identity.
Steps 3 and 4: Self-betrayal and breaking point Most people are fiercely loyal to themselves.</p>
    
    <p> They will defend themselves and their actions and fight to have their voices heard. Even those people who are unable to stand up for others are often able to stand up for themselves. A brainwashed person is the complete opposite. After constantly being bombarded with messages of being the opposite of what they have believed themselves to be, brainwashed persons have no problem denouncing themselves and everything else attached to them.</p>
    
    <p> These include their relatives, friends, belief system, and any other associations that they might have that connect them to their old identity which the brainwasher has ‘evaluated’ and found ‘severely lacking.’ There are certain reasons why a brainwashed person easily finds themselves in this step and unable to fight back. For starters, they have already gone through the first two steps and come out feeling disoriented and drowning in doubt and guilt. More often than not, they do not have the energy to fight back.</p>
    
    <p> Keep in mind that sometimes there is the risk of physical harm if compliance is not achieved, so the target might be too afraid to contradict all the messages that they receive from the predator. At the same time, guilty people have a way of wanting to make up for their sins. For some people,
especially those who have been broken down through brainwashing, making up involves cutting ties with everything connected to their ‘sinful’ past.
Unfortunately, what often happens is that the victim is often left in an even worse place after they have disowned their friends, relative, and belief system.</p>
    
    <p> The shame and guilt they felt before increases. After all, they are now a traitor, and the fact that they could not be loyal to their circle is proof enough that they are as bad a person as the predator surmised. It is quite easy to see that brainwashing is psychological warfare that aims at tearing down a person to the point where they are unable to think coherently and independently. It is all-consuming and exhausting, and victims often have a really difficult time extricating themselves from the jaws of their predators,
especially if they make it through the other stages of the brainwashing process.</p>
