    <p> He recommends taking a few moments to feel the body as a whole and to sense the rising and falling of the abdomen with each in-breath and out-breath. We then begin a “sweep” of the body, starting with the toes of the left foot. Advises Kabat-Zinn, “As you direct your attention to your toes, see if you can channel your breathing to them as well, so that it feels as if you are breathing in to your toes and out from your toes.” After focusing on the toes for a few breaths, we shift our attention to the sole of our foot, the heel, the ankle, and so on up to the left hip.</p>
    
    <p> The same procedure is repeated for the right leg, focusing on each section for the length of a few breaths. The roving spotlight of our attention now travels up through the torso, the abdomen and chest, the back and shoulders, then down each arm to the elbows, wrists, and hands. Finally, the attentional spotlight moves up through the neck and face. If our attention should wander during the exercise, we can gently guide it back to the part of the body that is the object of focus.</p>
    
    <p> Kabat-Zinn recommends doing the body scan at least once a day.
The aim of this practice is to bring nonjudgmental awareness to any and all feelings that arise within the body. In the rush of everyday life, we may ignore or dismiss these internal signals; if they do come to our notice, we may react with impatience or self-criticism. The body scan trains us to observe such sensations with interest and equanimity.</p>
    
    <p> But tuning in to these feelings is only a first step.
The next step is to name them. Attaching a label to our interoceptive sensations allows us to begin to regulate them; without such attentive self-regulation, we may find our feelings overwhelming, or we may misinterpret their source.
Research shows that the simple act of giving a name to what we’re feeling has a profound effect on the nervous system, immediately dialing down the body’s stress response.</p>
    
    <p>
In an experiment conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, study subjects were required to give a series of impromptu speeches in front of an audience (a reliable way to induce anxiety). Half of the participants were then asked to engage in what the researchers call “affect labeling,” filling in responses to the prompt “I feel _________,” while the other half were asked to complete a neutral shape-matching task. The affect-labeling group showed steep declines in heart rate and skin conductance compared to the control group,
whose levels of physiological arousal remained high. Brain-scanning studies offer further evidence of the calming effect of affect labeling: simply naming what is felt reduces activity in the amygdala, the brain structure involved in processing fear and other strong emotions.</p>
    
    <p> Meanwhile, thinking in a more involved way about feelings and the experiences that evoked them actually produces greater activity in the amygdala.
The practice of affect labeling, like the body scan, is a kind of mental training intended to get us into the habit of noting and naming the sensations that arise in our bodies. Psychologists recommend keeping two things in mind as we try it out. The first is to be as prolific as possible: the UCLA scientists reported that study participants who came up with a larger number of terms for what they were feeling subsequently experienced a greater reduction in their physiological arousal.</p>
    
    <p> The second is to be as granular as possible: that is, to choose words that are precise and specific when describing what we feel. Accurately distinguishing among interoceptive sensations is associated with making sounder decisions,
acting less impulsively, and planning ahead more successfully—perhaps because it gives us a clearer sense of what we need and what we want.
Sensing and labeling our internal sensations allows them to function more efficiently as our somatic rudder, steering a nimble course through the many decisions of our days. But does the body really have anything to contribute to our thinking—to processes we usually regard as taking place solely in our heads? It does.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, recent research suggests a rather astonishing possibility:
the body can be more rational than the brain. Recall that, in the study conducted by John Coates, traders with keener interoceptive awareness earned more money: that is, they made more rational choices about buying and selling, as judged by the market, than investors who were less attuned to their bodies.
Outcomes like these may result from the fact that the body is not subject to the cognitive biases that so often distort our conscious thought—the glitches that appear to be hardwired into the human brain.
Take, for example, our stubborn tendency to insist on notions of fairness, even at the cost of spiting ourselves.</p>
