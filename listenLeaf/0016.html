    <p> What happened to spending all day kicking a rock around or catching frogs in the creek? For that matter, what happened to the frogs?7 Fortunately, most of the skills necessary for success as a consumer and wage slave are taught in the institutions of the public school system. It's not the subjects that are taught so much as it's the way they're taught. During children's typical 12-year stint in the public school system, the most "successful" (read well-adjusted) learn not to question authority, not to ask questions which don't pertain to the task at hand, to follow procedure, that trying is better than doing, to be a team player, and not to stand out. Most importantly, children are trained to sit still for increasingly longer time spans while doing mentally menial busywork.</p>
    
    <p> During recess children learn the importance of being well-liked and fitting in--that is, being unique and special within a certain restricted range. These are the essentials for later success on the job. If it wasn't for this behavioral training, the limited subject matter that is actually taught could be accomplished much more quickly. However, imagine what would happen if 12-year-olds with the same intellectual power as high school students, but without the acquired discipline and dulled creativity to sit still and follow boring work procedures for extended periods, suddenly flooded the job market.</p>
    
    <p> Would they even want a job?
The mass education in high schools reflects the mass production of the real world. The teaching style has one teacher (supervisor) lecturing (leading) 20-25 students (workers) sitting in rows, much like a manager and his employees. Practically all problems that are presented are closed-form problems where there's only one answer that, by construction, can be found using the methods in the textbook. The subjects taught are selected to be testable, preferably using standardized exams with predefined answers.</p>
    
    <p> This means that most subjects are mechanical rather than organic in nature, in the sense that they have a well-defined problem with an easy, step-by-step method of arriving at a solution, rather than an open-ended problem with nonlinear and complex solutions. There is therefore an advantage to focusing on memorizing the textbook rather than attaining a broader understanding. This is excellent training for intelligently following procedure, but also a powerful counter-training against using intelligence creatively.
The testing structure is fairly simple.</p>
    
    <p> Some chapter in the book will have a paragraph which reads, "There are three known instances of..." while the test will have a question, "Name the three instances of.</p>
    
    <p>.." This is not much different from a job, where there are three kinds of burgers for sale and the cash register has three pictures of burgers (press the correct one), or three kinds of situations with three different forms to fill out one for each.
This kind of education doesn't instill much permanent information, and it doesn't require much deep understanding of the fundamentals.</p>
    
    <p> It doesn't instill knowledge and it certainly doesn't instill wisdom--in that sense, I guess it's much like the news media. What it mostly does is to test the students' intelligence and short-term memorization skills, and their willingness to use these talents to maximize their test scores and grades. It's fortunate that most office jobs don't require much prior knowledge from the job applicant. The procedures for most jobs can be learned by a sufficiently intelligent person with a sufficiently good memory and the conditioning to concentrate on the same task for long hours.</p>
    
    <p> Many employers, however,
don't hire people without the required proof of achievement and conformity--that is, a degree.
Meanwhile, many subjects that could be taught in school are not. It's probably safe to say that adolescent children growing up in a "primitive" tribe understand the world around them by the time they reach adulthood.
They know which plants are safe and which are poisonous.</p>
