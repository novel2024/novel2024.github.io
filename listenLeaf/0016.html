    <p> Studies by other researchers have even suggested that following a meandering, free-form route—as opposed to a fixed and rigid one—may further enhance creative thought processes.
Although contemporary culture prescribes sitting still while thinking, a stroll through the history of literature and philosophy finds ample evidence of a counter-message. Remember Friedrich Nietzsche, from earlier in our journey.
“Only thoughts which come from walking have any value,” he maintained.</p>
    
    <p>
Søren Kierkegaard felt similarly. “I have walked myself into my best thoughts,” remarked the Danish philosopher. Walking is “gymnastics for the mind,” observed the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. “I am unable to reflect when I am not walking; the moment I stop, I think no more, and as soon as I am again in motion, my head resumes its workings,” averred the Swiss-born philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
    
    <p> The French philosopher and essayist Michel de Montaigne lamented that his thoughts often came to him when he was on the move, at moments when “I have nothing to jot them down on”; this was wont to happen “especially on my horse, the seat of my widest musings.” These great thinkers were clearly on to something. We ought to be finding ways to integrate movement into all our daily activities, to tap into the mobile intelligence of “the mind at three miles per hour,” as the contemporary writer Rebecca Solnit has called the mental state induced by walking. This could mean walking on a treadmill as we type at our computers, walking as we talk on the phone, walking as we conduct work meetings—even walking as we attend class.</p>
    
    <p>
Thinking while walking would seem to be a natural fit for the world of academe. A few years ago, philosophy professor Douglas Anderson of the University of North Texas got to wondering why he and his students stayed put in a lecture hall while the texts they studied so often extolled the merits of movement. He began teaching one of his courses, “Philosophy of Self- Cultivation,” while on the move: professor and students walk about the campus as they discuss the week’s assigned reading. Anderson says he has noticed a difference in his students as soon as they leave the room where the class initially assembles: their voices and expressions become more animated, they have more to say, their minds seem to work at a faster clip.</p>
    
    <p>
Included on Anderson’s syllabus is, of course, “Walking,” the essay by philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau first delivered at the Concord Lyceum in 1851. “I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields,” he declared. That same year,
Thoreau expanded on the theme in his journal. “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live!” he exclaimed.</p>
    
    <p> “Methinks that the moment my legs begin to move, my thoughts begin to flow.” 3 Thinking with Gesture GABRIEL HERCULE bounded onto the stage of Startupbootcamp’s 2018 Demo Day wearing a slim gray suit, white shirt, and red tie. Before he said a word, his confidence announced itself in his smooth stride and fluid gestures.
“Two years ago I was hit by a van because the driver’s eyes weren’t on the road,” he began.</p>
    
    <p> Hercule widened his eyes and held out his hands, palms up, as if to say, Can you believe it? “Fortunately, I made it out with only minor scratches, but this left me with a very real sense that something needed to be done about automotive safety—especially in the commercial vehicle sector,
where drivers face huge time pressures.” He spread his arms wide to emphasize the word “huge.” “One of the key lessons we learned”—the fingers of his right hand formed a precise pincer gesture—“in the commercial automotive sector is that the fleet manager is responsible for ensuring that every delivery”—the words were punctuated by two jabs at the air—“is made at the right place at the right time, a task that’s much easier said than done.” Fleet managers, Hercule continued, are nervous: nervous about their drivers getting lost, nervous about road accidents, nervous about packages arriving late.</p>
    
    <p>
“This is why fleet managers wish they could be in the vehicle with their drivers”—he made a downward tucking motion, emphasizing the word “in”—“to teach them better habits. And now they can.” Hercule paused for dramatic effect.
“I’d like to introduce the Atlas One, the very first head-up display that sends driving information directly to the driver through a projected hologram, with three key features to enhance driving behavior.</p>
    
    <p> All this, while keeping the driver’s eyes on the road.” Hercule’s hands were in constant motion as he got to the heart of his pitch: they framed his gaze like a camera’s viewfinder, then Strayer, David, 109–10 stress, nature and, 95 studies (rooms), 118–19 studiolo example, 118–19, 129–30 Stueber, Karsten, 182 subcentral area, 191 subgenual prefrontal cortex, 95 Sullivan, William, 106 Sunstein, Cass, 232 Sutton, Robert, 202–3, 204 switchboard metaphor, 9 symbol pushing, 158 symbolic gestures, 70, 81 symmetry, 136 synchrony, 216–21, 226–28  T tacit knowledge, 209 Taj Mahal, 136 Taylor, Andrea Faber, 96 Taylor, Frederick Winslow, 132 Taylor, Richard, 101–2 teaching and teaching instinct, 195–99.
