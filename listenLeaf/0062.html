    <p> Some develop a social network so large that they can travel anywhere with little cost (look into courier services and couch surfing), and others develop such a wide set of skills along with an ability to sell those skills that they can work for room and board as well as a small stipend.
Conversely, it may be that an activity needs certain other connections.
For example, using the company gym for free requires working for the company. In fact, companies often attempt to strengthen their employees' dependence on the company by providing "benefits" like health care,
retirement plans, and other perks which can be thought of as golden handcuffs.</p>
    
    <p> This must be kept in mind when resolving dependencies,
especially connections to things outside your immediate control.
The optimal solution in terms of dependencies and connections is shown in this figure. Here each project is modularized and acts as a holon.
This means that the connections within the project are strong, whereas the connections between a project and the external world (other projects) are weak.</p>
    
    <p> Consequently, any given project doesn't depend very much on other projects, and vice versa. They are also self-supporting and able to contribute to each other without depending on each other. It is resilient, much like the Internet is resilient by design, as it can still function even when individual servers are down, as no single server is critical. Now, can you say the same thing about your life with regards to your job? Or your car?
This figure shows how to organize your activities.</p>
    
    <p> Much like an industrial conglomerate, dependencies between the projects are weak.
Strong dependencies are contained inside the projects.
Another aspect of this figure is that no single module dominates. The modules are diversified into approximately equally large sizes, which decreases risk.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, consider the university departments in The Renaissance ideal. Each department in a university is about equally large and strong. This is unlike most people where one skill completely dominates all others--for example, one may be paid $25,000/year for one activity (one's job) but less than $25/year for one's next highest source of income, which is very likely to be the interest from a savings account. With proper diversification, if one income-generating module fails, it doesn't cause shockwaves through the rest of the system because the external coupling to other modules is weak.</p>
    
    <p> In addition, if the external couplings connect to different modules, rather than connecting to the same module,
this lack of centralization protects the system from disruptions and cascading failures. Furthermore, the wider the diversification, the greater the likelihood of taking advantage of opportunities in the unique environment you reside in, or which you may find yourself residing in due to changing circumstances--this is the quintessence of adaptability. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't solve a problem, solve another problem--an omnivore always has more options available when solving the problem of eating.
Note that simple, small, and slow modules are easier to manage than complicated, large, and fast modules.</p>
    
    <p> In managing modules, your reaction time should be faster than the characteristic time scale of anything you interact with and you should be able to understand and control anything you engage with/in as well as have the time to oversee the operation. While increasing size and complexity initially offers better benefits, the benefits decrease as increasingly higher costs of unforeseen problems swamp the system. Here the answer is to offload the complexity, but where do you begin and where do you stop? Communities like the Shakers and the Quakers have thought about this and decided on some ground rules of what complexities to avoid. In general, the avoided complexities are the tightly coupled complexities.</p>
    
    <p>42 They will gladly borrow those, but they won't own them. To wit, they use a modularity strategy with loose couplings to avoid many problems.
Slowness can be achieved through delayed gratification. In a world of scarcity, instant gratification is the optimal strategy.</p>
