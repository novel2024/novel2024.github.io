(Students who try to study while listening to high-intensity music like hip hop,
one researcher found, are subject to what he memorably called the “attention drainage effect.”) Music disrupts cognition for young people just as much as it does for adults. Perhaps most regrettably, people’s intellectual performance while listening to music they prefer is “significantly poorer” than when listening to music they dislike.
What’s true for our sense of hearing holds for vision as well.</p>
    
    <p> We can’t choose not to see what enters our field of vision; it is nearly impossible to prevent our gaze from darting toward a visual stimulus that is new or in motion. And just as our ears prick up at the sound of people’s speech, our eyes are drawn toward the human visage. The brain automatically prioritizes the processing of faces, even when we’re trying hard to focus on a page or a screen. Our attention is pulled especially powerfully to the gaze of other people; we are uncannily sensitive to the feeling of being observed.</p>
    
    <p> Once we spot others’ eyes on us, the processing of eye contact takes precedence over whatever else our brains were working on. An awareness of being looked at even increases our physiological arousal, as revealed by a spike in skin conductance. (Recall that when our nervous system becomes aroused, we start to perspire in a barely perceptible way. This slight sheen of sweat momentarily turns our skin into a better conductor of electricity.</p>
    
    <p>) When we glimpse a face in which the eyes are closed or directed elsewhere, we register no change in skin conductance—but that same measure shows a jolt whenever we see eyes looking our way.
All this visual monitoring and processing uses up considerable mental resources, leaving that much less brainpower for our work. We know this because of how much better we think when we close our eyes. Eye closure “helps people to disengage from environmental stimulation and thereby enhances the efficiency of cognitive processing,” one team of researchers reports.</p>
    
    <p> Temporarily relieved of such stimulation, people experience less cognitive load, are better able to engage in visualization, and can more readily retrieve elusive information when faced with one of those frustrating “tip-of-the- tongue” moments. They’re also much better at recalling details, both visual and auditory. One study reported a 23 percent increase in correct answers when participants closed their eyes as they answered questions about a film they had just watched.
Of course, we can hardly go about our work or our learning with our eyes closed.</p>
    
    <p> We have to rely on elements of physical space to save us from our own propensity for distraction—to impose the “sensory reduction” that supports optimal attention, memory, and cognition. “Good fences make good neighbors,” wrote poet Robert Frost; likewise, good walls make good collaborators.
 WALLS, AND the protected spaces they create, shield us from distraction. But they do more: they also provide us with privacy, a state that bears a surprising relationship to creativity.</p>

The open-plan coffeehouse model now enjoying such popularity is performance oriented, almost exhibitionist in nature; think of Benjamin Franklin and his fellow debaters holding forth at the coffeehouse near St. Paul’s. But putting oneself on display consumes mental resources, leaving less brainpower for the work itself. (The act of self-presentation may be particularly draining for members of certain groups.</p>
    
    <p> One recent study, conducted in a British government agency that switched from enclosed offices to an open-plan workspace, found that the heightened imperative to engage in self-presentation in such settings fell most heavily on women, for whom appearance is considered especially important.) When people are relieved of the cognitive load imposed by their environment,
they immediately become more creative, neuroscientist Moshe Bar has found.
Bar, who directs the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, reports that when he taxed subjects’ mental resources as they completed a test of creative thinking, they came up with more “statistically common” (that is, conventional and commonplace) associations. In his study,
Bar found that “a high mental load consistently diminished the originality and creativity” of his subjects’ responses.</p>
