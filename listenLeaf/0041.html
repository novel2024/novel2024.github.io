Gestures are also particularly well suited to conveying spatial concepts.
Professional geologists, for example, employ a range of specialized gestures to think and communicate about the way terrestrial layers bend, fold, and shift in space. When they refer to “subduction”—the sideways and downward movement of a plate of the earth’s crust beneath another plate—they slide one hand across and under the other. When they invoke “angular unconformity”— rock strata that lie flat on top of other strata that are “beveled,” or uneven—they hold one hand steady above the other hand which tilts side to side.</p>
    
    <p> Though these experts surely have the words to express their meaning, still they rely on their hands to do much of the work.
Students learning about geology for the first time can also benefit from using gesture. Kinnari Atit, an assistant professor of education at the University of California, Riverside, asked two groups of college students to explain how they would use Play-Doh to create three-dimensional models of geological features.
The members of one group were permitted to use their hands to gesture; those in the second group were asked to employ only words.</p>
    
    <p> Before and after the exercise, both groups were tested on their ability to engage in what experts call “penetrative thinking.” This is the capacity to visualize and reason about the interior of a three-dimensional object from what can be seen on its surface—a critical skill in geology, and one with which many students struggle. Study participants who gestured got significantly higher scores the second time they were tested on a measure of penetrative thinking, while participants who only explained verbally showed no improvement.
Such results suggest that the act of gesturing doesn’t just help communicate spatial concepts to others; it also helps the gesturer herself understand the concepts more fully.</p>
    
    <p> Indeed, without gesture as an aid, students may fail to understand spatial ideas at all. “Strike and dip” is a basic geological concept that describes a rock layer’s rotation from north (strike) and a rock layer’s rotation from horizontal (dip). After reading a textbook-style introduction to the concept,
“many college students made dramatic errors in recording an outcrop’s strike and dip on a campus map,” noted a team of researchers from Penn State. Better performance on this task, they found, was linked to greater use of gesture by the students.</p>

For learners endeavoring to grasp spatial concepts, “language can actually get in the way,” says Michele Cooke, a professor of geoscience at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Cooke, who is hearing-impaired, has spent years leading outreach programs that engage deaf students in the study of geologic fault systems. She has noticed that these students are especially quick to master geological concepts and theories, a deftness she attributes to the skills of observation and spatial cognition they have developed as users of American Sign Language (ASL). People who are fluent in sign language, as Cooke is, have been found to have an enhanced ability to process visual and spatial information.</p>
    
    <p> Such superior performance is exhibited by hearing people who know sign language, as well as by the hearing impaired—suggesting that it is the repeated use of a structured system of meaning-bearing gestures that helps improve spatial thinking.
Cooke often employs a modified form of sign language with her (hearing) students at UMass. By using her hands, Cooke finds, she can accurately capture the three-dimensional nature of the phenomena she’s explaining. She can efficiently direct her students’ attention to particular features she wants to highlight.</p>
    
    <p> And she can divide the river of information she’s presenting into two smaller streams, one verbal and one visual, thereby reducing her students’ cognitive load—often heavy when novices are learning new ideas and vocabulary terms at the same time. Cooke asks the undergraduates enrolled in her courses to imitate her “ASL-based gestures” as they are introduced to new geological concepts, and encourages her students to use the hand motions when talking with one another in discussion groups. In Cooke’s class, the single- minded focus on written and spoken language that characterizes so much university teaching and learning has been nudged aside, making room for the intuitive genius of gesture.
 WE CAN DO the same, elevating gesture above its current status as a dismissed or disparaged adjunct to speech.</p>
    
    <p> A good place to start: making more gestures ourselves. Research shows that moving our hands advances our understanding of abstract or complex concepts, reduces our cognitive load, and improves our memory. Making gestures also helps us get our message across to others with more persuasive force. Studies demonstrate that hearing speech and seeing gesture at the same time evoke a stronger reaction from the brains of those listening and watching than does speech or movement on its own.</p>
