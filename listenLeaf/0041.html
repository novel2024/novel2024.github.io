    <p> Subsequently, perennial weeds, shrubs, and small trees like aspen or pine take over in competition for resources like sunlight. Larger trees, like oak and elm, subsequently block the sunlight for the shorter trees, which die out, and thus the habitat finally reaches what is known as a climax stage or community, which is stable, barring any disruptions such as forest fires or lava flows, which restart the cycle.
For an example of succession that is easier to relate to for a "civilized" person, consider how cookie-cutter housing developments easily populate undeveloped land, like weed seeds. These dwellings are unable to survive without cars forming long roots back to shopping centers in the city.</p>
    
    <p> As suburbia takes hold, strip malls appear closer to the development. These draw in more people, which increases the price of land and makes closer- spaced, but higher-quality homes more economical. This in turn attracts small general shops, eventually forming a shopping street or downtown area. Sidewalks appear, followed by multi-story buildings in the city center.</p>
    
    <p>
As the succession proceeds, old species like cars and sprawl are eliminated,
eventually leading to the climax community of a city.
The same thing occurs in the world of ideas. A group of people or a single person get a bright idea which is completely different from all other ideas. If the idea has merit, other people pick up the idea and create their own personal variations on the idea, perhaps giving different names to the same object, or perhaps using different methods to arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
    
    <p> These people compete for dominance of their ideas, eventually reaching a point where only a handful of different methods are used. The next generation uses those methods to discover new details, but they don't compete on methodology, and hence it remains static. As the intellectual field matures, the rate at which details are discovered increases. As competition grows more intense, the scope of discovery narrows,
specialization increases, and politics becomes increasingly more important,
as happens in any complex society where resources--in this case, the number of remaining discoveries to be made--are no longer abundant.</p>
    
    <p> The idea has reached its climax stage a point where no new understanding occurs; just increasingly smaller adjustments of the details.
Some observations:
Each "species" is adapted to thrive in a very specific environment.
If the conditions change, the existing species will be outcompeted by a species which is better adapted to the new conditions.
Succession occurs because the dominance of one species gradually changes the environment.</p>
    
    <p>
These are the most important observations. Keep in mind that one species may be dependent on other species or live together with other species in communities. A community is known as a seral stage. Seral stages merge gradually into each other until they reach the climax stage.</p>
    
    <p>
The climax stage is stable, but may change due to external or internal disruptive events (lava flows, the invention of the steam engine).
Ergodicity and destiny It is possible to change "species." Regardless of the initial state or large bumps along the way, people gravitate toward the outcomes their behavior induces. As "species" have different types of behavior, one must change behavior to change species.</p>
    
    <p> There's no faking it, nor is there any "buying" it. People do not change due to a single clever idea; they are what they are based on the totality of their behavior.
In other words, luck is only important in the short term. In the long term, luck has little to do with success.</p>
