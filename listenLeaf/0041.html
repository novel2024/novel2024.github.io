    <p> While he was able to achieve a legacy that many men of his time did not, Napoleon carried with him the psychological scars of his past. It is believed that Napoleon lashed out and acted aggressively to make up for his shortcomings. Which shortcomings,
you might wonder.
For starters, Napoleon was shorter than the average man.</p>
    
    <p> Standing at five feet and two inches, it is easy to see why Napoleon may have been insecure about his height. His stature notwithstanding, Napoleon believed that he was something special and even wrote about it in his book aptly named Thoughts. In the book, Napoleon talks about how he had come to believe that he was special and could go forth to achieve things that he had only previously believed to be fantasy.
At the end of the day, it’s probably unfair to fault Napoleon for turning to narcissism to cheer himself up.</p>
    
    <p> He was probably only trying to make up for the feelings of inadequacy that he had grown to be familiar with thanks to his childhood taunts from his classmates and schoolmates.
 Adolf Hitler Who is the most self-absorbed person that you currently know of? Take that person’s thoughts, behaviors, and actions and then multiply them one million times. What do you get? Adolf Hitler, that’s what. Adolf Hitler lived in the early 1900s so he must have done some pretty bad things to be still talked about today.</p>
    
    <p> And indeed, he did.
Not only did Adolf believe that his race was better than everyone else, but he also had to get everyone else on the propaganda machine too. As a result,
millions of Jews lost their lives thanks to the calculations and machinations of one man whose narcissism and thirst for power got out of hand. Hitler’s leadership style was structured such that he was at the top, and nobody else could question him.</p>
    
    <p> His inferiors were to take these commands unquestioningly because he believed he knew better than everyone else.
While his generals were killing the Jews left, right and center, Hitler had no empathy for those dying and suffering. In fact, he wanted this murder spree to continue for as long as it could, or at least until he was able to wipe out the inferior race.
Hitler will forever be remembered as the reason for one of the biggest wars ever witnessed on earth, and all because he believed that he and white Germans were superior to everybody else.</p>

Charles Manson Charles Manson is one of the most well-known cult leaders of modern American history. Manson was an unemployed ex-convict who utilized psychopathic manipulation to create himself a following which he named the Manson Family. Manson had an ability to convince young people to join his family by preying on their weaknesses and making them feel as if he was their safe place and messiah. After drawing them in, Manson then convinced them to commit crimes on his behalf.</p>
    
    <p> In the summer of 1969, for instance,
Manson’s Family killed nine people on his command.
Even after being arrested, Manson showed no remorse or guilt for the suffering he had inflicted on others. He had a disregard for humanity that can only be described as callous.
That being said, Manson was also highly charming, and this caused people to gravitate towards him.</p>
    
    <p> Even while in prison, Manson was still able to use his psychopathic charm to lure women, even to the point of getting engaged to one.
Albert DeSalvo Nicknamed The Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo was a criminal who confessed to killing thirteen women in the Boston area, by way of strangulation. DeSalvo was a typical psychopath. Right from childhood, he exhibited the signs of a psychopath.</p>
