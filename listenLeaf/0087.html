    <p> Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has invested in research on just such “one-shot imitation learning.” But, as University of California, Berkeley, psychologist Alison Gopnik notes,
the most sophisticated forms of artificial intelligence “are still far from being able to solve problems that human four-year-olds accomplish with ease.” While it was once regarded as a low-level, “primitive” instinct, researchers are coming to recognize that imitation—at least as practiced by humans, including very young ones—is a complex and sophisticated capacity. Although non-human animals do imitate, their mimicry differs in important ways from ours.</p>
    
    <p> For example, young humans’ copying is unique in that children are quite selective about whom they choose to imitate. Even preschoolers prefer to imitate people who have shown themselves to be knowledgeable and competent. Research shows that while toddlers will choose to copy their mothers rather than a person they’ve just met, as children grow older they become increasingly willing to copy a stranger if the stranger appears to have special expertise. By the time a child reaches age seven, Mom no longer knows best.</p>
    
    <p>
At the same time, children are strikingly unselective about what they imitate —another way in which our practice of imitation departs from that of animals.
Humans are “high-fidelity” copiers: our young imitate adults to the letter, while other animals will make do with a slapdash approximation. This difference can make apes, monkeys, and even dogs look like the smarter species. Shown a procedure with an extra, unnecessary step—like touching a box with one’s forehead before prying it open and retrieving the treat inside—chimps and canines will skip the superfluous move to go right for the goods.</p>
    
    <p> Children,
however, will faithfully imitate every step.
There is sense behind this seemingly irrational behavior. Humans’ tendency to “overimitate”—to reproduce even the gratuitous elements of another’s behavior —may operate on a copy now, understand later basis. After all, there might be good reasons for such steps that the novice does not yet grasp, especially since so many human tools and practices are “cognitively opaque”: not self- explanatory on their face.</p>
    
    <p> Even if there doesn’t turn out to be a functional rationale for the actions taken, imitating the customs of one’s culture is a smart move for a highly social species like our own. Indeed, researchers have demonstrated that a four-year-old child is more likely to overimitate than a two- year-old, indicating a growing sensitivity to social cues. Our tendency to engage in overimitation continues to increase across development, all the way into adulthood. Because so much of human culture is arbitrary in form—why do we clap at the end of a performance, or eat cake at birthday parties, or wear wedding rings on the fourth finger of the left hand?—it depends on imitation for its perpetuation.</p>
    
    <p> Imitation is at the root of our social and cultural life; it is, quite literally, what makes us human.
There is evidence that we are born with a predisposition to imitate. Several decades ago, University of Washington psychologist Andrew Meltzoff showed that babies who were days or even hours old responded to his opening his mouth or sticking out his tongue by forming the same facial expressions in return. At the same time, the capacity to imitate, and to learn from observation, can be nurtured: in some present-day cultures, it is cultivated quite deliberately, with impressive results.</p>
    
    <p> In studies comparing European American children with Mayan children from Guatemala, psychologists Maricela Correa-Chávez and Barbara Rogoff asked children from each culture to wait while an adult performed a demonstration—folding an origami shape—for another child nearby. The Mayan youth paid far more sustained attention to the demonstration —and therefore learned more—than the American kids, who were often distracted or inattentive. Correa-Chávez and Rogoff note that in Mayan homes,
children are encouraged to carefully observe older family members so that they can learn how to carry out the tasks of the household, even at very young ages.
Because our own culture discourages imitation, American children aren’t granted similar opportunities to show how competent they can be; they also lack exposure to inspiring examples, or “models,” of the kind of work that kids their age are capable of producing.</p>
    
    <p> For decades, educator Ron Berger towed around a rolling suitcase filled with hundreds of such models: sketches, poems, and essays created by children, which he would pull out and share with teachers and students at schools around the country. Among his favorite examples is a picture he calls “Austin’s Butterfly,” drawn by a first-grader in Boise, Idaho. When he displays the drawing—which depicts a tiger swallowtail butterfly in graceful detail—students often murmur in awe. Berger’s aim is to inspire his audience with examples of excellent work by their peers, but also to demonstrate to them how such work is made.</p>
