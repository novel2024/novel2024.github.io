When this is not possible, like with electronics (unless you're an electrical engineer, or have the equivalent knowledge, for example, by becoming competent in amateur radio), I prefer things with replaceable components.
If one part fails, it can be replaced to preserve the integrity of the system.
Replacing parts corresponds to the technician level. Anyone can replace parts.</p>
    
    <p> The mechanic level is knowing which part to replace without trying to replace parts at random until it works. To truly master your stuff, it's worthwhile to try to build some of it yourself. This doesn't mean you should build your own TV, but you could build your own composting system or furniture. Later you can build your own radio.</p>
    
    <p> There is a great deal of satisfaction in doing this. Furthermore, disposal becomes easier because knowing how to put things together typically means knowing how to take them apart. It also means that it's easier to select, tweak, and even create designs that are more appropriate for a particular purpose.
In general, I only trust things as far as I can throw them, but that's just me.</p>
    
    <p> More importantly, I don't trust things I can't see, like wall conduits. In general, I don't trust things that have been "abstracted" away behind a clever user interface. What this does is merely to insert another layer of experts between the things and the users, allowing the latter to become "lusers." There are two kinds of people:
1.</p>
    
    <p> If something breaks, they call a repair guy or throw it out and buy something new.
2. If something breaks, they are the repair guy and fix it.
If you're the latter type, you're the master of your stuff.</p>

How to avoid getting things It is very likely that you already have very many things; I know I did.
The most important thing, therefore, is to avoid getting more things and compounding the problem. Realize that the strong desire to acquire new things can be replaced with an equally strong desire to avoid acquiring new things. This transition will take a few months to become habitually ingrained.</p>

The wish list method seems to be widely known. It's trivially easy to use and I have been using it for a long time, first with actual pen and paper,
later just mentally. Here's how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. Don't buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days.</p>
    
    <p> You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it.
Test yourself. Books used to be my favorite consumer item. I read several books a week.</p>
