brain to handle.
At first, Hutchins observed, Richards reached for ways to spread the burden of the task across his own body and across the tools he had at hand. He “subvocally rehearsed” the numbers he was computing, repeating the digits under his breath —using his voice and his auditory sense to expand the capacity of his working memory. He traced the columns of numbers being added with his fingertip, using his hand to help keep track of the masses of information he was managing.</p>
    
    <p> With a pencil, he jotted down intermediate sums in the margin of the navigation chart,
fixing in place a kind of “external memory,” in Hutchins’s phrase. And he pulled out a calculator, using it to relieve his brain of the burden of carrying out mathematical operations. Still, laboring on his own, Richards began to fall behind. He recruited yet one more resource: the mental ability of his teammate,
Quartermaster Second Class Silver.</p>
    
    <p> The addition of another mind created a new challenge, however: how to figure out, on the fly, the best way to divide up the complex and fast-paced task.
All the while, the ship kept moving, and now a new emergency arose: the Palau was bearing down on a sailboat, a small craft whose occupants were oblivious to the bigger ship’s dire condition.
“Normally the Palau would have sounded five blasts with its enormous horn,” Hutchins noted. But the Palau’s whistle was a steam whistle, and without steam pressure it was mute.</p>
    
    <p> Onboard the ship was a small manual foghorn, “basically a bicycle pump with a reed and a bell,” in Hutchins’s description. A junior officer —the keeper of the deck log—was sent running to find the foghorn, take it out to the bow, and let it sound. Meanwhile, the captain gripped the microphone for the flight deck’s public-address system and spoke into it: “Sailboat crossing Palau’s bow, be advised that I have no power. You cross at your own risk.</p>
    
    <p> I have no power.” By this time, the sailboat had disappeared under the Palau’s bow; only the tip of its sail was visible from the pilothouse. The crew braced for the impending collision. The keeper of the deck log reached the bow at last and let out five feeble honks, surely too late to do any good.</p>
    
    <p> But a few seconds later, the sailboat emerged, still sailing, from under the starboard bow—one casualty, at least,
averted.
Back inside the pilothouse, Richards and Silver were still huddled over the chart table, struggling to apportion the task between them. According to Hutchins’s scrupulous observations, the pair made thirty-two attempts before “a consistent pattern of action appeared” and an effective division of labor between the two men was established. On try thirty-three, he noted, “they perform what will be the stable configuration for the first time.</p>
    
    <p>” Once this configuration was in place, the teammates settled into a rhythm,
taking in new bearing data and churning out new position calculations. With their coordinated efforts, and those of the rest of the crew, the huge ship was guided to safety. “Twenty-five minutes after the engineering casualty and more than two miles from where the wild ride had begun, the Palau was brought to anchor at the intended location in ample water just outside the bounds of the navigation channel,” Hutchins reported.
“The safe arrival of the Palau at anchor was due in large part to the exceptional seamanship of the bridge crew,” he continued.</p>
    
    <p> “But no single individual in the bridge acting alone—neither the captain nor the navigator nor the quartermaster chief supervising the navigation team—could have kept control of the ship and brought it safely to anchor.” A psychologist on the lookout for “socially distributed cognition” could hardly have chanced upon a better example. Too often, however, we’re not alert to such instances of collective thought. Our culture and our institutions tend to fixate on the individual—on his uniqueness, his distinctiveness, his independence from others.</p>
