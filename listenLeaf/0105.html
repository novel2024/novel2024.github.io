    <p> Combining plants with animals that will eat whatever humans don't eat and provide fertilizer that humans don't provide either will cap the waste. Unfortunately, zoning laws prohibit such farming in most urban settings. However, there's a growing trend of urban farmers that push these laws to the limit under a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. For instance, you could keep (meat) rabbits in your basement, and no, they won't smell if you clean the pens.</p>
    
    <p> If you can keep animals above ground,
have your chicken eat some of the red wiggler worms you use for speedy composting of your green waste. If you can't have chicken, at least get a fishing license and use your surplus worms or share them with others. There are always people who are into vermicomposting. All it takes to build a vermicomposter are two buckets and a drill.</p>

If you can't get access to land, and indoor hydroponics is too far- fetched, you could join a CSA (community-supported agriculture). Buying into a CSA seems rather expensive, though, and it may be cheaper to arrange your own "community" by asking friends if you can use some of their unused land to plant something. Many will be happy to let you pluck their oranges or apples to keep their lawn free of obstacles. Some engage in guerrilla gardening.</p>

You can find many books describing how to grow your own food,
whether it's on a farm, a small homestead or even your balcony. In my opinion, at present price levels, growing your own food isn't going to save you much if any money. At future price levels, it most likely will.
Furthermore, having insourced some of your own food supply, you'll be more resilient.</p>
    
    <p> Besides, gardening can be a very satisfying pastime as you literally get to eat the fruits of your labor, something which is rarely the case in a "real" job.
Lights and electric First, quit the wasteful habit of leaving the lights on everywhere.
Leaving a room for more than one minute means turning the lights off. In particular it means turning off minor appliances like TVs, radios, and computers.</p>
    
    <p> If no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Yes, it does!
Next, reconsider whether the amount of lighting is appropriate. I've seen close to 800W being used to light a living room, which is clearly unnecessary. Replace the 100W light bulbs in big chandeliers with smaller light bulbs. Some well-designed lamps are much better at diffusing the light and directing it downwards.</p>
    
    <p> In general, move the light source close to where it is needed. These measures will help more than switching the house to CFLs and keeping your bad habits.
Extreme measures involve making sure that your devices are truly switched off. Many modern off switches just put the device in standby mode.</p>
    
    <p> If you're handy with a soldering iron and understand electronics, you can install your own off switch at the DC side of the power supply. Or you can simply pull the plug out.
I wouldn't recommend going out and buying energy-efficient appliances without doing a detailed analysis of current cost of electricity versus future cost of electricity + cost of appliance. It's quite likely that it won't be worthwhile.</p>
