    <p> Don't think that the only way to live is in a house in suburbia or an apartment in the city.
Eating The need for a kitchen and its particular configuration is determined by diet. Even the need for particular kitchen appliances is determined by diet.
Eating a mostly or exclusively raw diet eliminates the range oven and replaces it with a blender and a juicer.</p>
    
    <p> The need for a refrigerator is determined by your location. If you live close to a supermarket, you can simply store your food at the market rather than in your refrigerator. On the other hand, the more inconvenient your location is, the larger the refrigerator you need. In other words, if you were a serious health nut, you could completely replace your kitchen with a blender.</p>
    
    <p> If you desire some variation, simply eat somewhere else once in a while. If you desire some warm food for a change, bring out the camping stove. There's no need to own a range unless you use it every day. You may even be lucky enough that your company offers a lunch buffet.</p>
    
    <p> Make lunch your main meal and have a sandwich for dinner; no kitchen needed.
Hygiene With a little planning and consideration, all families will do just fine with one bathroom. Multiple bathrooms only make sense if you're housing an entire football team for some reason. Unless you fancy playing with composting toilets, humanure, and building your own thunder box, toilets all work the same.</p>
    
    <p> Showering may very well be accomplished off-site, for example, in a gym. A blog reader informed me that he used an off-site toilet for half a year, walking 1.5 miles each way. Showers can range from a bucket over a solar shower to more elaborate arrangements.</p>
    
    <p> Also, there's no rule that says that showering must happen in the morning right after getting out of bed.
Living with other people Minimal use of certain facilities calls for their sharing with other people. The easiest way to share is to live with others, or at least next to them. Recently the trend has been the exact opposite, with more and more people living by themselves and building rooms that provide utility just for them, like home theaters, rec rooms, bars, etc.</p>
    
    <p> Sharing things as in dorms,
communes, or families represents enormous savings. If you're a student it's tempting to move from home, as I did, but there are many savings to be had by staying at home, both for you and your parents. You will also reduce the work associated with cooking, laundry, etc. Consider that resources are being wasted whenever an asset is lying dormant.</p>
    
    <p> Spending 8-10 hours out of the home, eight hours sleeping, and a few hours doing "other" leaves very few hours for using the "home." As such spending a lot of money on one's home makes little sense since one's "effective place of being" is actually one's job or office. The fewer the users of a given room, the more resources are wasted. Some rooms in many homes are used very rarely,
such as the bathroom and the kitchen, both rooms on which it has become popular to spend a lot of money, ironically.</p>
