    <p> Yet we expect students and employees to attend to information that’s been drained of conflict, blandly presented as the established account or consensus view. In fact, almost every topic can be cast in terms that highlight opposing perspectives—and should be, according to David Johnson, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota. It is “a general rule of teaching,” he has written, “that if an instructor does not create an intellectual conflict within the first few minutes of class, students won’t engage with the lesson.” Johnson has spent decades investigating the uses of what he calls “constructive controversy,” or the open-minded exploration of diverging ideas and beliefs.</p>
    
    <p> In his studies, Johnson has found that students who are drawn into an intellectual dispute read more library books, review more classroom materials, and seek out more information from others in the know. Conflict creates uncertainty—who’s wrong? who’s right?—an ambiguity that we feel compelled to resolve by acquiring more facts.
Intellectual clashes can also generate what psychologists call “the accountability effect.” Just as students prepare more assiduously when they know they’ll be teaching the material to others, people who know they’ll be called upon to defend their views marshal stronger points, and support them with more and better evidence, than people who anticipate merely presenting their opinions in writing.</p>
    
    <p> Once the debate has begun, the act of arguing enhances thinking in an additional way: it relieves cognitive load by effectively distributing intellectual positions among the disputants. While an individual reasoning alone must keep in mind the details of each claim she contemplates,
the person who argues with others can divide that task among her fellow debaters, allowing each person to stand in for a particular point of view.
Relieved of the burden of carrying on a debate inside her own head, she has more mental resources to devote to evaluating the arguments on their merits.
The ability to argue emerges early in life, as any parent knows.</p>
    
    <p> Children as young as two or three are capable of producing justifications and constructing arguments when they find themselves at odds with their parents or siblings. “As they acquire more language, cognitive skills, and social knowledge about rules and rights,” children become increasingly effective advocates for their own points of view, notes Nancy Stein, a psychologist at the University of Chicago who studies the development of argumentative thinking. The ability to critically evaluate others’ arguments—to distinguish strong claims from weak ones—also emerges early in childhood.
We are “natural-born arguers,” in Hugo Mercier’s phrase—and we can deliberately deploy that innate capacity to correct our mistakes, clarify our thinking, and reach sounder decisions.</p>
    
    <p> The key is to approach the act of arguing with the aim not of winning at all costs but of reaching the truth through a vigorous process of advancing claims and evaluating counter-claims. We use argument to its full advantage when we make the best case for our own position while granting the points lodged against it; when we energetically critique our partner’s position while remaining open to its potential virtues. According to Robert Sutton, the Stanford business school professor, we should endeavor to offer “strong opinions, weakly held”; put another way, he says, “People should fight as if they are right, and listen as if they are wrong.” Listening—and telling—is at the heart of one more way we can use social interaction to enhance our thinking: through the exchange of stories.</p>

 ALL OF THE seventh- and eighth-grade students enrolled in a 2012 study of educational methods were learning about the science of radioactive elements.
The manner in which they encountered the subject, however, was strikingly different. One group was given an account written in the soporifically dull style of a textbook: “Elements are individual pieces of matter that combine with each other and make up everything we see around us. Most of what we see and use in the world, like air and water, is not made up of one single element.</p>
    
    <p> For example,
sodium and chlorine are two different elements that make up the salt that we use for cooking . . .”—and on it droned, adding, “We now know of 92 elements that are a natural part of the Earth.</p>
    
    <p>” A second group of students learned the same material, but with a twist. Their version of the account picked up the thread this way: “By the late 1800s,
scientists had already found most of these elements, but some were yet to be scientists had already found most of these elements, but some were yet to be discovered. At this time, Polish-born Marie Curie and her French husband,
Pierre, were two chemists living in France, trying to find all of Earth’s natural elements. Although it was very hard detective work, Marie and Pierre loved solving the mysteries of elements.</p>
