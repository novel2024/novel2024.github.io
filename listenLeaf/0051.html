Research on the effects of fractals on the human psyche was pioneered by Richard Taylor, a professor of physics, psychology, and art at the University of Oregon. As his title suggests, Taylor has a dizzyingly broad range of interests. A number of years ago, he was studying the fractal patterns present in the flow of electricity when the forms he saw reminded him of something: Jackson Pollock’s paintings. Pursuing this unexpected connection, Taylor analyzed a group of Pollock’s later works and determined that they too exhibited a fractal pattern, with a value in the mid-range of 1.</p>
    
    <p>3 to 1.5. Astonishingly, Pollock’s drip paintings—the ones he made after moving from New York City to Springs,
Long Island—turn out to bear the visual signature of nature. Like Capability Brown and Humphry Repton, the landscape architects who unconsciously re- created the characteristic features of the East African savanna, Pollock seems to have tapped into humanity’s ancient affinity for the natural world.</p>
    
    <p>
Take, for example, a drip painting Pollock completed in 1948, known only as Number 14. Rendered in stark black, white, and gray, the artwork bears no immediate resemblance to the verdant vegetation that surrounded the home he shared with Lee Krasner in Springs. A longer look at the painting, however,
draws the viewer deeper into its swoops and whorls, its intricate nest of thinning and thickening lines. Says Richard Taylor admiringly, “If someone asked, ‘Can I have nature put onto a piece of canvas?,’ the best example there has ever been of that is 1948’s Number 14.</p>
    
    <p>”  TIME SPENT IN NATURE relieves stress, restores mental equilibrium, and enhances the ability to focus and sustain attention. We spend most of our time indoors,
however—so might we find ways to make inside more like outside?
Environmental psychologist Roger Ulrich has asked this question, and answered it in the affirmative, regarding a particular kind of built setting: hospitals and other health care facilities. Our ancient biological wiring allows us to “exploit nature like a drug,” says Ulrich, now a professor of architecture at Chalmers University in Sweden, and he means this almost literally. Several decades ago,
he demonstrated that exposure to nature relieved pain and promoted healing in patients recovering from surgery.</p>
    
    <p>
Ulrich’s study, carried out at a hospital in suburban Philadelphia, found that patients who occupied rooms with a view of trees required fewer painkillers,
experienced fewer complications, and had shorter hospital stays than patients whose rooms looked out on a brick wall. Nurses also recorded many fewer negative notes about patients’ state of mind—“upset and crying,” “needs much encouragement”—for those individuals who had a view of greenery. (Ulrich recounts that the inspiration for the study emerged from his own long-ago experience: “As a teenager, I had some serious illnesses that forced me to spend time at home in bed,” he says. “My window was my compass of stability.</p>
    
    <p> Every day, I watched the trees in the wind. There was something endlessly calming about it.”) Further research by Ulrich and other scientists has confirmed that exposure to natural elements helps diminish patients’ pain and hasten their recovery. This work helped inspire a revolution in the design of health care facilities, leading to the renovation and construction of buildings that provide patients and staff with natural light and views of greenery.</p>
    
    <p> It also led to a raft of research that has sought to identify more precisely the effects of the out-of-doors on our bodies.
This work has established that nature is indeed a highly reliable and effective “drug,” bioengineered by evolution over thousands of years. It appears to affect us all in the same fashion: within twenty to sixty seconds of exposure to nature,
our heart rate slows, our blood pressure drops, our breathing becomes more regular, and our brain activity becomes more relaxed. Even our eye movements change: We gaze longer at natural scenes than at built ones, shifting our focus less frequently.</p>
    
    <p> We blink less often when viewing nature than when looking at urban settings, indicating that nature imposes a less burdensome cognitive load.
We remember details of natural scenes more accurately, and brain scans show that a larger portion of the visual cortex is activated when we look at nature,
along with a larger number of the brain’s pleasure receptors.
Of course, it’s not only hospital patients who can benefit from regular doses of this “drug.” Our homes, schools, and workplaces could all become more cognitively congenial spaces if they were to incorporate elements of what is known as biophilic design.</p>
