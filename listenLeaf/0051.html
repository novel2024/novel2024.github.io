learn a common trade to be able to barter your skills for other things.
Ecological All systems possess ecological knowledge intuitively through evolutionary means. Being part of an ecological system, humans used to possess this knowledge as well. However, technology has created an aberrated bubble, screening people from this knowledge.</p>
    
    <p> Most people are therefore no longer capable of thinking in ecological terms. Indeed, it has resulted in a new kind of system which, like all young systems, is more focused on exponential growth, production, expansion, and quantity rather than stability, protection, consolidation, and quality, which are the marks of a mature system.
Unfortunately for the existing mature systems in nature, the rapid expansion of the human bubble is destroying them. Unfortunately for us, we can't exist without them any more than a living person can exist without oxygen or a body can exist without a head.</p>
    
    <p> In this sense, it is actually a conceptual error to define the environment as the rest of the biosphere save humans, and think of ourselves as apart from it, since we can't exist without it.
Aside from the continued existence of humanity, ecological understanding includes many principles about the organization of complex systems which are very useful for living as a Renaissance man. Ecological goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to know the names of five grasses, five birds, five trees, etc.Â local to your area, and be able to recognize them.</p>
    
    <p>
know which food is in season and how much oil, water, and fertilizer it takes to grow/raise the food (out of season, out of location) and how it is sensitive to Liebig's Law of the minimum.
grow and sustain a garden without using pesticides, hybrid seeds,
chemical-based fertilizer, etc. A garden and indeed any system will achieve maximum integrity when it is in balance, and when growth is stable and resilient without ongoing external interference.
promote functional diversity to retain adaptive capacity, to allow evolution to happen when the environment changes.</p>
    
    <p> Adaptive and evolutionary potential should be considered before interfering. Actions always have reactions, and so action is not always a good idea.
always consider the system and understand both the parts and the whole. No parts exist without the whole and the whole doesn't exist without the parts.</p>
    
    <p> Everything is related to everything else, mostly indirectly. Thus, changing one part will change the whole.
recognize multiple bottom lines, flows, and balances in terms of primary,
secondary,
and tertiary consumers,
producers,
and decomposers.
use the maximum power principle (see Appropriate response), which states that systems strive to maximize the rate of useful work--that is,
to not waste energy to its environment.</p>
    
    <p>
understand the concept of characteristic scales in terms of change and the effect of limits on competition and cooperation. Understand the difference between positive feedbacks and negative feedbacks (both are needed) and how linking feedbacks lead to cycles, runaways, or overshoots.
study the structure and principles of different systems to build a collection of models, in order to understand other systems.
The Renaissance education The most important purpose of education isn't getting a degree, nor is it memorizing a collection of facts in order to win on quiz shows.</p>
    
    <p> Education is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. The point of an education is to learn a systematic way of improving those aspects--exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one's life, so that one may live his life to the fullest extent possible. Learning must become a habit (see Ergodicity and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person. This means that learning never stops.</p>
