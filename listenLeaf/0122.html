    <p> For example,
someone choosing to eat raw food only, a diet which can fulfill all dietary requirements, wouldn't need a stove but would need a dehydrator (it's easy to build your own), a blender (somewhat trickier), and probably a juicer instead. Such a person's kitchen would look quite different from the norm.
Similarly, someone living close to the supermarket (see How to find shelter) and not storing more than a day's worth of perishables could eliminate the need for a refrigerator. After all, the refrigerator is a recent invention.</p>
    
    <p> The refrigerator could also be eliminated by changing ingredients. Shopping outside the refrigerated section also means avoiding meat and dairy products. Many fruits, vegetables, and tubers store without refrigeration for weeks or even months: Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, onions, garlic,
carrots, winter squash, turnips, apples, oranges, limes and lemons. Others store for days: Bananas, lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, and melons.</p>
    
    <p> Books on boat provisioning are a good source of this information, as are old cookbooks. This doesn't require a complete elimination of meat or ice cream, etc.; it just means only buying what will be eaten that day. All things being equal, not having a refrigerator will likely make one's diet healthier.</p>
    
    <p>
Of course, not having a refrigerator doesn't mean not having a freezer.
When selecting utensils, keep Appropriate response and Which things should I own? in mind. The modern kitchen is full of specialized junk that only serves a single function. Avoid this! For example, instead of putting your spoon or ladle on a spoon rest, put in on a (try to follow this) plate (see Building blocks).</p>
    
    <p> Instead of cooking rice and eggs in dedicated rice and egg cookers, use a pot. Instead of toasting bread in a toaster, use a cast iron pan with a cast iron lid.95 Yes it works. Commit to a single knife.</p>
    
    <p> For most people, this is a short chef's knife, although if you're a vegetarian, a serrated utility/tomato knife is perhaps better. I've had the same $5 tomato knife for over 14 years now--best knife ever.
Detergents, cleaners, and other household stuff I prefer to clean appliances and utensils immediately after using them.
This means that after I'm done using a cutting board or ladle, I clean it immediately.</p>
    
    <p> Since the food isn't dry yet, this makes it very easy to clean and saves time. I try to do the same with general maintenance. Dirt and mess tends to invite more dirt and mess, so it's best kept from establishing a foothold in the first place. Another popular method is waiting for guests to come over and then engaging in a frantic overhaul of the entire home.</p>
    
    <p>
Most household cleaners comprise simple staple ingredients which you can mix yourself, but which are sold in fancy bottles with expensive advertising campaigns to an ignorant public for 10 times the cost. Since their basic ingredients are the same, their effectiveness is too.
The staples are ammonia, baking soda, borax, chlorine, soap, and clear vinegar. Just remember to never combine chlorine and ammonia.</p>
