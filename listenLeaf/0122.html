    <p> (The test is available in a paper-and-pencil version, but today it is most often administered on a computer.) In the standard version of “the Raven,” as it is known, test takers are expected to carry out the required operations in their heads, imagining how each potential choice might or might not fit. The rules of the test don’t permit them to extend their minds with extra-neural resources; they must rely on their internal reasoning processes alone. In the version of the test designed by Clark and his colleagues, by contrast, test takers are able to digitally manipulate the potential solution pieces, moving them around the screen to create new configurations.</p>
    
    <p> To assess the validity of the new test they had created, the researchers recruited 495 students from Leiden University and Erasmus University, both located in the Netherlands. Half the students were randomly assigned to take the conventional version of the Raven; the other half were given the extended-mind variant of the test. In the case of that second group, the researchers monitored how actively test takers engaged in manipulating the layout on the screen.
A suggestive finding soon surfaced: test takers who took full advantage of the new interactive feature were often able to identify patterns that had not been apparent to them before they began shifting the pieces around.</p>
    
    <p> An analysis of the moves they made while taking the test showed that these active extenders seemed to be running their thinking processes through successive loops— switching between external actions, which altered the problem-solving space in helpful ways, and internal evaluations of the new configurations thus created.
“Our study showed very clearly the relationship between the amount of interaction participants engaged in and how well they solved the problems,” says Bruno Bocanegra, an assistant professor of psychology at Erasmus University and the lead author of the paper. “We saw people interacting with the pieces,
reflecting on the new configurations, reassessing their strategy, and then reaching out to interact again. These loops are what allowed them to solve the problems effectively.</p>
    
    <p>” Final results demonstrated that the more test takers extended their minds using the movable pieces, the more successful they were at solving the complex visual puzzles. What’s more, the researchers found, the extended-mind version of the test was better than the standard “static” Raven at predicting students’ test was better than the standard “static” Raven at predicting students’ intellectual performance outside the lab—in the form of the grades they received in their college courses. The test that measured the students’ skill at mental extension, the authors wrote, “might be tapping into an additional behavioral aspect of intelligence that is not currently measured” by conventional IQ tests.
Says Bruno Bocanegra: “People are applying an underappreciated wealth of strategies to solve problems—underappreciated, in part, because people are not good at describing their own thought processes.</p>
    
    <p> They often don’t have conscious access to their strategies—but they are using them nonetheless. We’re interested in studying people over time to see if they can develop more sophisticated strategies.” Bocanegra’s publication is just a start, but it’s easy to envision a broad expansion of similar efforts. Imagine a test that would evaluate how well an individual is able to use interoception, movement, and gesture to think; how adept she is at soaking up natural settings, designing built environments, and exploiting the space of ideas to enhance her cognition; how skillfully she manages thinking with experts, thinking with peers, and thinking with groups.</p>
    
    <p>
Such an assessment could represent a new kind of IQ test, measuring a new sort of intelligence. (“New” in the sense of newly admitted into our society’s definition of smart; as we’ve seen throughout this book, humans have been extending their minds since time immemorial.) “Much more than we usually recognize, humans use their environment to solve problems—an environment that is both material and social,” says Bocanegra. “When you see things that way, it starts to seem very silly to think that we can measure intelligence as some internal, intrinsic, individual quality.</p>
    
    <p>” Of course, it’s possible that such a test would be misused, as IQ tests have so often been misused—employed to rank, divide, and exclude people instead of helping them to develop. But such misuse need not be inevitable. Once we make mental extensions visible, what we do with our new awareness is up to us.
We might begin by applying it to an issue now roiling our society: America’s pervasive inequality, a state of affairs that many are finding ever less justifiable or tolerable.</p>
    
    <p> Defenders of the status quo have long argued that social and economic inequality merely reflects a kind of organic inequality, determined by nature, in the talents and abilities with which individuals are born. That argument appears less plausible when viewed through the lens of the extended mind. If our ability to think intelligently is shaped so profoundly by the availability of extra-neural resources, how then can we continue to justify their extraordinarily inequitable distribution?
In a famous thought experiment, the contemporary philosopher John Rawls imagined designing the ideal society—but doing so from behind a “veil of ignorance” regarding how the designers themselves would fare in the new world they are creating. While engaged in deciding how society’s affluence and opportunities are to be distributed, Rawls writes, “no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like.</p>
