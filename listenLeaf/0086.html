    <p> Other things are expensive but accept inexpensive maintenance parts. Most stuff has storage costs regardless of whether it's used or not. These factors all add up to the total rate of cost of ownership,
which is measured in money/time.
All the little luxuries It's quite interesting to note that by choosing to modify your behavior and give up certain average but comparably incredibly expensive things like $20,000 cars or $50,000 for an extra bedroom, being able to afford, or more accurately, having access to little luxuries becomes a source of pleasure.</p>
    
    <p>
How about owning one of the best pocket knives in the world, the Sebenza made by Chris Reeves?59 Regardless of how much someone spends on a pocket knife, it doesn't get much better than this. The VitaMix blender retailing at more than $400 is similarly considered one of the best blenders that money can buy. Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers are in the same league.
All of these are in a league that is typically beyond what most people have heard of.</p>
    
    <p> Why freeze in "normal" winter clothes when you can wear expedition-quality clothes that are comfortable in a wider range of temperatures and activities?
The typical objection is that these things cost 10 times more than what someone "normally" would pay. However, they also last at least 10 times longer, so the cost isn't that high (see Depreciation schedules). To wit, my boots are 13 years old and my jacket is 14 years old. The cost over time is the same as a cheap unit, but the utility is much higher.</p>
    
    <p> The choice is therefore between using a high-quality item and rarely or never replacing it,
or a typical, low-quality item and replacing it often. Choose the former even though fashion encourages the latter! The great benefit in doing this is that one can slowly build up an inventory of great items. Buy the coat one year.
Next year buy the copper pans.</p>
    
    <p> Then buy the tube amplifier. And so on. You can even think of such luxuries as inflation-proof savings in lieu of precious metals.
This means that you won't have a complete inventory right away, yet it's better than buying a complete but cheap inventory or worse, borrowing to do so.</p>
    
    <p> For now, use whatever you currently have. When what you currently have breaks down or wears out, replace it with something great. Ideally, one would own one coat, one pot, etc.Â and hand it down to the next generation rather than replacing it every time fashion changes.</p>

Mono-use and Multi-use Things should have multiple uses so they can be combined with other things to solve many different problems. Using skill, a superior thing can be combined with other things in many ways. Here a desktop computer is superior to a laptop computer. The difference is that a desktop computer is made of many smaller and widely compatible components that are user- replaceable, given the requisite skills.</p>
    
    <p> While the laptop can do as many things as the desktop, it is, as far as the average user is concerned, one unit,
and so it doesn't integrate as well. Of course, one solution is to become skilled in the art of laptop hardware maintenance. Consider whether an item falls under mono-use or multi-use for clothing, tools, rooms, cars, bicycles-- everything.
Being the master of your stuff I prefer things whose operation can be understood by looking at them.</p>
