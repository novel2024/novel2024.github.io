    <p> In addition to the sterile cockpit concept Pape adapted, health care professionals have also borrowed from pilots the onboard “checklist”—a standardized rundown of tasks to be completed. In this case, too, imitation has worked wonders. In 2009, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization reported that after the surgical teams in their study started using a nineteen-item checklist, the average patient death rate fell more than 40 percent, and the rate of complications decreased by about a third.
The medical field has also adopted the “peer-to-peer assessment technique,” a common practice in the nuclear power industry.</p>
    
    <p> A delegation from one hospital visits another hospital in order to conduct a “structured, confidential, and non- punitive review” of the host institution’s safety and quality efforts. Without the threat of sanctions carried by regulators, these peer reviews can surface problems and suggest fixes, making the technique itself a vehicle for constructive copying among organizations.
Even within health care, however, the practice of imitation leaves much room for improvement. It took seventy years for the checklist concept to migrate from aviation to medicine, and twenty years for the sterile cockpit to make the leap.</p>
    
    <p> A more structured and intentional approach to imitation could speed up this process considerably. In order to elevate the social value of copying, says Shenkar, we need not only to promote new acts of imitation but also to recognize that imitation is already behind the success of many of our most admired individuals and organizations—a group that assuredly includes the famed innovator Steve Jobs.
In 1979, Jobs and his colleagues at the fledgling Apple Computer company were wrestling with how to turn the crude, clunky computers of the day into sleek personal appliances that were easy and even fun to use. In December of that year, he got a glimpse of the solution while on a visit to Xerox PARC, a research facility operated by the photocopier giant in Palo Alto, California.</p>
    
    <p> Jobs was shown a series of technological innovations that he knew he could put to use in his own project: a networking platform that allowed computers to connect to and communicate with one another; a set of visually appealing and user-friendly onscreen graphics; a mouse that enabled users to point and click. “This is it!” he shouted to an Apple associate as their car sped away from PARC. “We’ve got to do it!” In Oded Shenkar’s contemplated academic course on imitation, he might well use Apple as a case study. And he might point out to his class that Jobs had already taken the first of three steps required to solve the all-important correspondence problem.</p>
    
    <p> Step one, according to Shenkar: specify one’s own problem and identify an analogous problem that has been solved successfully.
Step two: rigorously analyze why the solution is successful. Jobs and his engineers at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, immediately got to work deconstructing the marvels they’d seen at the Xerox facility. Soon they were on to the third and most challenging step: identify how one’s own circumstances differ, then figure out how to adapt the original solution to the new setting.</p>
    
    <p> Xerox had already brought its own computer to market, but it was awkward and difficult to use. It was designed for the needs of business rather than the individual consumer. And it was prohibitively expensive, costing more than $16,000.
Xerox had found technological solutions that eluded Apple’s scientists, but it was Jobs who adapted these solutions to the potential market he saw for personal devices.</p>
    
    <p> An example: the mouse he’d seen at PARC had three buttons, which Jobs deemed excessively fussy; it didn’t roll easily, even on smooth surfaces;
and it cost a whopping $300. Jobs worked with a local design firm to produce a one-button mouse that could be operated on any surface (even his blue jeans,
Jobs specified) and that cost only $15.
The rest is history, though not history as it is usually told—a story of solitary geniuses (“the ones who see things differently”). The lesson of this case study is that skilled imitation, and not just brilliant innovation, is behind many of the successes we celebrate.</p>
    
    <p>
 IMITATION EVEN APPEARS to be behind our success as a species. Developmental psychologists are increasingly convinced that infants’ and children’s facility for imitation is what allows them to absorb so much, so quickly. So efficient is imitation as a method of learning, in fact, that roboticists are studying babies in order to understand how they pull off the trick of observing an adult and then doing as the grown-up does. Imagine if a robot could watch a human perform an action—say, place a silicon chip on a circuit board, or make a repair on a space capsule—and then replicate that movement itself.</p>
