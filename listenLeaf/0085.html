    <p> The report found that as many as 98,000 Americans were dying each year as a result of preventable medical errors occurring in hospitals—more people than succumbed to car accidents, workplace injuries, or breast cancer. And some significant portion of these deaths involved mistakes in the dispensing of drugs.
But as she investigated ways to address the medication error crisis, Pape didn’t rack her brain for an innovative fix. Instead she sought to imitate a solution that had been successfully applied in another industry.</p>
    
    <p> That industry was aviation—an enterprise, like health care, in which people’s lives depend on professionals’ precision and accuracy. While reading up on aviation safety, Pape learned that the moments of highest risk occurred during takeoffs and landings— periods when the plane was under ten thousand feet. She spotted a correspondence in her own field: for hospital patients who are given medication,
the riskiest moments happen during the preparation of the drug dosage, and during administration of the drug to the patient.
Delving deeper, Pape discovered that distractions and interruptions of the pilot by other crew members accounted for a majority of airline “incidents.</p>
    
    <p>” Another correspondence came into view: interruptions of health care professionals, she knew, were also to blame for many medication mistakes. (Consider this striking incident reported by a team of researchers observing real-life conditions in hospitals: one nurse, dispensing one medication, to one single patient, was interrupted seventeen times.) Pape also became aware that aviation experts had devised a solution to the problem of pilot interruption: the “sterile cockpit rule.” Instituted by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1981, the rule forbids pilots from engaging in conversation unrelated to the immediate business of flying when the plane is below ten thousand feet.</p>
    
    <p>
In her 2002 dissertation, and then in a series of articles published in medical journals, Pape made a case for imitating this practice. “The key to preventing medication errors lies with adopting protocols from other safety-focused industries,” Pape wrote in the journal MEDSURG Nursing in 2003. “The airline industry, for example, has methods in place that improve pilots’ focus and provide a milieu of safety when human life is at stake.” Such methods could be adapted to the hospital setting, she argued, by creating a “no-interruptions zone” around medication preparation areas, and by having nurses who are administering medication wear special vests or sashes signaling that they are not to be disturbed.</p>
    
    <p> Added Pape, pointedly, “Medication administration should be considered as critical as piloting a plane, because patients place their lives in the hands of healthcare professionals.” Pape wasn’t sure if her peers in the health care community would be open to listening to the idea. But listen they did. Hospitals began following the lead of airlines, and the change made a dramatic difference.</p>
    
    <p> At Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco Medical Center, for example, the introduction of no- interruption signaling in 2006 led to the “virtual elimination of nurse distractions for those wearing the vests,” according to the US government’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Over a six-month period, medication errors at the hospital fell by 47 percent. Nearly two decades after she initiated it, Pape’s lifesaving act of imitation has spread all over the country and the world.
Tess Pape figured out the correspondence problem on her own.</p>
    
    <p> But what if she had been taught how to imitate? Imitating well is a skill, one that Oded Shenkar believes should be deliberately cultivated. Shenkar, a professor of management and human resources at Ohio State University, studies how companies use imitation to gain a strategic edge in the marketplace. He maintains that we are living in a golden “age of imitation,” in which access to information about how other people are addressing problems similar to our own has made it more feasible than ever to copy effective solutions. Shenkar would like to see students in business schools and other graduate programs taking courses on effective imitation.</p>
    
    <p> He imagines companies opening “imitation departments,” devoted to identifying promising opportunities for copying. And he anticipates a day when successful imitators are celebrated and admired just as much as innovators are now.
Shenkar notes that at least one profession has been taking steps in the direction of his push: health care. The urgent need to reduce medical errors,
perceived by Tess Pape and many others, has led hospitals to imitate the practices of a host of other industries, including the military, railroads, chemical manufacturing, nuclear power—and, of course, aviation.</p>
