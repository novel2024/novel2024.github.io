The depreciation principle is widely understood to apply to cars, given the popularity of the used car market. Most people have an idea of the blue book value of their car--that is, how much it can be sold for used. However,
everything else has a market price even if it doesn't have an army of salesmen or corresponding blue book. Make it a point to know the market price of all your stuff.</p>
    
    <p> Doing so makes it a simple matter to calculate the annual depreciation cost, which is the true cost of ownership. Everything I own is for sale. In my mind, I'm only holding it temporarily. If I need something else for a while, I can always buy it on eBay or find it on Freecycle or Craig's List.</p>
    
    <p> In this way, these become like giant libraries of stuff I can "rent" for a while at the cost of depreciation. With sufficient capital, the initial outlay never matters. What matters is the depreciation cost because this determines how much value can be recovered. Even though this is nominally ownership, I prefer not to think of it this way,
which allows me to avoid becoming attached to my stuff.</p>

Here are some examples of the right ways and the wrong ways to do it:
Consider our dining room set. It was bought used for $75 from a couple who initially bought it for their kids for when they moved out. However, by the time the kids moved out, the kids decided they wanted something else.
We had it for 2.</p>
    
    <p>5 years, took good care of it, and sold it for $70. The expense of this set was ($75-$70)/2.5 = $2/year, and so from a financial standpoint it was practically free.58 This was the right way to do it.</p>
    
    <p> The wrong way is illustrated by our sofa purchase. We bought it on closeout at $300 (previously $600), sold at $100, and held it 3 years. Cost of $67/year.
That was comparably expensive.</p>
    
    <p> The person who bought it from us got a good deal, though; be that person.
Measuring use is important. It can be measured in time as in the equation above, but sometimes it's more reasonable to measure the use in "miles driven" or "times used" rather than "years used." For instance,
buying a food processor for $75 and selling it for $15 three years later equals a depreciation cost of ($75-$15)/3=$20/year.</p>
    
    <p> However, if it was only used 15 times during the 3 years, a more telling calculation would be ($75-$15)/15=$4/use. That's one expensive food processor (see Appropriate response)!
An additional cost to factor in is a potential running cost which is there even if the thing isn't used or rarely used. A car requires insurance even if it's rarely driven. Some things are inexpensive but require expensive maintenance parts.</p>
