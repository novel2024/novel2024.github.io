    <p> The good thing about it is that it adjusts. You will probably find yourself making great strides in the first month, particularly if you're untrained, as neuromuscular connections adapt. After that,
progression will be much slower. Also note that at the more advanced stages the entire workout will take less than 10 minutes, yet the volume will be as high as what regular people spend an hour in the gym completing.</p>

Intensity levels The following is a useful gauge for subjective exercise intensity. Intense exercise happens beyond level 7. I've been to level 10 twice in my life. On second thought, maybe it was only level 9.</p>
    
    <p> While the levels seem unscientific, they actually correlate rather well with the amount of surplus oxygen you can use to talk with.
1. You can hold a continuous tone.
2.</p>
    
    <p> You can tell your life story.
3. You can speak in paragraphs.
4.</p>
    
    <p> You can carry on a conversation.
5. You can talk in sentences.
6.</p>
    
    <p> You can speak a few words at a time.
7. You can pronounce a syllable or two at a time.
8.</p>
    
    <p> You can't possibly breathe any faster than this.
9. You think you will die.
10.</p>
    
    <p> You wish you were dead.
The best exercise intensity, in terms of calories burned and increase of cardiovascular capacity, is right around the lactic acid threshold--that is,
where the body starts running out of oxygen, somewhere between level 7 and 8. Conversely, most aerobic workouts happen at level 4 because it burns the most fat87 relative to blood sugar, and especially because this lower level doesn't scare off the beginners, who are very important to the fitness industry.
Measuring progress To gauge progress, I use the "overhead pound.</p>
