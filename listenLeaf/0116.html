    <p> We couldn’t know all that our fellow group members know, nor should we want to; our mental bandwidth would quickly become overloaded. We do,
however, need to know that they know it, in order to call upon it when it’s needed. The process by which we leverage an awareness of the knowledge other people possess is called “transactive memory.” It could be said that the study of transactive memory began on the day when Daniel Wegner and Toni Giuliano were wed.</p>
    
    <p> The groom later wrote: “Toni and I noticed not long after we were married that we were sharing memory duties. I remembered where car and yard things were, she remembered where house things were, and we could each depend on the other to be an expert in domains we didn’t need to master.” As social psychologists, Wegner and Giuliano quickly identified their experience as not only an interesting feature of newlywed life but also a promising target of scientific investigation. A year later the couple (along with colleague Paula Hertel) published a paper introducing what Wegner called a new way “to understand the group mind.</p>
    
    <p>” As he observed:
“Nobody remembers everything. Instead, each of us in a couple or group remembers some things personally—and then can remember much more by knowing who else might know what we don’t. In this way, we become part of a transactive memory system.” Over the past few decades, psychologists have confirmed Wegner’s claim that a robust transactive memory system effectively multiplies the amount of information each group member has.</p>
    
    <p> Members of such groups are able to work on deepening their own areas of expertise while still remaining in contact,
through their colleagues, with a broader range of relevant information. Their cognitive load is reduced, as they need only to attend in the moment to the portion of incoming information that concerns them, secure in the knowledge that their teammates are doing the same. And members of these groups are able to engage in smooth and efficient coordination, directing tasks to those members who are best suited to carry them out. As a result, research finds, teams that build a strong transactive memory structure perform better than teams for which that structure is less defined.</p>
    
    <p>
Within a group of any size, a transactive memory system will spontaneously assemble itself, as it did for Daniel Wegner and Toni Giuliano once they married and began living together. But because such systems usually aren’t cultivated in an intentional way, much of their potential to extend the group’s intelligence is lost. The goal of such cultivation is to make the group aware of what its members know, without requiring each member to take on the full burden of her teammates’ specialized knowledge. Notice how this model differs from early notions of the “group mind,” in which members of a group were believed to be thinking the same thoughts at the same time.</p>
    
    <p> By contrast, the value of a transactive memory system lies in its members thinking different thoughts while also remaining aware of the contents of their fellow members’ minds. The struggle to cope with information overload has led many of us to turn to technological filters—smartphone alerts and email applications that offer to sort for us the information that must be attended to from the information that can be ignored. Research suggests, however, that other people can function as the most sensitive and discriminating filters of all—as long as we’re aware of what they know and can access their knowledge when we need it.
All of us maintain a set of mental markers that help us locate information we don’t currently possess; we may not recall every detail contained in a report, but we know the folder (physical or digital) where the report can be found.</p>
    
    <p> Such markers also point us toward the people who possess information we do not; the aim in building a robust transactive memory system is to make these pointers as explicit and as accurate as possible. The process of setting out these markers should begin early in a team’s work together. It’s important to establish from the outset not only who’s responsible for doing what but also who’s responsible for knowing what. Group members should be explicitly informed about their colleagues’ distinctive talents or spheres of specialization, and clear protocols should be established for directing questions and tasks to the appropriate individual.</p>
    
    <p> Research shows that groups perform best when each member is clearly in charge of maintaining a particular body of expertise—when each topic has its designated “knowledge champion,” as it were. Studies further suggest that it can be useful to appoint a meta-knowledge champion: an individual who is responsible for keeping track of what others in the group know and making sure that group members’ mental “directory” of who knows what stays up to date.
There’s one more way in which solo thought and collective thought differ. For an individual thinking on her own, applying her mental effort toward the advancement of her own interests is a straightforward matter.</p>
