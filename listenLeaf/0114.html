The shift is easiest to see—and to measure—in the social and physical sciences, where contributions by single individuals were once the norm. Today,
fewer than 10 percent of journal articles in science and technology are authored by just one person. An analysis of book chapters and journal articles written across the social sciences likewise found “a sharp decline in single-author publishing.” In economics, solo-authored articles once predominated; now they account for only about 25 percent of publications in the discipline.</p>
    
    <p> In the legal field, a 2014 survey of law reviews concluded that nowadays, “team authors dominate solo authors in the production of legal knowledge.” Even the familiar archetype of the solo inventor (think Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell) is no longer representative. A 2011 report found that over the previous forty years, the number of individuals listed on each US patent application had steadily increased; nearly 70 percent of applications now named multiple inventors.
This development is more than an academic fad, says Brian Uzzi, a professor of management at Northwestern University who conducted some of this research: “It suggests that the process of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed.</p>
    
    <p>” More broadly, Uzzi notes, “almost everything that human beings do today, in terms of generation of value, is no longer done by individuals. It’s done by teams.” What has not changed is our model of how intelligent thinking happens. We’re still convinced that good ideas and new insights and ingenious solutions come from a single brain; we’re a bunch of pencil-wielding Satyendra Boses in an era of particle accelerators and mega-collaborations.</p>
    
    <p> This fundamental mismatch lies at the root of many of our struggles with group work.
It’s time we tossed out that individual model and replaced it with one better suited to the world in which we actually live. We can begin by identifying those ways in which thinking with a group is different from thinking on our own, and by instituting new practices that support the smooth operation of the group mind.
Once these practices are put into place, research shows, a group can think more efficiently and more effectively than any one of its members—a phenomenon that psychologists call “collective intelligence.</p>
    
    <p>” The ways in which group thinking differs from individual thinking are obvious and yet almost always overlooked. The first of these: When we think on our own, all of our thoughts get a hearing. But when we think as part of a team,
it takes intentional effort to ensure that everyone speaks up and that everyone shares what they know. Research on group dynamics reveals that this rarely happens.</p>
    
    <p> Instead, very few people—and sometimes just one—dominate the conversation; in addition, group members often neglect to contribute their “uniquely-held information,” gravitating instead to discussion of information that everyone present already knows. Thus do less than optimal patterns of communication produce the inefficiency and ill will associated with group work,
without generating any of the potential benefits.
This outcome isn’t inevitable, however; simple changes in the way communication is carried out can steer teams toward the group mind. Steven Rogelberg, a professor of management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, notes that group members “often hold back in meetings, waiting to hear what others say and what their boss might say out of fear of being perceived as difficult, out of touch, or off the mark.</p>
    
    <p>” Asking attendees to write out their contributions instead of speaking them, he says, “can be a solution to this problem, allowing space for unique knowledge and novel ideas to emerge.” Participants jot down their thoughts on index cards, which the group’s leader then reads aloud. Or they write them on sheets of paper posted around the room,
after which participants circulate again—this time marking down comments on their colleagues’ ideas, which the group as a whole then discusses.
Another potential change to communication patterns centers on the behavior of group leaders.</p>
    
    <p> Cass Sunstein is a professor at Harvard Law School who also served as administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under Barack Obama. Upon assuming this role, Sunstein learned a valuable lesson in group leadership: if he began a meeting by stating his own views, he discovered, the ensuing discussion was far less expansive and open than if he started out by saying, “What do you all think? This is a tough one.” As soon as a leader makes his preferences known, says Sunstein, many who work for him will choose to engage in “self-silencing” rather than rock the boat with a dissenting view. And, he notes, “some people are more likely to silence themselves than others”; these may include women and members of minority groups, as well as individuals with less status, less experience, or less education.</p>
