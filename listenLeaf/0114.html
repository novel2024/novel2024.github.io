    <p> This may explain why most women stay away from any dumbbell that is not ultralight--usually they are color-coded pink--although lifting heavier weights could do wonders for preventing bone loss--a solution currently sold in pill form--and increasing everyday capabilities. Since "manly" bulk is currently fashionable,83 guys have no such concerns, and therefore a lot of work goes toward increasing muscle tissue primarily on the biceps, chest,
and quadriceps to manipulate the body into a certain look. However, much of this work is directed towards the illusion of real strength,84 and not as much real world strength as the look suggests.85 This is similar to how driving a luxury car these days mostly means being able to put one's mark on a lease or a car loan, whereas it used to indicate a measure of wealth since only the really wealthy would be able to pay cash for a luxury vehicle.</p>

Functional fitness Functional fitness is a recent drive to reintegrate the isolation exercises of regular strength training and instead focus on whole-body movements. It doesn't seek to build the body for appearance, but for function. It's perhaps the first step towards moving exercise out of the gym and reintegrating body movement with everyday life. For now, it still resides in gyms, most likely because it has become difficult to find enough exercise outside in the real world, where everything that previously required physical work has been replaced with internal combustion engines, electric tools and appliances, and paper-pushing jobs to buy them.</p>
    
    <p>
The gym, however, is a good place to start before venturing out in the real world and doing real things. It's a place of physiological preparation,
where real world strength is built up using movements which are similar in form, strength, intensity, and work capacity to real world movements. For instance, the clean and jerk corresponds to picking up an unconscious person, the vertical row corresponds to pulling a rope, the squat corresponds to picking up a child, and the power clean corresponds to stacking sacks of corn. With a solid foundation in functional fitness, activities like cycling,
walking, running, double digging a garden, or doing laundry with a plunger will be quite easy in comparison.</p>
    
    <p> It'll be the equivalent of driving a powerful SUV, tow-package, hybrid, and all that.
Being in the right shape means an enhanced ability to tolerate cold,
since it depends on muscularity (static) and work capacity (dynamic). A high work capacity is the ability to perform physical work as fast as possible. Similarly, the ability to tolerate heat depends on a low body fat percentage.</p>
    
    <p> If you never experience heat, you can carry more body fat.
However, it's easier not to carry it and simply add a layer of clothes. The proper physical conditioning is thus aligned with the problem of heating and cooling (see Heating and cooling).
It's possible never to be out of breath walking up stairs or otherwise engaging in normal activities, like cycling 10 miles to work or carrying a heavy package.</p>
    
    <p> It's possible never to be sore after an activity. It's possible to have fun engaging in strenuous physical activities into your 60s or beyond.
The reason that people get weak is not age; it's a history of disuse, a process many start right out of college. I think that maintaining this functionally into old age will make life enjoyable for a long time.</p>
    
    <p> I notice that my 80- year-old grandmother, who grew up on a farm, until recently was stronger than my mother, who was a stay-at-home mom and is yet still stronger than my wife, who writes reports most of the day. This is despite the ~25-year age differences between them, but it parallels the progression of my grandmother using her hands and a balloon whip, my mother using her hands and an electric mixer, while we use a breadmaking machine. This trend is best reversed.
High-intensity interval training There is an absolute standard of fitness.</p>
    
    <p> To be fit is to be able to drag or carry an unconscious adult out of a burning house on one, maybe two gulps of air. Alternatively, it's to outsprint a dog, given a head start, and climb over a 7ft wall. To be fit is to be able to fight and defeat anyone who can outrun you and outrun anyone you can't defeat.
The most effective way to reach that particular kind of fitness is high- intensity interval training, and the best way I can think of that won't cost an arm and a leg in equipment or gym fees is the "clean and pushpress.</p>
