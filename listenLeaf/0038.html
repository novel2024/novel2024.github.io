    <p> If the working man puts some effort into job searching, he should be able to move through a succession of employment contracts. While the lack of a steady paycheck may seem risky, it's actually safer, as the working man has been conditioned to the situation of having to find new jobs--he actually thinks of them as clients rather than employers, and thus considers it normal. A salary man is rarely without a job, but when he is, it's a high-stress event, almost like a death in the family.
Still, the consumer pattern of a working man is similar to that of the salary man.</p>
    
    <p> As working men generally earn less, there's a drive--you only need to watch a commercial from your local college to see how this works-- from the working class to the salaried class, as the latter is able to spend more and is hence is perceived to live a better life. The public perception of a link between cost of living and quality of life is strong.
The businessman The difference between the businessman and the working man or the salary man is that the cash flow, which is directly associated with the personal consumption of the businessman, is just a fraction of the total business cash flow he controls. The money under control is typically retained earnings from operations, paid-in capital, or simply borrowed from other investors.</p>
    
    <p> Hence, the businessman sets up a business by using a combination of his own and other people's savings--that is, other people's money (OPM, pronounced "opium"). This business may take many forms,
from owning a rental home to sole proprietorships and partnerships, to corporations of various sizes. A business generates cash flow by converting assets into income. The businessman inserts himself into this cash flow.</p>
    
    <p> By being in control of more than just his own time and energy, he controls more cash flow and thus earns more.
Some businessmen create jobs by putting together assets and resources in a structure that is profitable, making it possible for workers to earn a wage. This combination creates a solution to a problem in the form of a product that can be sold. The problems are typically those of consumers,
who buy the businessman's products, but they could also be problems related to government, military, or other business operations.</p>
    
    <p>
The cycle has thus come full circle. The salary man and the working man spend all their time working and little of their time solving complex problems using assets. This kind of problem-solving is done by the businessman in return for profit. However, the businessman still relies on other people to turn assets into profit as well as for his income.</p>
    
    <p>
Profit generation is complicated by the presence of competitors, who tend to drive down returns and decrease profit margins. Decreased profit margins mean that the businessman has to use leverage or become much more competitive to keep making a profit. This leverage is obtained by using OPM to increase the size of the cycle, thus resulting in a tight coupling of the business cash flow. If something in the cycle fails, it doesn't take much to significantly impact the profit margin.</p>
    
    <p> The slack in this system is given by equity, which is the slack between assets and liabilities (debt) in the cycle. The smaller the equity is relative to the assets and the earnings,
the more vulnerable the business is to perturbations of the cycle and the higher the returns or losses will be. Competition may therefore require the businessman to restructure his operations, diverting cash flows elsewhere as parts of the operation are "creatively destroyed." While a lot of value can be destroyed, the broad industry knowledge survives to a large extent.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, with the introduction of new technology or the decline of rental income in certain neighborhoods, the structural knowledge of the businessman remains the same, as do most of the procedures of doing business. Only the assets are replaced. In a recession, the procedures of doing business may change--some specialists (assets) may be laid off, but the technology remains the same. In the figure,
this situation would correspond to shifting the generalist curve a bit.</p>
