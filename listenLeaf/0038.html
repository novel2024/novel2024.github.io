    <p> If you are looking for a psychopath in your life, you will not likely find one if you are only looking for violence and bloodlust.
Myth #6: Psychopathy is a mental illness that can be cured.
Truth: Psychopathy is a personality disorder that has no cure.
If psychopathy were a mental illness, there would be an option for treatments.</p>
    
    <p> Instead, psychopathy is a personality disorder, and this means that no cure exists that would turn psychopaths into normal, feeling, and empathetic human beings. Because they really do not believe that anything is wrong with them anyway, psychopaths would not even be interested in treatment even if it existed. In instances where psychopaths have been convinced to get into therapy for purposes of mending existing relationships,
it is not uncommon to find them trying to manipulate the therapist into thinking that the therapy is working or has already worked. Remember, these individuals are highly manipulative and capable of utilizing whatever means necessary to get themselves out of difficult situations.</p>
    
    <p> Thanks to their bold lack of fear and absence of empathy, a psychopath will have no problem wasting a loved one’s time in therapy if only to make it seem like they are making an effort.
Myth #7: You can change a person on the dark triad by loving them correctly.
Truth: Most people who score highly on the dark triad test remain so for the rest of their lives.
Love is a strange thing in that it makes people believe that they are capable of the impossible, even when the truth is laid bare before their eyes.</p>
    
    <p> If you are in a relationship with a person who scores highly on the dark triad test,
the first few months of your relationship are likely to be blissful.
Manipulative people have a way of love-bombing you into believing that they are the perfect match that you have been waiting for all along.
Unfortunately, this is usually just an attempt to lure and entrap you into a relationship that is just smoke and mirrors. Once you have settled into this kind of relationship, the manipulator’s true colors come to light.</p>
    
    <p> In many cases, you will find a relationship partner sticking around with the hope that things will change. That love will be enough to turn things around.
Unfortunately, this often never happens.
For starters, the fact that psychopathy is mostly genetic means that it is incredibly difficult to defeat.</p>
    
    <p> At best, the psychopath can only channel their lack of sensitivity towards achieving goals that are not detrimental to the overall society. As for Machiavellianism and narcissism, these often stem from deep psychological trauma that may require a whole lot of arsenal to overcome. Many people will gravitate towards Machiavellianism and narcissism as a defense mechanism. Any attempt to get them out of this will only come across as an attack thus causing them to launch their own defense.</p>
    
    <p>
As such, intervention in the form of love may be incredibly counterproductive. It is also necessary to acknowledge that love and other flippant emotions are not exactly a dark triad person’s cup of tea. They may not even notice it for what it is. As such, should you find yourself in a relationship with a person who exhibits the characteristics of the dark triad,
you might want to re-examine whether that is what you really want.</p>
    
    <p>
Myth #8: People who score highly on the dark triad are more attractive.
Truth: This has been established to be untrue.
Why is it that people often gravitate towards the narcissists and the psychopaths of this world? Is it because the dark triad personalities are more attractive than the rest of us? In a bid to determine whether dark triad personalities are better-looking, academic researchers took to studying several subjects who had high dark triad scores. The results of these studies suggested that the reason why these subjects appeared attractive was because they dressed up and presented themselves physically in a manner that was well put together.</p>
