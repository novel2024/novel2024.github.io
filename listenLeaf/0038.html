    <p> In each exchange, gesture provides a preview of the concept that will be conveyed in words—and in both cases, the listener shows that he or she understands the sentiment (by nodding and murmuring) at the moment when he or she perceives the gesture, before the spoken part of the sentiment is uttered. From watching Heath’s tapes, it’s easy to conclude that most of our conversations are carried on with our hands, the words we speak a mere afterthought.
Research shows that we all engage in such “gestural foreshadowing,” in which our hands anticipate what we’re about to say. When we realize we’ve said something in error and we pause to go back to correct it, for example, we stop gesturing a couple of hundred milliseconds before we stop speaking.</p>
    
    <p> Such sequences suggest the startling notion that our hands “know” what we’re going to say before our conscious minds do, and in fact this is often the case. Gesture can mentally prime a word so that the right term comes to our lips. When people are prevented from gesturing, they talk less fluently; their speech becomes halting because their hands are no longer able to supply them with the next word, and the next. Not being able to gesture has other deleterious effects:
without gesture to help our mental processes along, we remember less useful information, we solve problems less well, and we are less able to explain our thinking.</p>
    
    <p> Far from tagging along as speech’s clumsy companion, gesture represents the leading edge of our thought.
 GESTURE WAS HUMANITY’S first language—and every human infant recapitulates this evolutionary history, becoming fluent in gesture in advance of acquiring even the rudiments of speech. Well before babies can talk, they are waving,
beckoning, holding up their arms in a wordless signal: Pick me up. Pointing is one of children’s first gestures, usually initiated around nine months of age;
between ten and fourteen months, a more nuanced capacity for gesture begins to develop as fine-motor finger control improves.</p>
    
    <p> During this time, spoken language lags well behind what toddlers are able to express by moving their hands. Children can typically understand and act on a request to point to their nose, for example, a full six months before they are able to form the spoken word “nose.” And, research suggests, they use their gestures to elicit from their caretakers the very words they need to hear as they learn about the world. A child will point to an unfamiliar object, for example, and an adult will often obligingly supply the name of that thing.</p>
    
    <p> When a parent “translates” her child’s gesture into a word in this way, that word is particularly likely to enter the child’s spoken vocabulary within a few months. Amazingly enough, as one researcher puts it, “Young children use their hands to tell their mothers what to say.” These early experiences with gesture lay the foundation for spoken language.
Gesture constitutes a first attempt at the trick of making one thing (a movement of the body, the sound of a word) stand for another (a physical object, a social act).</p>
    
    <p> Connecting a wish—say, to get down from a high chair—with the spoken word “down” is a sophisticated mental move; performing a downward motion of the hand can function as an important intermediate step. Indeed, researchers have documented a link between a child’s rate of gesturing at fourteen months and the size of that same child’s vocabulary at four and a half years of age.
Children learn to make these movements from the gesturing figures around them: adults. Studies show that children whose parents gesture a lot proceed to gesture frequently themselves, and eventually to acquire expansive spoken-word vocabularies.</p>
    
    <p>
Child development experts have long emphasized the importance of talking to children; an often cited 1995 study carried out by psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley estimated a 30-million “word gap” in the number of words heard spoken aloud by affluent and poor children by the time they start school. Since the publication of the Hart-Risley study, other research has confirmed that higher-income parents tend to talk more than lower-income parents, that they employ a greater diversity of word types, that they compose more complex and more varied sentences—and that these differences are predictive of child vocabulary. Now researchers are generating evidence that how parents gesture with their children matters as well—and that socioeconomic differences in how often parents use their hands when talking to children may be producing what we could call a “gesture gap.” High-income parents gesture more than low-income parents, research finds.</p>
    
    <p>
And it’s not just the quantity of gesture that differs but also the quality: more affluent parents provide a greater variety of types of gesture, representing more categories of meaning—physical objects, abstract concepts, social signals.
Parents and children from poorer backgrounds, meanwhile, tend to use a narrower range of gestures when they interact with each other. Following the example set by their parents, high-income kids gesture more than their low- income counterparts. In one study, fourteen-month-old children from high- income, well-educated families used gesture to convey an average of twenty- four different meanings during a ninety-minute observation session, while children from lower-income families conveyed only thirteen meanings.</p>
