Such interoceptive prodding was visible during a gambling game that formed the basis of an experiment led by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, a professor at the University of Southern California. In the game, presented on a computer screen, players were given a starting purse of two thousand “dollars” and were shown four decks of digital cards. Their task, they were told, was to turn the cards in the decks face-up, choosing which decks to draw from such that they would lose the least amount of money and win the most. As they started clicking to turn over cards, players began encountering rewards—bonuses of $50 here,
$100 there—and also penalties, in which small or large amounts of money were taken away.</p>
    
    <p> What the experimenters had arranged, but the players were not told,
was that decks A and B were “bad”—they held lots of large penalties in store— and decks C and D were “good,” bestowing more rewards than penalties over time.
As they played the game, the participants’ state of physiological arousal was monitored via electrodes attached to their fingers; these electrodes kept track of their level of “skin conductance.” When our nervous systems are stimulated by an awareness of potential threat, we start to perspire in a barely perceptible way.
This slight sheen of sweat momentarily turns our skin into a better conductor of electricity.</p>
    
    <p> Researchers can thus use skin conductance as a measure of nervous system arousal. Looking over the data collected by the skin sensors, Damasio and his colleagues noticed something interesting: after the participants had been playing for a short while, their skin conductance began to spike when they contemplated clicking on the bad decks of cards. Even more striking, the players started avoiding the bad decks, gravitating increasingly to the good decks. As in the Lewicki study, subjects got better at the task over time, losing less and winning more.</p>
    
    <p>
Yet interviews with the participants showed that they had no awareness of why they had begun choosing some decks over others until late in the game,
long after their skin conductance had started flaring. By card 10 (about forty-five seconds into the game), measures of skin conductance showed that their bodies were wise to the way the game was rigged. But even ten turns later—on card 20 —“all indicated that they did not have a clue about what was going on,” the researchers noted. It took until card 50 was turned, and several minutes had elapsed, for all the participants to express a conscious hunch that decks A and B were riskier.</p>
    
    <p> Their bodies figured it out long before their brains did. Subsequent studies supplied an additional, and crucial, finding: players who were more interoceptively aware were more apt to make smart choices within the game. For them, the body’s wise counsel came through loud and clear.
Damasio’s fast-paced game shows us something important.</p>
    
    <p> The body not only grants us access to information that is more complex than what our conscious minds can accommodate. It also marshals this information at a pace that is far quicker than our conscious minds can handle. The benefits of the body’s intervention extend well beyond winning a card game; the real world, after all, is full of dynamic and uncertain situations, in which there is no time to ponder all the pros and cons. If we rely on the conscious mind alone, we lose.</p>
    
    <p>
 HERE, THEN, is a reason to hone our interoceptive sense: people who are more aware of their bodily sensations are better able to make use of their non- conscious knowledge. Mindfulness meditation is one way of enhancing such awareness. The practice has been found to increase sensitivity to internal signals,
and even to alter the size and activity of that key brain structure, the insula. One particular component appears to be especially effective; this is the activity that often starts off a meditation session, known as the “body scan.</p>
    
    <p>” Rooted in the Buddhist traditions of Myanmar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, the body scan was introduced to Western audiences by mindfulness pioneer Jon Kabat-Zinn, now a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. “People find the body scan beneficial because it reconnects their conscious mind to the feeling states of their body,” says Kabat-Zinn. “By practicing regularly, people usually feel more in touch with sensations in parts of their body they had never felt or thought much about before.” To practice the body scan, he explains, we should first sit or lie down in a comfortable place, allowing our eyes to close gently.</p>
