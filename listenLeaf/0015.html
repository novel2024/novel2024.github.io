    <p> Why boil eggs in a pot when there are 350 varieties of electric egg boilers available? A common misconception is that money is better--or is that "more successfully?"--spent on granite countertops and restaurant-strength food processors and burners than on cooking classes and practice. Who has the time anyway?
This behavior is pervasive. People with more money than time buy $3,000 road racing bicycles with ultralight carbon frames to shave two pounds off the bike, regardless of the fact that they themselves are probably at least 10 pounds overweight, and only take a slow ride once a week because they lack the leg power to go faster and the time to go more often.
Compare this to the amateur enthusiast with more time than money, who rides every day and thus has the power to ride his much less expensive bike much faster.</p>
    
    <p> Who enjoys riding more?
For recreation, many believe that saving for a year to drop a large sum on a hectic one-week vacation in an exotic locale is more recreational than staying closer to home and taking a month off to relax. A hectic tourist experience is considered very successful.
A prerequisite for this kind of consumer success is spending money.
This money must either be inherited or earned.</p>
    
    <p> If that isn't possible, it will be borrowed. Most are not lucky enough to win the birth lottery and inherit their money, and so they have to earn their money. Since acquiring the things that demonstrate success only requires the short time needed to purchase some item, and practically no time actually using or enjoying said item--that is, unless a five-bedroom/three-bathroom home can be enjoyed remotely from one's cubicle while at work--people can dedicate most of their time to earning money rather than using and enjoying the things the money buys.
This results in having little time to develop skills other than spending money, which can be witnessed by the confused helplessness modern people demonstrate towards solving problems without spending money or arguing on the phone with a service representative.</p>
    
    <p> Consumers are used to buying or arguing their way out of problems. For $150 you can buy a propane grill at the supermarket or you can spend $300 to have a plumber fix a drain, but a person doing these things has learned nothing. Make a habit out of this and you'll become helpless and deadly afraid of losing your income, as the work-spend method only works as long as there is sufficient income.
Hence, so much effort is expended on earning money or finding ways to earn money that people mostly don't fail to work 40, 80, or even more than 100 hours each week, leaving little time to question their lives or otherwise get in trouble.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, being overworked comes with its own problems,
such as stress, insomnia, and high blood pressure, but typically these problems can be solved by spending money to eliminate, or at least cover up, the symptoms--money that, ironically, has to be earned by additional work. In many ways, modern society seems to be using a slightly more complicated version of a Keynesian economic stimulus scheme where the economy is stimulated by having some people dig a hole, then having others fill it back in the next day. We create problems, spend the next day solving them, and then claim we have made progress. We're even following Keynes' suggestion quite literally when we dig resources out of the ground,
fashion them into consumer objects, temporarily store them in our homes,
rarely use them, and eventually replace them with a new and bigger model,
while sending the old and likely still functional object to a landfill--back in the ground.</p>
    
    <p>6 Sure, this increases economic growth, which is a measure of how busy people are turning their money over, but is being busy a good measure of wealth?
For years, I've been wondering whether there is a small group of cynical people who are pulling our strings and intentionally creating problems so that others may solve them, or whether we're all pulling each other's strings because we're too busy paying attention to day-to-day problems like paying bills, going to work, and keeping up with all the shows on TV.
Seen from the outside, the above-mentioned behavior makes no sense.
However, when seen from the inside, everything makes perfect sense,
because personal values and personal behavior eventually become aligned with the interest of the status quo. Having a job so that the bills get paid and one can go back home every night and pass out in front of the TV is what the good life is all about, right? Most people would agree, because most people can't imagine any alternatives.</p>
    
    <p> They are, in other words, prisoners chained to the floor in Plato's Cave.
To break away mentally, one needs to be conscious of the fact that one is chained to the floor in Plato's Cave. The best way to understand this is to see the cave--that is, your current perspective--from a different perspective- -namely, looking into the cave from the outside. Here is what I see.</p>

Education and training Children naturally try to emulate their parents, at least in the early years,
and for the most part a child's values are a direct reflection of his parents',
either conformingly aligned or diametrically opposed. Traditionally, parents have played a large role in their children's upbringing. Through watching and emulating, children learn life skills such as respect for others, the virtue of doing chores or performing a day's work for a day's pay, balancing a checkbook or keeping track of money, how to judge value, how to get good deals, eat inexpensively, cook a meal and do dishes, bake bread, clean,
declutter, ride a bicycle, tend a garden, hang up a shelf, or fix a plugged drain. However, as people have increased their expenses, households now require two incomes, and thus, as it so often goes in our time, parents have outsourced their children's upbringing and, possibly taking a lesson from their own situation as wage slaves, they now act as managers of their children's lives and careers rather than as role models, signing them up for extracurricular activities that are so very important for their résumé to get into their dream college.</p>
