Chinnici’s study found that students who had engaged in role-playing mitosis and meiosis achieved a more accurate understanding of the concept—a result mirrored in other, similar studies. Researchers have examined the effects of having students embody the solar system’s planets as they engage in direct and retrograde motion; of having students embody carbon molecules as they undergo the enzymatic reactions of the Krebs cycle; and of having students embody amino acids undergoing polymerization as they are synthesized into proteins. In each of these scenarios, students learned more and performed better when they were offered the opportunity to embody these entities rather than simply reading or hearing about them.
“Being it”—embodying a conceptual object—is a very different experience from “watching it,” or viewing a conceptual object as “remote and separate from oneself,” notes Carmen Petrick Smith of the University of Vermont, who has studied the effects of physically embodying mathematical concepts.</p>
    
    <p> Groups of students might form a triangle with their outstretched arms, for example, and then experiment with moving closer to and farther away from one another; in this way they come to understand that the size of a triangle can vary without changing the degree of the angles at its corners. Smith notes that such “body- based activities” have been shown to deepen students’ understanding and strengthen their memory of mathematical concepts. Mathematics teachers have long incorporated manipulatives into their instruction—counting rods and cubes,
for example. The research of Smith and others suggests that students learn even more when the “manipulatives” they employ are their own bodies.</p>

 ONE FINAL CATEGORY of thought-enhancing movements encompasses those that enact an analogy, whether explicit or implicit. The language we use is full of metaphors that borrow from our experience as embodied creatures; metaphorical movements reverse-engineer this process, putting the body through the motions as a way of prodding the mind into the state the metaphor describes. “Moving the body can alter the mind by unconsciously putting ideas in our head before we are able to consciously contemplate them on our own,” as Sian Beilock has written. “Getting a person to move lowers his threshold for experiencing thoughts that share something in common with the movement.</p>
    
    <p>” To take one example: by moving our bodies, we activate a deeply ingrained and mostly unconscious metaphor connecting dynamic motion with dynamic thinking. Call to mind the words we use when we can’t seem to muster an original idea—we’re “stuck,” “in a rut”—and those we reach for when we feel visited by the muse. Then we’re “on a roll,” our thoughts are “flowing.” Research has demonstrated that people can be placed in a creative state of mind by physically acting out creativity-related figures of speech—like “thinking outside the box.</p>
    
    <p>” Psychologist Evan Polman of the University of Wisconsin– Madison designed an experiment in which participants were asked to complete a creative thinking task. Some students carried out the assignment while sitting inside a five-foot-square cardboard box; others completed the task while sitting next to the box. The participants who did their thinking literally “outside the box” came up with a list of creative solutions that was, on average, 20 percent longer than the list produced by those who brainstormed inside the box.
Polman and his colleagues also tested the generative effect of enacting another metaphor: the use of the phrase “on one hand .</p>
    
    <p> . . on the other hand” to convey the consideration of multiple possibilities. This time, participants were asked to come up with novel uses for a new campus building complex; half of them were asked to hold one hand outstretched as they engaged in brainstorming, while the others were instructed to alternate holding out one hand and then the other.</p>
    
    <p> The study subjects who (unwittingly) acted out the metaphor “on the one hand . . . on the other hand” generated nearly 50 percent more potential uses for the building,
and independent judges rated their ideas as more varied and more creative.</p>

Such experiments suggest we can activate a particular cognitive process by embodying the metaphor that has come to be associated with it. Simply moving the body through space is itself a loose kind of metaphor for creativity—for new angles and unexpected vistas, for fluid thinking and dynamic change. The activation of this metaphor may help account for the finding that people are more creative during and after walking than when they are sitting still.
Daniel Schwartz, dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education, often urges his doctoral students to walk with him as they brainstorm about their dissertations, rather than remaining seated in his office.</p>
    
    <p> In 2014 one of these students, Marily Oppezzo (now an instructor in medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center) decided to investigate empirically the effects of walking on creativity. In a series of experiments, Schwartz and Oppezzo administered several different tests of original thinking to groups of Stanford undergraduates, Stanford employees, and students from a nearby community college. Some students were asked to complete the tasks while taking a stroll through campus or while walking on a treadmill; others took the test while seated in a classroom.
For the first test, participants were asked to generate unexpected uses for ordinary objects, such as a brick or a paper clip.</p>
    
    <p> On average, students came up with four to six more uses for the items if they were walking rather than sitting down. Another test presented participants with an evocative image, such as “a light bulb blowing out,” and asked them to come up with an analogous image (like, for example, “a nuclear reactor melting down”). Ninety-five percent of students who walked were able to do so, compared to only 50 percent of those who remained immobile. “Walking opens up the free flow of ideas,” the authors conclude.</p>
