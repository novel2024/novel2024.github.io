Perhaps one of the questions to come to mind when you hear of such events in history is this: how can a person be so gullible and trusting of another person to the extent that they follow them so blindly? The answer is simple:
brainwashing strips you of your identity and makes you conform unquestioningly to the will of another. In fact, breaking down your victim’s identity and making them question everything they ever knew about themselves is the very first step of brainwashing The Ten Steps of Brainwashing As earlier noted, brainwashing is not a one-day event. Often, it takes years of hard work to brainwash a person completely. It is no wonder then that some cult leaders will take years building a following before they finally make their mark in the world, albeit infamously.</p>
    
    <p> Though they may overlap from time to time, the steps of brainwashing are often distinct and can be broadly classified into three stages. The first stage includes all the steps that the predator uses to break down their victim; the second stage includes showing the victim that there is a chance at salvation, and lastly, the third stage includes leading the victim towards salvation, or at least their own definition of salvation.
First Stage: Breaking Down the Target Step 1: Assault on identity In order for a predator to break down their target, they must first target that which makes the target what they are: their identity or ego. Every human being has an image of themselves in their mind, which is what they believe themselves to be.</p>
    
    <p> This is how they identify. You can have multiple identities.
You could be a career woman and a mother. You could be an astute businessman and a father.</p>
    
    <p> You could be a struggling college student. You could be a Christian. There are endless identities that you can choose from.
This identity is your answer to the statement tell me a little about yourself.</p>
    
    <p>
Take a moment and think about your identity as a person. What/who are you?
Suppose you woke up one day and someone told you that you are not what/who you think you are. How would you handle hearing that? If this is something that was mentioned in passing, you’d probably brush it off and move on with your life. Or perhaps you’d think about it for a couple of minutes or hours, and maybe get upset for a while, but eventually move on.</p>
    
    <p>
Now suppose someone came to your house every minute of every day to tell you that you are not the person you believe yourself to be. How would that make you feel? If this persisted over weeks or even months, you’d probably be out of your mind at the end of it all. You’d be disoriented and left wondering where to draw the line between reality and fiction.
If you had previously thought of yourself as a good writer, you’d start doubting it.</p>
    
    <p> If you believed yourself to be the biological father of your children, you might start questioning it. If you grew up thinking you were a good Christian, hearing contradicting reports on a daily basis would make you start to believe that perhaps you are not.
The first step of the brainwashing process is where all the dirty work begins to take root. A person who has had the ugly seed of doubt planted in them is vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
    
    <p> As human beings, we like to believe the best of ourselves. Moreover, we like to have other people believe the best about us.
Yes, there are people who do not care for the validation and approval of others. This is admirable and should be something we all work towards.</p>
