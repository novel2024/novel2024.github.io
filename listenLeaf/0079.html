    <p> You have to work on paper and this is the paper. Okay?” Feynman wasn’t (just) being crotchety. He was defending a view of the act of creation that would be codified four decades later in Andy Clark’s theory of the extended mind. Writing about this very episode, Clark argues that, indeed,
“Feynman was actually thinking on the paper.</p>
    
    <p> The loop through pen and paper is part of the physical machinery responsible for the shape of the flow of thoughts and ideas that we take, nonetheless, to be distinctively those of Richard Feynman.” We often ignore or dismiss these loops, preferring to focus on what goes on in the brain—but this incomplete perspective leads us to misunderstand our own minds. Writes Clark, “It is because we are so prone to think that the mental action is all, or nearly all, on the inside, that we have developed sciences and images of the mind that are, in a fundamental sense, inadequate.” We will “begin to see ourselves aright,” he suggests, only when we recognize the role of material things in our thinking—when we correct the errors and omissions of the brainbound perspective, and “put brain, body, and world together again.</p>
    
    <p>” PART III THINKING WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS 7 Thinking with Experts GERMANY HAS LONG BEEN Europe’s economic powerhouse; among the nation’s many strengths, observers often single out its distinctive system of apprenticeships. Every year, about half a million young Germans move directly from high school into well-designed apprentice programs operated inside companies, where they learn technical skills such as welding, machining, and electrical engineering. This deeply entrenched system has for decades enabled Germany’s manufacturing sector to thrive. But as in other Western countries, the dominance of industry in Germany is giving way to a more information-centric economy, creating demand for skills like computer programming.</p>
    
    <p> This change has brought new challenges, and students and instructors have struggled to adapt.
At the University of Potsdam—a school of some twenty thousand students,
located outside Berlin—a key step for undergraduates who want a career in tech is a course on theoretical computer science. Yet year after year, the rate at which students failed the course was stunning: as high as 60 percent. The problem seemed related to the course’s highly abstract content; sitting passively in lectures, students simply weren’t grasping the meaning of concepts like “parsing algorithms,” “closure properties,” and “linear-bounded automata.</p>
    
    <p>” Then a group of computer science professors hit upon a solution, one that harked back to Germany’s historical strength. Led by Potsdam professor Christoph Kreitz, the faculty members reimagined the class as an apprenticeship, albeit of a special sort. The course was reorganized around making the internal thought processes of computer scientists “visible” to students—as visible as a carpenter fitting a joint or a tailor cutting a bolt of cloth.
This is what’s known as a cognitive apprenticeship, a term coined by Allan Collins, now a professor emeritus of education at Northwestern University.</p>
    
    <p> In a 1991 article written with John Seely Brown and Ann Holum, Collins noted a crucial difference between traditional apprenticeships and modern schooling: in the former, “learners can see the processes of work,” while in the latter, “the processes of thinking are often invisible to both the students and the teacher.” Collins and his coauthors identified four features of apprenticeship that could be adapted to the demands of knowledge work: modeling, or demonstrating the task while explaining it aloud; scaffolding, or structuring an opportunity for the learner to try the task herself; fading, or gradually withdrawing guidance as the learner becomes more proficient; and coaching, or helping the learner through difficulties along the way.
Christoph Kreitz and his colleagues incorporated these features of traditional apprenticeships into their course redesign, reducing the amount of time students spent in lectures and increasing the length and frequency of small-group sessions led by tutors. In these sessions, students didn’t listen to a description of computer science concepts, or engage in a discussion about the work performed by computer scientists; they actually did the work themselves, under the tutors’ close supervision.</p>
    
    <p> The results of these changes were dramatic: the proportion of students failing the course shrank from above 60 percent to less than 10 percent.
The kind of shift Kreitz and his colleagues made at Potsdam is one that many of us will contemplate in coming years. All over the world, in every sector and specialty, education and work are less and less about executing concrete tasks and more and more about engaging in internal thought processes. As Allan Collins observed, these processes are largely inaccessible to both novice and expert: the novice doesn’t yet know the material well enough, while the expert knows it so well that it has become second nature.</p>
    
    <p> This reality means that if we are to extend our thinking with others’ expertise, we must find better ways of effecting an accurate transfer of knowledge from one mind to another. Cognitive apprenticeships are one such method; we’ll explore several others in this chapter,
starting with an approach that boasts both a long historical pedigree and an increasingly robust foundation in scientific research. So what if it makes us a bit uneasy?
