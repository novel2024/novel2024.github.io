    <p> Both behavioral and physiological synchrony, in turn,
generate greater cognitive synchrony. Emerging research even points to the existence of “neural synchrony”—the intriguing finding that when a group of individuals are thinking well together, their patterns of brain activity come to resemble one other’s. Though we may imagine ourselves as separate beings, our minds and bodies have many ways of bridging the gaps.
 A HOST OF LABORATORY experiments, as well as countless instances of real-world rituals, show that it’s possible to activate the group mind—to flip the hive switch, as it were—by “hacking” behavioral synchrony and physiological arousal.</p>
    
    <p> The key lies in creating a certain kind of group experience: real-time encounters in which people act and feel together in close physical proximity. Yet our schools and companies are increasingly doing just the opposite. Aided by technology, we are creating individual, asynchronous, atomized experiences for students and employees—from personalized “playlists” of academic lessons to go-at-your-own-pace online training modules. Then we wonder why our groups don’t cohere, why group work is often frustrating and disappointing, and why thinking with groups doesn’t extend our intelligence.</p>
    
    <p>
Why is our current approach so wrongheaded? It assumes that information is information, however it is encountered; that tasks are tasks, no matter how we take them on. But in fact, the new science of the group mind is demonstrating that we think differently—and often better—when we think as part of a close- knit group rather than as individuals. This is particularly the case regarding our attention and our motivation. The nature of these two states is altered in meaningful ways when we enter them collectively instead of alone.</p>
    
    <p>
First, attention: the phenomenon that psychologists call “shared attention” occurs when we focus on the same objects or information at the same time as others. The awareness that we are focusing on a particular stimulus along with other people leads our brains to endow that stimulus with special significance,
tagging it as especially important. We then allocate more mental bandwidth to that material, processing it more deeply; in scientists’ terms, we award it “cognitive prioritization.” In a world of too much information, we use shared attention to help us figure out what to focus on, then direct our mental resources toward the object that the spotlight of shared attention has illuminated.</p>
    
    <p> As a result of these (mostly automatic) processes, we learn things better when we attend to them with other people. We remember things better when we attend to them with other people. And we’re more likely to act upon information that has been attended to along with other people.
The practice of engaging in shared attention starts in infancy.</p>
    
    <p> By nine months,
a baby begins to look in the direction in which an adult turns her head. Infants will gaze longer at what the grownups around them appear to be looking at, and they are more likely to recognize objects that they earlier jointly attended to with a caregiver than objects they attended to alone. In this subtle and mostly unconscious way, parents are continually instructing their offspring on what is important, what merits attention, and what can be safely ignored.
By one year of age, a baby will reliably look in the direction of an adult’s gaze, even absent the turning of the adult’s head.</p>
    
    <p> Such gaze-following is made easier by the fact that people have visible whites of the eyes. Humans are the only primates so outfitted, an exceptional status that has led scientists to propose the “cooperative eye hypothesis”—the theory that our eyes evolved to support cooperative social interactions. “Our eyes see, but they are also meant to be seen,” notes science writer Ker Than.
The ability to experience the world from a shared perspective is an evolved adaptation that grants humans an unequalled capacity for coordinating thought and behavior with other members of their species.</p>
    
    <p> Shared attention, and the increased cognitive resources devoted to information that is mutually attended to, produces greater overlap in group members’ “mental models” of a problem,
and therefore smoother cooperation while solving it. It is, in a sense, what makes all human achievements possible—from jointly maneuvering a piece of furniture through a narrow doorway to collaboratively designing and launching a rocket sent to the moon. And it starts with babies following the direction of our eyes.
Shared attention remains important among adults, though it plays a different role than in the interactions of caregivers and children.</p>
