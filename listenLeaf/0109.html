    <p> Water conducts heat very well.
This is also why damp clothes feel colder and why staying dry is important for staying warm. Conversely, if you want to cool down, sweat or add water exogenously. Causing water to evaporate will cool you even faster.</p>
    
    <p>
Evaporation can be encouraged by convecting away the air with a high relative humidity around your skin. This is the basis of the swamp cooler, (a swamp cooler is a simple system, so you can build your own; it only works where the relative humidity is low) which is useful if you can't sweat enough on your own. If you can, a fan will do. These days most fans are electric, but you can get a hand fan.</p>
    
    <p> You should also wear loose clothing to aid in convection when you move. Conversely, in cool temperatures, wear constricting clothes, like neck ties and cuffs, to seal off air movements.
Given standard-sized rooms, focus on heating and cooling the body rather than the room. Heating unused rooms isn't harmonious with financial independence as money is being wasted; nor are large rooms.</p>
    
    <p>
If you have the choice, go with smaller rooms. Small (100sqft/person),
well-insulated rooms can be heated and cooled at almost no cost; consider this along with future projections of the cost of heating oil. It may be useful to know that should the central heating be switched off for whatever reason,
you can approximate a small room by pitching a tent in your living room and sleeping in that.
Without the benefit of small rooms, heating and cooling means changing habits to be more in tune with the seasons--that is, letting the room temperature follow the outside temperature more closely.</p>
    
    <p> The barrier here is that modern people live in bubbles, only spending trivial amounts of time outside their offices, houses, cars, and shopping centers. Modern sedentary habits have almost eliminated physiological advantages and adaptation. How to dress and behave for seasons and weather have been forgotten, and so people own improper clothing which is uncomfortable outside the range of "modern room temperature." By wearing the right clothes (see Clothes) and changing a few habits, it takes about two weeks to adapt physiologically.</p>
    
    <p>
Clothes In a business setting, men wear suits suitable for unheated or poorly heated rooms in a cold temperate climate, namely England, where the business suit originated. Because of tradition, businessmen and office workers wear woolen two- or three-piece suits regardless of the climate they live in, and office buildings are air-conditioned to an English climate so that workers may comfortably over-dress even if the weather outside calls for t-shirts. Dress more compatibly with the weather and save money on trying to change the temperature (see Heating and cooling); this is possible if you're not subject to dress code restrictions, either by working from home (see Telecommuting and work) or working in an occupation where your attire must not conform to customer expectations or affect shareholder profits. Like with heating and cooling (see Heating and cooling), clothing should follow the seasons.</p>
    
    <p> I wear wool suits during the winter; they're very comfortable and last a long time.
Fixing up a wardrobe Wardrobes often show a history of fashion, sales, sudden inspirations (good and bad), and changing weight. It's apparently not unusual to budget for clothes as a recurrent expense just to keep up with fashion and maintain a sufficient selection of outfits. As a result, clothes are bought cheap (sometimes extra is paid for branding) and considered disposable.</p>
    
    <p> However,
clothes should be considered durable goods (see Depreciation schedules) and tools to serve a purpose. This means that an item must be carefully considered (if in doubt, always postpone). It must look good, fit the body,
fit the temperature, not be sticky nor restrictive. If it doesn't allow a comfortable five mile walk or standing around outside and inside for one hour while wearing it, it fails.</p>
