    <p> The preponderance of this is of course company-dependent, but seems somewhat proportional to the size of the company and the amount of bureaucratic procedure. But I don't think it's inaccurate to suggest that the atmosphere is much like high school or college.
However, being paid on salary can lead to less satisfaction since the effort-reward connection is broken when the employee realizes that he gets paid the same amount regardless of how much or how little he works.
Realizing that pay often has more to do with negotiation skills, politics, or tenure than productivity or even responsibility can be depressing.</p>
    
    <p> It divides the workforce into three kinds of people, popularly known as work horses,
show horses, and horses' asses. In particular, some will realize that they can get further ahead through office politics and career management than conscientious work, some will realize that showing up and doing the minimum amount of work will pay equally well, and some will not realize either one. I'll let you guess which horse is which.
Traditionally, salaried work entails some form of continuous career where breaks are frowned upon.</p>
    
    <p> Furthermore, it'll be very hard to negotiate leaves of several weeks to take vacations or work on other things. There may be noncompete agreements to sign or other kinds of golden handcuffs and behavioral restrictions.
For these reasons, and because it tends to pay well due to the large number of hours worked, salaried work is the preferred method for accumulating a fund for financial independence (see Financial independence and investing). There's plenty of advice out there, the most important piece of which is, in my opinion, to pursue something you're good at rather than something you're passionate about--these are not necessarily the same thing--and consider the typical placement rates (unemployment levels), and in particular the cost of any kind of educational requirement, using either a discounted cash flow or internal rate of return analysis to see if it's worthwhile.</p>
    
    <p>
Nonsalaried work Nonsalaried work though it may involve contracting with a single employer, technically a client, shouldn't be considered employment (see this figure), but it still qualifies as a job. Such a job involves either providing services or making products directly (see The working man) or involves running a business turning assets into income (see The businessman). In both cases, the connection between effort and reward is readily apparent and work thus provides a greater amount of satisfaction. In particular,
working extra (overtime) is compensated.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, working less (undertime) isn't compensated.
Nonsalaried work is therefore one level closer to reality in the sense that if no action is taken, no compensation appears. Since the work is, in a sense, more real, credentials and politics become less important. It'll be easier to tell a good job from a bad job.</p>
    
    <p> In addition, in some cases it'll be possible for you to tell exactly how your contribution added value. For example, you bought 1,000 pens for $1 each, presented them in a store and sold them for $3, or you knitted a sweater and sold it, or you repaired someone's moped. In a larger system, it'll often be hard to tell exactly what the point of those Form 32B-4s you spent all day filing is in terms of the operation of the company. It's interesting to note that even if the latter pays better, it can often be less satisfying due to the lack of control or apparent purpose.</p>
    
    <p>
Of course it's also possible that you have been assigned to file Form 32B-4s for some company as an outsourced contractor. In this case, there may not be any particular satisfaction in doing such a job. Sometimes this kind of piecework is paid on an hourly basis. This happens when it's hard to estimate the price of individual pieces because they're all unique.</p>
    
    <p> Lawyer's fees, filing reports, and editing papers comes to mind. This arrangement suffers the same problems as salaried compensation. However, since hours are strictly recorded, there's no longer any pay for water cooler talk, and working under such terms would be considered less "cushy" than doing the same job under salaried conditions.
In many countries, many social services, such as health care, are provided for by the government.</p>
