    <p> This is partially or perhaps the exclusive reason so many people take up marathon running. Passing exams or keeping up a grade point average develops another kind of character and this is why businesses are interested in students with good grades; aside from the grades serving as a legal proxy in lieu of intelligence tests, employers know that over-achievers follow and take instruction well. Indeed, there is a common confusion between an education and a degree. A degree is something you get at college which can be used as an entry ticket to the white-collar job market.</p>
    
    <p>
Similarly, a certification is something that can be used as an entry ticket to the blue-collar job market. However, a character transformation can be attained pretty much anywhere, whether in a classroom, laboratory, job, the Peace Corps, the military, or the swim team.
In fact, education is very different from training. Training is what you know whereas education is who you are as a person.</p>
    
    <p> As a result, people receiving the same training can end up with very different educations. I do believe there is a certain moral aspect to education. It forms one's character,
good or bad. In that sense, education is a form of indoctrination aimed to produce a certain attitude.</p>
    
    <p> This means that education works well if it reinforces and polishes an existing natural attitude, but it can be a painful experience if one is naturally incompatible with the indoctrination. This is why I don't believe that one education fits all. Ever notice how many successful business leaders are college dropouts? It did not take them long to realize that college was not helping them to become leaders and entrepreneurs. This is because a college education creates followers, or people who are habituated to being handed a bunch of instructions and then delivering a product, from years of practice.</p>
    
    <p> It doesn't matter what the form of the product is--that is, whether it's an essay or a math problem. The important parts are the assignments, the deadlines, the grades and the annual reviews; a structure that is repeated at the employee level in corporations. I have found that I don't make a very happy salary man--I should probably have gotten a clue from the fact that I was taking courses based on personal interest rather than strategically choosing the easy courses to optimize my grade point average--but I have, however, found that I make for a very happy Renaissance man. Like me, you may have gotten an education that wasn't compatible with your training.</p>
    
    <p> It may be that you don't know your type like I didn't know mine. Many confuse who they are with what they do! Some get an education for whatever reason and yet are not completely transformed into the intended result, just as children often don't do what their parents tell them to, but rather become the opposite in a counterreaction. So it will be for education. This book is my contribution to your education.</p>
