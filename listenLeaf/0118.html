    <p> From several stories up, an observer could see the change in Austin’s students: they were at last getting outside their own heads.
Conclusion SOME FIFTEEN YEARS after Elliot Aronson ventured into the restive classrooms of Austin, Texas, his twenty-five-year-old son set out to follow his father’s professional path. The younger man arrived on the campus of Princeton University to pursue his PhD in 1986. But Joshua Aronson soon encountered an unanticipated obstacle to achieving his aim of becoming a social psychologist:
he found himself struck dumb whenever he met with his graduate school adviser,
a distinguished scholar named Edward Ellsworth Jones.</p>
    
    <p> “I was totally intimidated by him,” Aronson recounts. “I’d walk into his office as prepared as I could be, but without fail, I would lose ten or fifteen IQ points the minute I came through the door. They would get sucked out of my head just by being in the presence of this person.” The humiliation of standing, dull-witted and tongue-tied, in Professor Jones’s office affected him so deeply that it shaped the course of his burgeoning career.</p>
    
    <p>
Less than a decade later, as a junior professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Aronson helped design a study that became one of the most influential ever conducted in psychology—“a modern classic,” as it’s been called. The paper described for the first time a phenomenon that he and his coauthor, Claude Steele, named “stereotype threat”: a temporary condition that saps the brainpower of those affected, rendering them effectively less intelligent.
Aronson and Steele’s experiments demonstrated that members of groups stereotyped as academically inferior—such as female students enrolled in math and science courses, or African American and Latino students attending college —score lower on tests of intellectual ability when made conspicuously aware of their gender or ethnicity.
Stereotype threat has since become a crucial concept within psychology,
guiding researchers’ inquiries into why women are underrepresented in STEM fields, for example, and why well-prepared minority high school graduates may still struggle in college.</p>
    
    <p> These investigations are rooted in a more general truth,
says Aronson, one that that applies to every one of us. Intelligence is not “a fixed lump of something that’s in our heads,” he explains. Rather, “it’s a transaction”:
a fluid interaction among our brains, our bodies, our spaces, and our relationships. The capacity to think intelligently emerges from the skillful orchestration of these internal and external elements.</p>
    
    <p> And indeed, studies have shown that such mental extensions can help us think more effectively when confronted with a challenge like stereotype threat. Using “cognitive reappraisal” to reinterpret bodily signals, as we learned to do in chapter 1, can head off the performance-suppressing effects of anxiety. Adding “cues of belonging” to the physical environment, of the kind we explored in chapter 5, can generate a sense of psychological ease that’s conducive to intelligent thought. And carefully structuring the expert feedback offered to a “cognitive apprentice,” as we learned about in chapter 7, can instill the confidence necessary to overcome self-doubt.</p>
    
    <p>
With a wry smile, Joshua Aronson (currently an associate professor of psychology at New York University) refers to his stammering state when encountering his adviser as “conditional stupidity.” Knowing what we do about mental extensions and how they work, we are now able to assemble the conditions for intelligence, even brilliance. In this book we’ve looked intently at one extension at a time: interoceptive signals, movements, and gestures; natural spaces, built spaces, and the “space of ideas”; experts, peers, and groups. But evidence suggests that extensions are most powerful when they are employed in combination, incorporated into mental routines that draw on the full range of extra-neural resources we have at hand.</p>
    
    <p>
The skilled use of extensions is a proficiency that has gone largely unrecognized and uncultivated by our schools and workplaces, and it was long ignored by researchers in psychology, education, and management. But some general principles of effective extending are now clearly discernible, implicit in the more recent research we’ve covered in previous chapters. Let’s take up, in turn, three sets of such principles—three lenses through which to view the project of extending the mind.
The first set of principles lays out some habits of mind we would do well to adopt, starting with this one: whenever possible, we should offload information,
externalize it, move it out of our heads and into the world.</p>
    
    <p> Throughout this book we’ve encountered many examples of offloading and have become familiar with its manifold benefits. It relieves us of the burden of keeping a host of details “in mind,” thereby freeing up mental resources for more demanding tasks, like problem solving and idea generation. It also produces for us the “detachment gain,” whereby we can inspect with our senses, and often perceive anew, an image or idea that once existed only in the imagination.
In its most straightforward form, offloading is the simple act of putting our thoughts down on paper—simple, but often skipped over in a world that values doing things in our heads.</p>
