    <p> Casomorphin originates in the cow's liver, gets transferred to its bloodstream, and ends up in its milk. Casomorphin is particularly concentrated in cheese, which is a milk product from which water, whey, and lactose have been removed. This explains why cheese is very addictive. It's perhaps not surprising that the food industry spends a lot of money hawking their products.</p>
    
    <p> Something to keep in mind is that if a product needs advertising to tell you it is good for you, it probably isn't. I'll leave sugar addiction and various other food addictions as a research project for the reader (see Physiological), but this does explain why changing one's diet can be very hard.
Eating like a farmer Most animals don't have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Why do we? The standard three meals a day model is very useful for anyone engaging in heavy manual labor like farmwork or early industrial work.</p>
    
    <p> Obviously,
work can't be stopped all the time for a snack break, but it's impossible to eat enough in the morning to last for an entire day of hard work. Three meals are thus a good compromise. Breakfast would fuel four hours of work, lunch would fuel another four hours of work and dinner would fuel eight hours of nonwork and eight hours of sleep, nominally. For people engaged in light manual labor, this diet is a problem, particularly if highly glycemic foods are eaten at lunch resulting in an insulin spike that drops blood sugar levels precipitously.</p>
    
    <p> Not only can this make a person hungry,91 but the high level of insulin also makes one very tired. A quick way to fix this is to quickly engage in intensive workout--for example, spend 20 minutes doing all-out HIIT (see High intensity interval training). Another option is to store the excess energy around the midsection and grab a cup of coffee or one of the heavily marketed energy drinks.
Eating like an athlete Recently, a diet of six meals a day has gained popularity.</p>
    
    <p> This diet is inspired by full-time athletes, especially bodybuilders, who, in contrast to full-time workers, do have the option of taking a snack break. Using blood sugar directly from the intestines and having them refueled every other hour by a meal is easier that relying on blood sugar from the liver, which gets depleted (also known as "hitting the wall" or "tanking") after a couple hours of hard work. As a consequence, the body will start producing insulin on a sustained basis. Insulin is required to bring the sugar into the cells, where it is used.</p>
    
    <p> Of course, there's the problem of missing a meal. In this case,
insulin levels will remain high in anticipation of sugar, and if the sugar doesn't arrive on schedule, the relatively elevated levels of insulin will drive blood sugar down and make the person very hungry. This is made worse if compounded by a workout, in which case hitting the wall comes much sooner than it otherwise would. It's very important if on this diet to eat constantly.</p>
    
    <p> It's a good thing too, because digesting food actually requires a substantial amount of energy, also known as the thermic effect. Generally less refined foods like vegetables and meats require up to one-third of their caloric value just to digest them. Refined foods like white flour, sugars, and fat require almost nothing. This is great news for the athlete but bad news for regular folks, who don't work out 4-6 hours a day in pursuit of muscle mass.</p>
    
    <p> In this case, one must eat very small meals and stay clear of cookies and other highly processed foods. In my opinion, this offers few benefits for a normal person, who do just fine on liver glycogen without the need to "turbocharge" the blood sugar by continuous fueling. Eating six meals a day also makes for a lot of hassle, such as keeping track of calories, planning meals, the problem of missing a meal and the resulting hunger pangs.
Eating like a warrior Culturally speaking, we have been programmed to believe that an empty feeling in the stomach is undesirable and a full belly is good.</p>
