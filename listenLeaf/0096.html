    <p> The results are predictable: boredom, distraction, disengagement, even acting out. Of course, we can’t simply allow adolescents to attend to their social lives all day.
But we can leverage their burgeoning sociability in the service of learning the material they need to learn. How to do this? One effective technique is to involve them in highly social relationships in which academic content is also front and center: that is, engage them in teaching others.</p>
    
    <p>
Given their well-advertised ambivalence about school, deputizing teenagers to act as teachers may seem like a questionable prescription. But that’s just it:
While our species and its young did not evolve to care about the Pythagorean theorem or the War of 1812, we did evolve to educate others about the vital arcana of our particular tribe. (Think of how much informal “teaching” of adolescent social norms goes on in the cafeteria or the student lounge.) As teachers, human beings are naturals; we are born to instruct others and to learn from them.</p>
    
    <p> Evidence of teaching has been found in the archaeological record reaching back hundreds of thousands of years, and the act of teaching has been observed in every human culture around the world, including the hunter-gatherer tribes that live today in a fashion similar to that of our ancient forebears.
The “teaching instinct” manifests just as reliably among modern people like us. In the course of everyday interactions, we unconsciously offer cues to others —eye contact, a change in our tone of voice—that signal our intent to instruct;
these cues in turn induce our social partners to become more receptive to the information we have to convey. Such signaling begins at birth: mothers and fathers of newborn babies immediately start speaking to their infants in “parentese,” a distinctively high-pitched, slowed-down, exaggerated way of talking.</p>
    
    <p> Research has found that hearing parentese helps infants and toddlers learn new words more readily than hearing ordinary speech. Before too long,
children themselves are engaging in instruction; teaching behavior has been observed among toddlers as young as three and a half years of age.
Across the lifespan, engagement with other people orients us toward taking in new information—but this reflexive adjustment may happen only if we encounter those people in the flesh. In a study using fNIRS brain-scanning technology, a team of researchers at Yale University found that an area of the social brain was activated when adult participants looked directly into one another’s eyes, but not when they gazed at the eyes of others recorded on video.</p>
    
    <p>
“Eye contact opens the gate between the perceptual systems of two individuals,
and information flows,” says Joy Hirsch, the Yale neuroscientist who led the study. Another factor that seems to “gate,” or initiate, the process of learning is contingent communication: social exchanges in which the utterances of one partner are directly responsive to what the other has said. When contingent communication is absent, learning may simply fail to occur. A particularly striking example: toddlers under the age of two and a half readily learn new words and actions from a responsive adult but pick up almost nothing from prerecorded instruction delivered on a screen—a phenomenon that researchers call the “video deficit.</p>
    
    <p>” Humans learn best from other (live) humans. Perhaps more surprising, people learn from teaching other people—often more than the pupils themselves absorb.
Consider this finding: firstborn children have an IQ that is on average 2.3 points higher than that of their younger brothers and sisters.</p>
    
    <p> After disconfirming several potential explanations, such as better nutrition or differential parental treatment,
researchers concluded that firstborn children’s higher IQs stem from a simple fact of family life: older siblings engage in teaching younger ones. Outside the family, laboratory research and real-world programs consistently show that engaging students in tutoring their peers has benefits for all involved, and especially for the ones doing the teaching. Why would the act of teaching produce learning—for the teacher? The answer is that teaching is a deeply social act, one that initiates a set of powerful cognitive, attentional, and motivational processes that have the effect of changing the way the teacher thinks.
One such process kicks in even before the tutoring session begins: students who learn information in preparation for teaching someone else review the material more intensively and organize it more thoroughly in their own minds than do students who are learning the same information in order to take a test.</p>
    
    <p>
For social creatures like us, the prospect of engaging in an interpersonal interaction—with all of its potential for feeling admired or embarrassed—is far more motivating than the relatively anonymous activity of supplying written answers on an exam. Likewise, social interactions with other people alter our physiological state in ways that enhance learning, generating a state of energized alertness that sharpens attention and reinforces memory. Students who are studying on their own experience no such boost in physiological arousal, and so easily become bored or distracted; they may turn on music or open up Instagram to give themselves a dose of the human emotion and social stimulation they’re missing.
More learning happens for the tutor in the course of teaching.</p>
