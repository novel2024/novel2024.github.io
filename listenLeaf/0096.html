The money flow from the latter will stay negative for longer, as the aim and required level of mastery for profit in creative design is higher than in service and repair.
Skills that are likely worthwhile include woodworking, electric work (wiring, soldering, etching print boards), engine work, vehicle maintenance,
cooking, preserving, clothes repair (mending, hand and machine sewing),
and house maintenance/handyman work.
Reusing Build things out of your environment! Find out what kind of utility something provides (see Building blocks). Everybody is familiar with the college student bookshelf made out of a few boards and concrete blocks.</p>
    
    <p>
You can build a bed frame out of wood pallets, or you can build a table out of a large phone cable drum. You can get food containers from store-bought products: Lunch meat is sometimes sold in reusable plastic containers.
Mustard is sold in drinking cups--use a permanent marker to draw lines and it becomes a measuring cup. Olives are sold in what could be spice containers.</p>
    
    <p> A fork is a whisk. A plate is a cutting board with the right knife (serrated tomato/utility knife). You can make clothes hangers out of cardboard boxes. You can store clothes on hangers or in suitcases or trunks.</p>
    
    <p>
A nice trunk is a table. Laundry goes in big plastic bags. A towel, or clothes in a pillow case (or t-shirt) becomes a pillow. A zipped sleeping bag is a hay box for your pressure cooker.</p>
    
    <p> An unzipped sleeping bag becomes a duvet. The liner becomes a blanket. The best way to think up new inventive ideas is to imagine being on a desert island with no other option than to create a solution out of the materials at hand. This requires conquering the tendency to go out and buy the known commercial solution, but with time it can be overcome.</p>

The fixer-upper or "holding" Most consumables and many capital assets suffer depreciation and lose resale value year after year. High-quality items, particularly if they involve old technology that has become canonical--that is, it can't be improved-- don't lose value and may even gain value, effectively functioning as an inflation hedge. Some examples include revolvers (but not pistols), wood- working and machining tools, mechanical watches, tube amplifiers, wool coats, knives, fishing reels, etc.
For example, a new high-quality tenon saw may cost $145.</p>
    
    <p> Since there is little difference functionally between a new high-quality saw and an old high-quality saw, the used price may be $130. All things being equal, the price after several years will still be $130. If you managed to fix it up--for instance, by refurbishing the handle or sharpening the blade--it may fetch more. If you got some rust spots on it, it may lose value.</p>
    
    <p> Subtracting the purchasing price from the sales price should come to a small amount. It's interesting to note that this amount is comparable to or smaller than the price of a cheap new $20 saw, which will only fetch $1 if you sell it. This is also more environmentally and financially sustainable: Sustainability comes from lifetime ownership--not necessarily by the same person--of one quality item instead of 10 disposable items.
Doing some research and plotting prices as a function of product age creates a depreciation scatter plot.</p>
