    <p> “When we think of prejudice, most of us think of it as a problem of people,” says Mary Murphy, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Indiana University Bloomington. But, she points out, inequalities of experience and outcome are also generated by features of the “organizational setting,” of which the built environment is a significant part. Murphy and her colleagues have advanced a theory of “prejudiced places,” which they define as places that “unequally tax the emotions, physiology, cognitive function, and performance of some groups more than others.” When we regard prejudice as a property of people alone—as an entity that exists inside individuals’ heads—we fail to see the full picture of how bias operates within institutions, and we miss out on opportunities to push back against it.</p>
    
    <p> According to what Murphy calls the “prejudice-in-places model,” systemic inequality will not be eradicated by identifying and rooting out a few bad actors who hold racist or sexist beliefs. Indeed, prejudice can be perpetuated by places even when the people within them are endeavoring to act in egalitarian ways. Precisely because physical places exert such a profound effect on the behavior of the people who work and learn within them, altering aspects of these spaces might offer the most effective route to reducing bias. Efforts to change people’s beliefs more directly may provoke resistance or resentment—and, in fact, research has repeatedly found unimpressive results for conventional diversity workshops and training sessions.</p>
    
    <p>
“Prejudiced places” might well have described the environments Sapna Cheryan encountered in the summer of 2001. Recently graduated from college,
Cheryan was interviewing for internships at tech firms located in California’s Bay Area. At one of the companies she visited, she found herself put off by a workspace that looked like a computer geek’s basement hangout: “the action figures, the Nerf guns, the soda cans stacked up to make a model of the Golden Gate Bridge,” as Cheryan recalls it now. The firm’s adherence to a very particular aesthetic seemed designed to promote an exclusive conception of its ideal employee—one that felt unwelcoming or even alienating to her, a young woman and person of color.</p>
    
    <p> Cheryan encountered a very different setting when interviewing at the software company Adobe; there, the workspace was bright and inviting. Cheryan accepted Adobe’s offer and stayed on at the firm for five years. Her next move was to a psychology PhD program at Stanford University,
where she enrolled with the aim of investigating how cues in the physical environment affect the way people think.
In an experiment she conducted while still a graduate student, Cheryan commandeered space in Stanford’s Gates Computer Science Building, creating what she called a “stereotypical” classroom and a “non-stereotypical” classroom.</p>
    
    <p>
The stereotypical classroom was filled with soda cans, books of science-fiction fantasy, and Star Trek and Star Wars posters. The non-stereotypical classroom featured accoutrements like nature posters, literary novels, and bottles of water.
After spending time in each room, undergraduates were surveyed about how interested they were in computer science and how well they thought they would perform in that discipline.
Following a few minutes in the stereotypical room, male students reported a high level of interest in pursuing computer science; female students indicated much less interest than their male counterparts.</p>
    
    <p> But after they spent time in the non-stereotypical room, women’s interest in computer science increased markedly—actually exceeding that of the men. Subsequent research by Cheryan has found that women exposed to a non-stereotypical classroom are more likely to predict that they will perform well in computer science courses, whereas men tend to predict that they will succeed regardless of which room they encounter.
That’s important, says Cheryan, because “we know from past work in psychology that how well you expect to do in a certain environment can determine how you actually perform.” Cheryan called the phenomenon documented in her study “ambient belonging,” defined as individuals’ sense of fit with a physical environment,
“along with a sense of fit with the people who are imagined to occupy that environment.</p>
    
    <p>” Ambient belonging, she proposed, “can be ascertained rapidly,
even from a cursory glance at a few objects.” In the research she has since produced, Cheryan has explored how ambient belonging can be enlarged and expanded—how a wider array of individuals can be induced to feel that crucial sense of “fit” in the environments in which they find themselves. The key, she says, is not to eliminate stereotypes but to diversify them—to convey the message that people from many different backgrounds can thrive in a given setting. Just such an effort was undertaken at the University of Washington,
where Cheryan is now a professor.</p>
    
    <p> UW revamped its computer science lab,
applying a fresh coat of paint, hanging new artwork, and arranging the seating to encourage more social interaction. Five years later, the proportion of undergraduate computer science degrees earned by women at UW reached 32 percent, higher than at any other flagship public university in the country.
Cheryan and others are now exploring how to create a sense of ambient belonging in online “spaces,” an example of extending technology with what we know to be true about physical spaces in the offline world. As is the case in “real life,” research finds that members of historically stigmatized groups are especially attuned to cues of exclusion that appear on digital platforms, such as online courses.</p>
