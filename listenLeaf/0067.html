    <p> Some goals involve getting or being healthy, while other goals are unhealthy. Indeed, if you map out a typical lifestyle, you will probably find a lot of counterproductivity. When a strong positive goal is countered by smaller negative goals, the result is friction. Friction produces waste (see Breaking out).</p>
    
    <p> Waste is prevalent in modern life. Just consider how many people drive. First the foot goes on the accelerator, then ten seconds later it goes on the brake, turning kinetic energy into waste heat. Then it goes back on the accelerator again to make up for the loss of speed.</p>
    
    <p>44 This results in poor gas mileage, as gas is used to heat up the brake pads, and equivalently poor life mileage when the same habits are used in everyday life. The same vehicle gets different gas mileages depending on the driver. Similarly, money gets different mileage depending on who is spending it. Conversely, if one positive goal is positively aligned with another positive goal, both goals benefit--the vectors point in the same direction in goal-space.</p>
    
    <p> To achieve such synergy, count up actions and list the effects. Effects may be positive or negative. Without synergy, negative effects will often cancel out positive effects or effects will be very scattered. Synergy concentrates the effects or goals.</p>
    
    <p> If you don't see a concentration of goals, you must change some of your behaviors and perhaps adopt new ones. For example, one of the things I had to do when starting on the path to early retirement was to replace my money-wasting and generally unproductive hobbies with hobbies there were free (see A modular design) and meaningful a) to not cause friction with my money saving, b) to provide meaning that was unrelated to work, and c) to learn new skills applicable to work (programming and writing).
A web of goals Having thus whittled down the number of available behaviors to a number of strategies that have mostly--optimally, exclusively--positive benefits, at least to the first order (but feel free to continue the exercise to higher orders), it is possible to use a simple form of systems thinking to assemble modules for an overall strategy. Yet unlike the traditional approach to systems theory, which aims to include an increasing amount of existing problems to be solved, generally in a reactive fashion, since the previous lack of systems thinking created them in the first place, the web of goals strategy aims to solve problems proactively by creating solutions that could be part of a wider strategy in the future.</p>
    
    <p>
Another way to think of this is that this strategy maximizes opportunities and changes according to which opportunities bear fruit. It's an opportunist's approach, which incidentally affirms the Renaissance man's position in the economic and social ecosystem. Yet another way to think of it is, like the name suggests, a web that catches, covers, and holds all the individual issues that are important to the person such as health, wealth, and wisdom.
Here is how to build the web: Each module will have one to several goals, namely the zeroth- and first-order effects of this figure.</p>
    
    <p> Here I just ignore higher order goals because their impact is typically small. Suppose the simple living module has "frugality," "savings," and "less clutter" as goals. These form a triangle in the figure. Now consider the career module which has "savings," "less clutter" due to being engaged in the career rather than buying rewards for suffering through a job, "resúmé-building," and "writing skills.</p>
    
    <p>" Those are four goals. This forms a square. The square shares two goals with the triangle, so draw them next to each other. Now add the exercise module.</p>
