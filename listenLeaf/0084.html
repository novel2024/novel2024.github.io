    <p> Less familiar is the brand Chux—and yet Chux was the first to arrive on the market, all the way back in 1935.
The problem: Chux were expensive, costing about 8.5 cents per diaper, at a time when parents could wash cloth diapers at a cost of 1.5 cents each.</p>
    
    <p> As a result, parents tended to use the product only when traveling, and Chux accounted for just 1 percent of the overall market for diapers. Procter & Gamble saw an opportunity. It imitated the basic idea behind Chux while intentionally addressing parents’ main objection to the product: its high price. When Pampers were rolled out nationwide in 1966—at a cost of three cents per diaper—P&G’s version was enthusiastically welcomed by parents.</p>
    
    <p>
Gerard Tellis and Peter Golder, both professors of marketing, conducted a historical analysis of fifty consumer product categories (including diapers, from which the Pampers versus Chux example was taken). Their results showed that the failure rate of “market pioneers” is an alarming 47 percent, while the mean market share they capture is only 10 percent. Far better than being first, Tellis and Golder concluded, is being what some have called a “fast second”: an agile imitator. Companies that capitalize on others’ innovations have “a minimal failure rate” and “an average market share almost three times that of market pioneers,” they found.</p>
    
    <p> In this category they include Timex, Gillette, and Ford,
firms that are often recalled—wrongly—as being first in their field.
Fourth, imitators are able to avoid being swayed by deception or secrecy: by working directly off of what others do, copiers get access to the best strategies in others’ repertoires. Competitors have no choice but to display what social scientists call “honest signals,” as they make decisions for themselves based on their own best interests. This is the case in every sort of contest—including sporting events like the America’s Cup, the high-profile sailing race.</p>
    
    <p>
Jan-Michael Ross and Dmitry Sharapov, both business professors at Imperial College London, studied the competitive interactions among yachts engaged in head-to-head races in the America’s Cup World Series. The researchers found that sailors often engaged in “covering,” or copying, the moves made by their rivals—especially when their boat was in the lead. It might seem surprising that sailors at the front of the pack would imitate those who are trailing, but Ross notes that such emulation makes sense: as long as the leaders do as their rivals behind them do, their lead will remain locked in place. Says Ross, “Our research challenges the common view that it’s only the laggards, the also-rans, who imitate.</p>
    
    <p>” Last, and perhaps most important, imitators save time, effort, and resources that would otherwise be invested in originating their own solutions. Research shows that the imitator’s costs are typically 60 to 75 percent of those borne by the innovator—and yet it is the imitator who consistently captures the lion’s share of financial returns.
Such findings, arriving from many directions, converge on the conclusion that imitation (if we can get past our aversion to it) opens up possibilities far beyond those that dwell inside our own heads. Engaging in effective imitation is like being able to think with other people’s brains—like getting a direct download of others’ knowledge and experience.</p>
    
    <p> But contrary to its reputation as a lazy cop- out, imitating well is not easy. It rarely entails automatic or mindless duplication.
Rather, it requires cracking a sophisticated code—solving what social scientists call the “correspondence problem,” or the challenge of adapting an imitated solution to the particulars of a new situation. Tackling the correspondence problem involves breaking down an observed solution into its constituent parts,
and then reassembling those parts in a different way; it demands a willingness to look past superficial features to the deeper reason why the original solution succeeded, and an ability to apply that underlying principle in a novel setting.</p>
    
    <p>
It’s paradoxical but true: imitating well demands a considerable degree of creativity.
 ADAPTING SOLUTION to problem was the tall task facing graduate nursing student Tess Pape in 1999. Pape could see the problem clearly enough: hospital patients were being harmed by medication errors committed by doctors and nurses. In that year, the Institute of Medicine had released a landmark report on patient safety, To Err Is Human.</p>
