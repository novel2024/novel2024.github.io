    <p> This can even turn into a substitute faith or a counterreaction of anti-materialism.
In our approach we are in fact aiming to build as much internal complexity into the strategy as possible. This should be clear from Strategy,
tactics, and guiding principles.
All this means that the total cost of stuff is much larger than its initial sticker price.</p>
    
    <p> Despite this, and perhaps due to short-sightedness or failure to take the systemic problem into account, owning many things is often confused with a high quality of life.57 Hence, reducing the amount of stuff is perceived as a major barrier. As a counter-reaction, a recent trend towards simplification is to own as few things as possible. Here, the barrier prevents owning more things.</p>
    
    <p> The optimal point is somewhere in the middle. In particular, it's important to realize that it's not the things themselves that are the problem; it is their side effects! So with this in mind...</p>
    
    <p>
Which things should I own?
Given these problems, things should:
have the appropriate quality and a low lifetime cost.
be durable.
be easy to dispose of either by selling, giving away, or trashing in a responsible manner.
be small and preferably lightweight.</p>
    
    <p>
be easy to make.
be serviceable locally and easy to maintain and repair, preferably by yourself.
As with most lists of optimal qualities, it's rare to be able to satisfy all criteria. Criteria must therefore be prioritized.</p>
    
    <p> For the purposes of extreme early retirement or financial independence, the most important criteria is having a low lifetime cost, which usually implies a relatively high level of durability and having the appropriate quality. The most expensive tool in the box is the one you never use, but many times there is also a temptation to get, say, a shop-quality tool, even if the tool isn't used daily like it would be in a shop. For commonly used items, a higher quality tends to pay off in the long run. Surprisingly, disposability is quite important.</p>
    
    <p> If you buy things that can be sold again at a price which will recover most of your cost, you haven't paid a lot. Rather than being a consumer of the thing with a plan to eventually throw it away, you're essentially holding an asset with the intent of selling it. If you can enjoy the asset while holding it, so much the better.
Small and lightweight is important because it keeps storage and transportation costs down.</p>
    
    <p> Reducing the need for storage allows for substantial cost savings, and keeping transportation costs down makes it easier to move. Think twice before getting anything that doesn't fit easily within a suitcase or which you can't carry.
Depreciation schedules The best way to think about cost is not the sticker price but the depreciation schedule. The depreciation schedule follows this equation:
Annual cost = (Your cost - Used price)/(Years in service).</p>
