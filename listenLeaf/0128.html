    <p> If you walk a lot or commute by foot, it works very well in cold/wet temperate climates. So if such a climate is in your future, start substituting into them the next time a garment or some footwear breaks down.
Running as transportation When I first came to the US in 2004, someone asked me if I rode bicycles. I replied in the affirmative, and then I was asked whether I liked to ride for fun.</p>
    
    <p> "For fun?" You see, in the US people mainly ride bikes recreationally, whereas in Europe people mainly ride bikes as a form of transportation. This partially goes to show how deeply ingrained the association of certain modes of transportation are with certain activities.
Further, in the US walking is something you do inside the mall, and in Europe walking is something you do to get to the bus stop. However, when it comes to running, both Europe and the US are similar in that running is a recreational activity.</p>
    
    <p> However, for the fit person who wouldn't break a sweat from jogging a couple of miles, running could easily be a way to get from A to B which is as simple as walking--you only need a pair of shoes-- but 2-3 times faster. For short distances up to three miles, it's almost as fast as slow cycling because it takes a few minutes on each end to get the bike out and ready. It's possible to run with small loads using a backpack. If the backpack is loaded with more than a dozen pounds, however, normal running becomes destructive to the knees.</p>
    
    <p> Instead, run in a gliding fashion,
keeping the knees close together and always one foot on the ground.
It would thus be possible to literally run small errands, like picking up small items from the supermarket, and anyone who does this on a regular basis is bound to end up with sustained low-intensity endurance and a resting pulse lower than 50 beats per minute.
If you managed to arrange your residence to be less than three miles from anything, you wouldn't even need a bicycle. In that case, I would walk to work, which would take 60 minutes that could be used for meditation,
brainstorming or calculating your passive income from your savings in as many ways as you can think of, and then run home, which would take about 20 minutes.</p>
    
    <p> When shopping, I'd run with an empty backpack and then walk a full backpack home. It is a more minimalist approach than the bicycle option.
Cycling Statistically, cycling is about as dangerous as driving a standard-sized car--SUVs are a little bit more dangerous because of rollovers and the increased difficulty of swerving out of the way in a bigger vehicle.97 However, many bike riders are killed because they ride in the wrong direction or on the sidewalk.</p>
    
    <p> A particularly lethal combination is riding the wrong way on the sidewalk; a turning car will never suspect you're coming.
Avoiding these bad habits, most likely learned while riding around on trikes in suburbia as a child, will make you safer riding a bike than driving a car.
On top of that, you must ride defensively; just presume that the other drivers are out to kill you because they don't know any better. A five foot tall teenager in her dad's supertruck literally might not know any better because she can't see you over the side window.</p>
    
    <p> Try to get eye contact with other drivers. They will mainly be looking for other cars; if you have not established eye contact, you can "safely" presume that they have not seen you and that they will go right out in front of you. Be courteous to other drivers, and in turn they will be courteous to you.
In terms of taking lanes, remember the following two rules:98 1) Ride with the cars (be in the correct turn lane).</p>
    
    <p> 2) The faster you go relative to the speed limit, the more of the lane you should take. If you go 15mph and the speed limit is 15mph, you should be close to the middle of the lane. If you go 15mph and the speed limit is 55mph, you should be close to the edge of the lane; once you go downhill and start pushing 40mph, you can start taking more lane. This automatically avoids you getting squeezed and it puts you in the right position during turns at light crossings.</p>
