    <p> Ease of sourcing is important. You don't want to own anything with proprietary parts! Fortunately, there are plenty of good websites and books--sometimes you have to ask for the shop manuals--which will tell you exactly which tools and which parts you need to accomplish a given task, down to the catalog number. Find these books by reading book reviews online.
I suggest starting with either simple repairs or simple construction projects and build a tool base as needs develop.</p>
    
    <p> It may behoove you to keep a list of receipts and expenses to deduct should you later decide to turn it into a business. Buying a set of, say, screwdrivers to "save" money is rarely worthwhile. You will end up breaking the ones you use constantly and with a collection of ones you never use. Never buy the set.</p>
    
    <p> Also avoid buying a fully equipped shop-set for the same reasons.
I recommend getting quality tools (see The fixer-upper or "holding") but doing cheap projects using cheap materials in the beginning. Quality has at least two components. First, tools are mostly an extension of the tool user.</p>
    
    <p> It wouldn't make sense to spend more money to get functions that the user can't fully utilize. Second, the inherent quality of the tool, as categorized into three tiers: basic/economic, standard, and shop/professional. These labels are typically not indicative of their place of use. Consider, for example, pedal wrenches, which are used to removed a pedal from the crank arm of a bicycle.</p>
    
    <p> A basic wrench is a short, stamped piece of hardened metal which is sold for "occasional" use. However, unless the pedal is new or the threads are covered with anti-seize, it will bind and the metal wrench will cut into your hand and most likely you won't be able to remove the pedal. It would be more accurate to say that the basic wrench is for light-duty use. Conversely, the shop wrench is longer, angled for leverage, easy on the hands, and accepts an extension bar (a piece of pipe used for leverage).</p>
    
    <p> The shop wrench will take off anything, even if you rarely use it. There is nothing more frustrating than an inadequate tool.
Unfortunately, it's hard to know in advance which strength of tool is required. Never buy the biggest tool just to be sure.</p>
    
    <p> Specifically, if you already have a light-duty tool which has proven sufficient so far, don't upgrade it for the sake of upgrading.
Making things is a synthetic/creative process which is based on first mastering the technical skills, second on mastering the design principles (see Gauging mastery). There are two paths to "enlightenment." On the first path one first learns all the technical skills before moving on to the design phase.</p>
    
    <p> This can be done by starting out in service and repair before moving on to rebuilds and, finally, builds. On the second path one starts out with a building project which usually comes with parts and a plan, and learns the skills on an as-needed basis. The former seems tailored to an educational/work/small business structure; the latter seems more tailored to the hobbyist. The money flow from the former could quickly turn positive.</p>
