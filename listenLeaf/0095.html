    <p> The Plastics.” Almost every adolescent maintains a mental flowchart like the one Janis put down on paper. Teens may not remember how to find the square root of a fraction or recall all the elements on the periodic table, but they can effortlessly explain and analyze the complicated social hierarchy that prevails at their high school. Starting with the launch of puberty, young people become powerfully driven to form bonds with, and establish a place among, their peers—an activity that entails an almost obsessive focus on the intricacies of relationships.</p>
    
    <p> They can’t help it: structural and hormonal changes taking place in the brains of teenagers persistently orient them toward the social sphere.
During adolescence, teens’ brains become more sensitive to social and emotional cues—responding more strongly to pictures of faces, for example,
than do the brains of children or adults. Teenagers’ brains also become more attuned to reward as puberty prompts an increase in the activity of neural circuits involving the feel-good chemical dopamine. And the sweetest reward for a teen is to be accepted and liked by her peers.</p>
    
    <p> In the service of navigating a newly complex and valued interpersonal ecosystem, the social brain appears to be “turned on” in teenagers nearly all the time. Says Matthew Lieberman of UCLA,
“What the brain really wants to do, particularly during adolescence, is explore and master the social world.” Yet at this very moment in their development, we tell teenagers to turn off their social brains when they arrive at school, and to focus instead on abstract information devoid of social meaning or context. Teachers, parents, and other adults treat social life as an unwelcome diversion from the real work at hand,
and in so doing, they set up a struggle for students’ attention and effort.</p>
