    <p> They can hunt and cook and they know the real nutritional value of various foods. They can clothe themselves. They know how to fix and even build a house. They know about sex and having children.</p>
    
    <p>
On the other hand, people in our "advanced" civilization know practically nothing about our world. Despite being wholly dependent on technology for all our needs, few understand how technology provides us with light, heat, food, communication, transportation, etc. All we know is how to turn on the ignition and press a button so technology magically performs its intended function. Despite their "education," students are still left to magical thinking and are thus unable to understand the direct causes in the world around them.</p>
    
    <p> Specific functions are thus associated with specific (brand name) products rather than the operating ingredients and construction of the product. It would never occur to them that the majority of their collection of 20 different and highly advertised cleaning products could all be replaced with the vinegar and baking soda which people used to use. It would never occur to them to chop garlic with a knife instead of using one of the many different designs of garlic press.
This product-oriented thinking extends to health.</p>
    
    <p> The connection between lifestyle and health has been lost. The focus has moved from a healthy lifestyle to affordable health insurance, making health a product rather than a state of being. Cardiovascular problems resulting from stress and lack of exercise can be solved by purchasing triple-bypass operations and popping specialized aspirins. People have heart attacks because they don't see the connection to their stressful, unhealthy lifestyles, and people die from heart attacks despite being surrounded by bystanders because practically none of them knows CPR or basic first aid.</p>
    
    <p> Critical thinking has been replaced by opinions derived from pundits and political and religious leaders since people prefer having other people think for them. World affairs are replaced with celebrity reporting, and satirical news is often more analytical than real news.
In conclusion, after "growing up," the only thing children know is that problems are solved by buying products; that in order to buy something,
one needs a job; and in order to get a job, one needs a college degree, which happens to be considered a brand name product as well.
College degrees A high school diploma used to be sufficient to obtain jobs in most vocations except a few professions which required advanced studies, like engineering, science, medicine, accounting, and law.</p>
    
    <p> This isn't the case anymore. Today, the only way to join the rank of salaried professionals is with a college degree, despite the fact that 85% of college graduates eventually find jobs in a field different from the one they graduated in. This is no surprise, as normal office job functions generally require little knowledge of underwater basket-weaving, 19th century Hungarian clog art,
or other things of academic interest. A college degree has thus come to serve as an admission ticket to the white-collar job market, as employers deemed that the selective process of getting through a college education is perfect for selecting the most mentally disciplined workers.</p>
    
    <p> Salaried, white- collar jobs are desirable because they're thought to provide superior and stable pay and fringe benefits. They're also perceived as less strenuous and less dangerous than manual labor. Today, there are notable exceptions to this perception. Lifestyle diseases associated with sedentary stress caused by pushing paper forms around with little autonomy and few tangible results diminish the health advantages compared to the small chance of having your arm ripped off in a centrifuge, say.</p>
    
    <p> In addition, a skilled machinist or driver can often make more than a mid-level office worker with equal years of tenure, and be able to find work anywhere. A self- employed electrician or plumber should be able to clear six figures and set his own hours. Yet young people seem unaware of this, and thus everybody,
even those with no aptitude or desire for intellectual challenges, try very hard to get into college no matter how it may impair their future earnings and financial independence.
While the service sector has slowly grown, and as employers have come to prefer college-educated job applicants, demand for college degrees has gone up.</p>
