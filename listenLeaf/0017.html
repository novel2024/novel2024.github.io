Second Stage: Dangling the Carrot of Salvation Step 5: The Olive Branch After the first three steps of brainwashing described above, a brainwashing victim is often feeling so terrible about themselves that they are looking to redeem themselves at whatever cost. The victim is often in a poor mental state and suffering from a low self-image. They have lost their former sense of identity and will clutch at any straws that are offered for the sake of feeling something again. It is likely that a target will undergo a nervous breakdown at this point, and this becomes the predator’s cue to swoop in and offer salvation.</p>
    
    <p>
After breaking down their target for a sustained period of time, the manipulator will often extend an olive branch so that the target can fall into the trap of believing that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. At this point, an olive branch might be anything from a kind word to a gift or maybe even some form of physical affection. This olive branch serves to show the target that there is some leniency to benefit from if they are on the manipulator’s good side. After all, the manipulator is a ‘good person’ who wants the best for them.</p>
    
    <p> At least that is what they have heard since the brainwashing began.
Step 6: Compulsion to confess Consider this: you have been subjected to intense psychological torture from an individual for a period of time. You have lost your sense of identity and are feeling confused and unworthy. You are nearing a nervous breakdown or have already undergone one and cannot make head or tails of any aspect of your life.</p>
    
    <p> You have been living in isolation after denouncing your social circle and cannot remember the last time you had a proper meal. Then this individual shows up at your doorstep one day carrying a steaming pot of coffee and freshly made muffins. They say they just want to talk. You let them into your home.</p>
    
    <p> You cannot believe it. This is the only kindness you have received in the longest time. What do you think will be your reaction to this unexpected kindness from your former abuser?
More often than not, you will feel a sense of indebtedness. Human beings like to reciprocate kindness for kindness.</p>
    
    <p> When someone does something nice for you, it is human to want to do something nice in return. For a brainwashed person, the need to pay back is even greater because they feel that they must also pay for everything that they are wrong about (at least as per the gospel of the brainwasher). As such, the brainwashed party will be more than eager to offer back some form of kindness. In their tortured minds, this kindness will often be in the form of a confession.</p>
    
    <p> Typically, the predator will offer the option of a confession as a way of getting paid back.
Step 7: Guilt channeling After weeks and months of being told that they are wrong about everything,
a brainwashed victim is often riddled with so much overwhelming guilt that they really have no room for any other emotion. The target has been bombarded with so much psychological torture from the predator that they are not even sure what they feel most guilty about. The victim just knows that they are guilty of something.</p>
    
    <p> In this confusion, the manipulator swoops in and convinces them that the guilt is because of all the wrong things that they have previously believed in. In other words, the predator channels the guilt to the belief system. The victim now starts to associate the guilt and the burden of dealing with the guilt with their belief system. The predator is, in essence, making their victim learn to associate all the bad feelings with their past, while at the same time making them believe that there is the chance of being redeemed and feeling better if they choose alternative beliefs.</p>
