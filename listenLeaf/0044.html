    <p> The outside world is not the friendliest place there is out there. There are bullies in school, pedophiles lurking in parks and playgrounds and child killers who have no qualms about ending young lives. When your child is done dealing with all the dangers presented by the modern world, they should always have a safe place to come to. This means that you must be careful about who you invite into your house at all times.</p>
    
    <p> Many times, the people who take advantage of children are people who are well known to them. As such, it helps to vet who make it into your child’s life and who doesn’t. Besides making the home physically safe by making it inaccessible to predators, you must also be your child’s safe place emotionally. Children who know that they can count on their parents have an easier time opening up about the challenges they are facing,
which will include that worrisome conversation they had with the creepy uncle during the last family get-together.</p>
    
    <p>
Be vigilant about what your child is watching and listening to When predators are unable to access children physically, they make use of other virtual channels to do their evil work. Parents of millennials and other older generations had an easier time as far as keeping the predators away.
Predators back then approached kids while they walked to school, at the playground, in shopping malls, and in other places that were easy to monitor.
Predators of today have gotten smarter and will enter your home even when you have locked all doors.</p>
    
    <p> Thanks to smartphones and the Internet, there is probably someone spying on your kid or trying to feed your kid information that they are better off without. If you must buy a smartphone for your teen,
make sure you give them a long, hard talk about the dangers that lurk on the inner web. Monitor the type of content that your kid is watching and make the use of parental controls that are offered by most video platforms. Do not allow your child to make friends with strange people on the Internet.</p>
    
    <p> Some of these strangers who contact children on the Internet have the worst of intentions, including being involved in child trafficking rings.
Do not sugarcoat truths When your child is young and incapable of understanding harsh truth, you’ll most likely do your best to sugarcoat the truth so that you do not give them weeks of endless nightmares. For example, you’ll not tell your kid that their goldfish died; instead, you’ll lie to them that little Mr. Bean went to live in another fish tank with his best fish friends.</p>
    
    <p> This is a normal part of parenting that involves wanting to shield your young one from the cruel realities of the world. As your child grows older; however, it is important to let them hear the truth from you before they start hearing half-truths from other people.
Kids are very impressionable and tend to believe what adults tell them. You must ensure that your child’s first point of contact is yourself.</p>
    
    <p> Do not let a predator creep into your child’s life under the guise of being their go-to person. If something bad happens in the community, explain this gently to your child and let them know that bad people who want to harm other people exist and they live among you, and there are certain signs that she should look out for.
Be the parent Yes, you want to make sure that your child likes you. Nobody wants to be hated by their kid.</p>
    
    <p> At the same time, you must acknowledge that winning a popularity contest is not your first priority as a parent. Your child is free to think of you as a party pooper as long as you are focused on keeping them safe. If something does not sit right with you, use your authority as a parent to question it until your gut instinct approves. Your sulking teenager will not be in their teens forever, and once they are older, they will be grateful that you looked out for them when they needed it most.</p>
