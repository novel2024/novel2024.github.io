The culture moves from growth to steady state when consumption equals production. At this point, all the niches have been fully filled and inter-company competition has reached a state of consolidation and "cease- fire." Now the salary men are motivated by fear of losing their job and a need to keep paying their bills rather than the desire to work for the best company. The focus is thus on following the rules set down by the businessmen to regulate the business.</p>
    
    <p> However, the spirit of those regulations are still directed towards the competitiveness of the company.
Eventually, some discover that they can maximize their personal benefit not by supporting the company, but by supporting themselves. In other words, they become decoupled from the business. They start thinking about their "number"--money in retirement accounts, broker accounts, net worth-- and they develop a fascination with tax deductions and gain impressive résumé-writing and interviewing skills.</p>
    
    <p> The entire system moves to finance,
services, and politics--all intangibles. Having forgotten the historical background of their cultural setup, people adopt firm "social-social" beliefs that any problem can be solved in the social sphere as long as someone is given enough money to make it happen. Any connection with nature and most connections with technology are lost. There's a belief that nature is irrelevant and that anything can be solved using the current methods--now technology; previously magic or praying.</p>
    
    <p> We have finally arrived at a stage where people will sell their soul to build their résumé, as long as they don't break the law; where people will work in polluting manufacturing plants while being against greenhouse emissions. This progression follows a clockwise cycle in this figure, which desribes the full development of a field; each type will be dominant at some point during this progression.
The next generation When a new field is invented, it's not the salary men, the businessmen,
or the working men who dominate it; it's the inventors--the Renaissance men. A new field does not need to be commercial, nor does it need to sweep the world or usher in a new era.</p>
    
    <p> Whether it's raising goats or a family,
starting an ecological community or an IT company, or preparing for the end of the world, the Renaissance man is the one who will get it done.
For several generations many people have been preoccupied with the mundane details of earning and buying as an end rather than a means. They spend their most productive hours and years in a job which they don't really care about, after which they go home exhausted to deal with spouse, kids,
dinner, bills, trying to keep up with the neighbors, and languishing in front of the TV because they have little energy left.
New generations have begun to question the wisdom of joining the scheme known as the rat race.</p>
    
    <p> Some have decided not to fight for a top spot in the corporate pyramid scheme, which in the previous stage was more akin to climbing the corporate ladder; instead, they bypass the gatekeepers of traditional career paths and search for new venues to populate so as to avoid the overcrowded traditional job market.
The big question is therefore whether to play the games of modern consumer society or whether to start something different and, dare I say more creative? We live in a consumer society where the focus is on service and finance, due to a declining natural resource base. We also see the emerging problems of consumer society--stress, overwork, inflation, lack of balance, lack of paradigm-shifting innovation, stagnation, and loss of control--both on a personal, and occasionally a national scale. This indicates that this figure is beginning to come to a full circle.</p>
    
    <p>
It's not clear which direction the next cycle will take humanity--brave new world, information revolution and the discovery of commercial fusion,
or peak oil/water, irreversible climate crisis, and the decline and fall of civilization.24 Yet this will all be decided by those who live now; in part by you, and none will be more ideally prepared for a changing world, indeed to change the world, than a Renaissance man.25 The Renaissance ideal A Renaissance man excels in a wide range of subjects. He is also known as a universal man, a polymath, or more derisively as a jack of all trades.</p>
    
    <p> In our modern, highly specialized world, the term jack of all trades typically implies master of none, but the traditional Renaissance man mastered one and often more subjects while being competent in many subjects.
There is some modern controversy as to what it means to be a polymath,
and thus by association what it means to be a Renaissance man. Several hundred years ago, when the terms first came into existence, the amount of human knowledge was still relatively minute and thus a dedicated person could eventually master many different fields of knowledge. However,
thanks to an immense number of researchers, the amount of available information today is equally immense.</p>
