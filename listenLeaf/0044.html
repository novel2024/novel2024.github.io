    <p> There’s also a place for what we might call designed gestures: that is, motions that are carefully formulated in advance to convey a particular notion. Geologist Michele Cooke’s gestures, inspired by sign language, fall into this category; she very deliberately uses hand movements to help students understand spatial concepts that are difficult to communicate in words.
Designed gestures offer another benefit as well: they are especially effective at reinforcing our memory. That’s because gesturing while speaking involves sinking multiple mental “hooks” into the material to be remembered—hooks that enable us to reel in that piece of information when it is needed later on.</p>
    
    <p> There is the auditory hook: we hear ourselves saying the words aloud. There is the visual hook: we see ourselves making the relevant gesture. And there is the “proprioceptive” hook; this comes from feeling our hands make the gesture.
(Proprioception is the sense that allows us to know where our body parts are positioned in space.</p>
    
    <p>) Surprisingly, this proprioceptive cue may be the most powerful of the three: research shows that making gestures enhances our ability to think even when our gesturing hands are hidden from our view.
Kerry Ann Dickson, an associate professor of anatomy and cell biology at Victoria University in Australia, makes use of all three of these hooks when she teaches. Instead of memorizing dry lists of body parts and systems, her students practice pretending to cry (the gesture that corresponds to the lacrimal gland/tear production), placing their hands behind their ears (cochlea/hearing), and swaying their bodies (vestibular system/balance). They feign the act of chewing (mandibular muscles/mastication), as well as spitting (salivary glands/saliva production).</p>
    
    <p> They act as if they were inserting a contact lens, as if they were picking their nose, and as if they were engaging in “tongue-kissing” (motions that represent the mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth, respectively).
Dickson reports that students’ test scores in anatomy are 42 percent higher when they are taught with gestures than when taught the terms on their own.
The acquisition of vocabulary is also central to learning a foreign language— and here, too, designed gestures can act as an aid to memory, says cognitive psychologist and linguist Manuela Macedonia. Today, Macedonia researches second-language acquisition as a senior scientist at Johannes Kepler University in Austria.</p>
    
    <p> But earlier in her career she was a language instructor, teaching Italian to German-speaking college students. Back then, Macedonia found herself increasingly frustrated with the conventional format of foreign-language courses: a lot of sitting, listening, and writing. That’s not how anyone learns their native language, she notes. Young children encounter new words in a rich sensorimotor context: as they hear the word “apple,” they see and touch the shiny red fruit; they may even bring it to their mouth, tasting its sweet flesh and smelling its crisp scent.</p>
    
    <p> All of these many hooks for memory are missing from the second-language classroom.
Macedonia sought to recover at least one: physical movement. She began pairing each vocabulary word with a corresponding gesture; after demonstrating the gesture for her students, she would ask them to perform the motion themselves while speaking the word aloud. Her students learned new words more easily this way, she found, and retained them more successfully over time.</p>
    
    <p>
Macedonia eventually became a student again herself, writing her PhD thesis on the use of gestures to enhance verbal memory during foreign-language encoding.
In the years since, she has continued to contribute to a growing body of evidence showing that enacting a gesture while learning a word helps cement that word in memory—perhaps by stimulating a more extensive network of areas in the brain.
In a study published in 2020, for example, Macedonia and a group of six coauthors compared study participants who had paired new foreign-language words with gestures to those who had paired the learning of new words with images of those words. The researchers found evidence that the motor cortex— the area of the brain that controls bodily movement—was activated in the gesturing group when they reencountered the vocabulary words they had learned; in the picture-viewing group, the motor cortex remained dormant.</p>
    
    <p> The “sensorimotor enrichment” generated by gesturing, Macedonia and her coauthors suggest, helps to make the associated word more memorable.
Macedonia has also begun experimenting with a form of extended technology that seems a natural fit with her previous work: an online language-learning platform that features a virtual agent, or “avatar,” providing instruction in vocabulary. The avatar on the screen behaves just as Macedonia did as a teacher:
it demonstrates a gesture, which the user imitates as he or she repeats the novel word. Evaluations of the platform show that users who follow the avatar in making a gesture achieve more lasting learning than those who simply hear the word.</p>
