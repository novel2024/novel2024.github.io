    <p> If bodyweight exercises are picked, the goals would be "less clutter," "health," and "healthy cooking." "Less clutter" already exists, so tag this triangle onto that point. The financial independence module has "frugality" and "savings" as goals. Tag this module onto the others by draw a half-circle.</p>
    
    <p> Add a "hobby" module, say healthy cooking and writing about it: "writing skills," "networking," and "cooking." This was just an example of a web--now make your own. It may be difficult to draw a sturdy web--however, take comfort if your goals are limited in quantity and you can find many activities (modules) that involve several of them. Like in object-oriented programming, naming the concepts can be the hardest part of this exercise.</p>
    
    <p>
Interconnected goal structure. Each square, triangle, or semi-circle represent a distinct modularized activity. If one goal fails, the tensegrity will pull and refocus the remaining goals with little shock to the entire system. Similarly, each link could be thought of as a skill, or alternatively, each triangle could be thought of as a skill set.</p>
    
    <p>
Tensegrity Having three goals (or more) for each module builds tensegrity into your plans and consequently your life. If one goal is pushed away, the other connected goals instantly pull your life in a slightly different direction.
These goals can be thought of as back-ups or secondary objectives, but it is better if all goals are approximately equally balanced in importance. For any given activity, one of the goals should not dominate the others.</p>
    
    <p> This approach is very different from the standard advice that encourages you to put all your eggs in the single basket of your job. Having a single goal makes a person effective, but it also makes him vulnerable and subject to discontinuous changes. Plans have to be altered radically or even rewritten completely if this goal fails.
Because of its flexibility and adaptability, it is important to realize that the web of goals strategy essentially is a process-oriented strategy rather that a goal-oriented strategy.</p>
    
    <p> On the meta level, a process-oriented strategy is primarily aimed at living, with goals being accomplished as side effects,
whereas a goal-oriented strategy is aimed at goals, with living as a side effect. It's natural that employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion,
as they can just break goals into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-term perspective be lost.
This is perhaps easier to explain using sports as an analogy.</p>
    
    <p> Most sports require several skills such as strength, endurance, agility, speed, toughness,
stamina, power, analytic aptitude, teamwork, etc.Â Here, training generally focuses on at least a few of those skills simultaneously for each training exercise, whereas the game ultimately requires all skills simultaneously.
Playing sports with multiple requirements has at least two benefits. First,
the more diversified one's sport is in terms of required skills, the easier it is to play any other sport.</p>
    
    <p> Second, if one skill is lacking, the other skills can still be built and they can, to a large extent, compensate for weakness in other areas.
Tactical principles Tactics are often presented as lists. These lists are both helpful and useless at the same time. They are helpful because they allow people to pick up a thing or two that they have not seen before, but they are useless because few people are capable of memorizing hundreds of little rules that might not even apply directly to their situation and remember to obey all of them.</p>
