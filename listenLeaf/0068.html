    <p> And just as in non-digital realms, these signals of non-belonging can negatively affect their levels of interest, and their expectations of success, in subjects like computer science, as well as influencing how actively they engage these topics.
René Kizilcec, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University, investigated the effect of adding a “gender-inclusive” image and statement to an advertisement for an online computer science course that ran on Facebook. The image featured a group of eight women of diverse ages and ethnicities; the statement read: “The history of computer programming is a history of WOMEN. You can join this epic journey.</p>
    
    <p>” Female viewers clicked through to find out more at a rate that was 26 percent higher than for a similar ad that did not include such cues. When gender-inclusive signals were embedded in the enrollment page for the course, women were 18 percent more likely to sign up.
In another study led by Kizilcec, the inclusion of a diversity statement on the Web pages of online courses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics increased the enrollment of students of lower socioeconomic status —another group that is often underrepresented in STEM fields. “This is an equal opportunity course that offers you a supportive and inclusive space to learn,” the statement read.</p>
    
    <p> “Everyone, no matter their age, gender, or nationality, can be successful in this course. People like you are joining from all over the world and we value this diversity.” Such “psychologically inclusive design,” as Kizilcec calls it, aims to lower barriers to participation by “strategically placing content and design cues in the environment”—an effort that is as important in the online world as it is in the material one.
 BRINGING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH to bear on our experience of the built environment is a relatively new phenomenon.</p>
    
    <p> For centuries, architects and builders have worked on the basis of tradition and intuition. Architect Louis Kahn, for example, consciously drew on the forms and styles of the past; he relied as well on his tactile sense of the material world, and on what the site or the structure demanded. In one of his characteristically gnomic remarks, Kahn described an imagined exchange between himself and the stuff of which his buildings were made. “You say to brick, ‘What do you want, brick?’ ” he began.</p>
    
    <p>
“Brick says to you, ‘I like an arch.’ If you say to brick, ‘Arches are expensive,
and I can use a concrete lintel over an opening. What do you think of that,
brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an arch.’ ” Jonas Salk observed of his architect that Kahn had “the vision of an artist, the understanding of a philosopher,” and “the knowledge of a metaphysician.</p>
    
    <p>” Sometime in the future, architects may need to add to that arsenal “the expertise of a neuroscientist.” The burgeoning discipline of neuroarchitecture has begun to explore the way our brains respond to the built settings we encounter—finding,
for example, that high-ceilinged places incline us toward more expansive,
abstract thoughts. That’s not hard to believe when one pictures the domed ceiling of the reading room at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, rounded like a bouquet of balloons, or the ethereal, cloud-studded ceiling of the Rose Main Reading Room at the New York Public Library in Manhattan. Symmetrical shapes, meanwhile, impress upon us a sense of power and robustness.</p>
    
    <p> Call to mind the Taj Mahal, built of white marble in the Indian city of Agra by the seventeenth-century Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It is perfectly symmetrical,
from the pair of minarets arrayed on either side, down to the tiles inlaid on the floor. (It’s noteworthy that the Salk Institute is also symmetrical, and indeed has been compared to the Taj Mahal.) As intensely social creatures, we respond positively to architectural designs that resemble faces—like the beloved Villa Rotonda, an Italian Renaissance villa designed by architect Andrea Palladio.</p>
    
    <p> Curved shapes, it has been found, induce in us a sense of ease and comfort; babies as young as one week old prefer to look at curved objects rather than sharp ones. The attraction goes so deep that it is found across generations, across cultures—even across species. Consider the undulating sculpture Sheep Piece, created in 1971–72 by the British artist Henry Moore. A study that scanned the brains of rhesus monkeys found that the areas of their brains associated with the experience of reward and pleasure lit up when they looked at it.</p>
