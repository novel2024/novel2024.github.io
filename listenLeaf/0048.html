The sights and sounds of nature help us rebound from stress; they can also help us out of a mental rut. “Rumination” is psychologists’ term for the way we may fruitlessly visit and revisit the same negative thoughts. On our own, we can find it difficult to pull ourselves out of this cycle—but exposure to nature can extend our ability to adopt more productive thought patterns. Gregory Bratman,
an assistant professor at the University of Washington, asked study participants to undergo a brain scan and to complete a measure of ruminative thinking before taking a ninety-minute walk outside.</p>
    
    <p> Half the participants strolled through a quiet, leafy natural area; the other half walked alongside a busy roadway. Upon returning to the lab, all the participants took the ruminative thinking measure and had their brains scanned for a second time.
People who’d spent the previous hour and a half in nature had become less preoccupied by the negative aspects of their lives; in addition, an area of the brain associated with rumination, the subgenual prefrontal cortex, was less active than before the nature walk. The people who had walked alongside a busy roadway gained no such relief.</p>
    
    <p> Rumination is especially common in those who are depressed, and research has shown that a walk in nature lifts the mood of people diagnosed with depression. It also improves their memory. The obsessive cycling through negative thoughts that many depressed people experience consumes a significant portion of their mental resources, adversely affecting their ability to recall important information—a deficit that time in nature helps ameliorate.
Yet another way that nature helps us think better is by enhancing our ability to maintain our focus on the task in front of us.</p>
    
    <p> People who have recently spent time amid outdoor greenery catch more errors on a proofreading assignment, for example, and provide quicker and more accurate answers on a fast-paced cognitive test, than do people who have just finished a walk in an urban setting.
Working memory—our ability to hold in mind information relevant to the problem we’re currently solving—also benefits from time spent in a natural setting. In a study led by Marc Berman, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, participants who walked through an arboretum for just under an hour scored 20 percent higher on a test of working memory compared to those who spent the same amount of time navigating busy city streets.
Time spent in nature can even relieve the symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
    
    <p> A pair of researchers at the University of Illinois, Andrea Faber Taylor and Ming Kuo, were intrigued by reports from parents that their ADHD-affected children seemed to function better after exposure to nature. Putting this possibility to an empirical test, they had children aged seven to twelve take a supervised walk in a park, in a residential neighborhood, or in a busy area of downtown Chicago. Following the walks, the youngsters who’d spent time in the park were better able to focus than the children in the other two groups—so much so, in fact, that on a test of their ability to concentrate, they scored like typical kids without ADHD. Indeed,
Taylor and Kuo point out, a twenty-minute walk in a park improved children’s concentration and impulse control as much as a dose of an ADHD drug like Ritalin.</p>
    
    <p> “ ‘Doses of nature’ might serve as a safe, inexpensive, widely accessible new tool in the tool kit for managing ADHD symptoms,” the researchers concluded.
All these salutary effects on our mental function can be understood as a process of restoration: time spent outdoors gives us back what the built environment so relentlessly drains away. More than a century ago, psychologist William James drew a distinction that bears closely on our understanding of nature’s restorative powers. There are two kinds of attention, wrote James in his 1890 book The Principles of Psychology: “voluntary” and “passive.</p>
    
    <p>” Voluntary attention takes effort; we must continually direct and redirect our focus as we encounter an onslaught of stimuli or concentrate hard on a task. Navigating an urban environment—with its hard surfaces, sudden movements, and loud, sharp noises—requires voluntary attention. Passive attention, by contrast, is effortless:
diffuse and unfocused, it floats from object to object, topic to topic. This is the kind of attention evoked by nature, with its murmuring sounds and fluid motions; psychologists working in the tradition of James call this state of mind “soft fascination.</p>
    
    <p>” The respite from insistent cognitive demands that nature provides gives our supply of mental resources an opportunity to renew and regenerate. As we’ve seen, these resources are finite and are soon exhausted—not only by the clamor of urban living, but also by the stringent requirements of academic and professional work. Just as our brains did not evolve to react with equanimity to speeding cars and wailing sirens, neither did they evolve to read, or to perform advanced math, or to carry out any of the highly abstract and complex tasks we ask of ourselves every day. Though we manage to meet these demands, our near- universal struggles with attention and focus (not to mention motivation and engagement) suggest that we ought to pay more heed to the supply side of our attentional economy—that is, not simply drawing down our mental resources but also ensuring their regular replenishment.</p>
