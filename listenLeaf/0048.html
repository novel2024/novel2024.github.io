    <p> Relying on outside analysis of those areas restricts the scope of choices, whereas your own critical analysis and synthesis create new choices. It makes you a leader rather than a follower. The average person is a follower.
Aside from being able to think, one should also know what to think about.</p>
    
    <p> If thinking is the tool, knowledge is the resource. It's only by combining these that productive solutions can be formed. There are few combinations more dangerous than an intelligent person without knowledge, experience, and wisdom. In general, the wider the scope of one's knowledge, the greater one's ability to think laterally and the more creative the solutions become.</p>
    
    <p> The Renaissance man should therefore acquire knowledge from many different fields so as to have the intellectual horsepower to solve many different kinds of problems. Also, he should acknowledge that breadth of knowledge is inherently valuable and that learning should not stop when leaving school.
Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to be able to prioritize the relevance of information and be able to quickly research and find relevant information in many different areas. Learn independently and have an interest in doing so.</p>
    
    <p>
have enough generalized knowledge to be able to understand the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or a procedure, and use it to ask further questions.
recognize which problems the model applies to, take the solution to one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem.
be able to critically analyze the model, refine it, and combine different models to achieve an objective. Practice critical thinking in all aspects of life to reach a degree of rational certainty.</p>
    
    <p> Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically.
synthesize interdisciplinary information and laterally connect similarities which are not immediately apparent, discovering new models and procedures.
evaluate different methods, models, and procedures while effectively ranking them for utility, and picking the best one while recognizing the pertinence of other methods. Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently and consistently.</p>
    
    <p> Master the fundamentals.
Economic Economic skills are necessary to rationally evaluate and distribute resources, both personal and financial. Without economic skills, it is impossible to put a price on value (value and price are not the same thing!) and this results in inefficient and less-than-optimal choices. For instance, is it better to a) spend time learning a more effective method which will save time in the future b) use the old, slow, but verified method or c) go to work and pay an expert to fix the problem?
Being aware of one's values (see Emotional), wants and needs, and being able to prioritize one's efforts to achieve specific goals is the most efficient and least expensive way to live a good life.</p>
    
    <p> Prioritizing well requires planning and seeing the bigger picture to plan a strategy for achieving one's goals. Here the big picture includes not only the world as it truly is, but also the world as it can become if specific choices are made,
including the results that will not obtain if the specific path is taken.
Economic analysis reveals such issues.
In addition, financial skills are important.</p>
    
    <p> In particular, they become increasingly important for anyone who accumulates more and more assets.
It's strange how specialists gladly spend a great deal of time perfecting their skills to pursue a five percent raise, while at the same time there is a fatalistic tendency to accept whatever investment strategies are currently fashionable on Wall Street when it comes to generating passive income.30 When investments become fashionable (a result of emergent behavior of a system), by definition they no longer offer good returns, even though they have historically when only used by a few people. Handing over responsibility for one's savings does not make sense, especially for anyone whose investment income is comparable to one's expenses or worse, one's job income.</p>
