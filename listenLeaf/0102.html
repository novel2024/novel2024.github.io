Christopher Myers witnessed this phenomenon firsthand in the course of conducting an unusual form of academic research. Myers, an assistant professor of management and organization at Johns Hopkins University’s Carey Business School, has logged many hours in the air, watching medical transport teams at work. These nurses and paramedics travel by helicopter to pick up patients from the scene of an accident, or from small community hospitals, ferrying them to larger facilities for advanced care. On the way, they administer treatment for a staggeringly wide range of illnesses and injuries.</p>
    
    <p> No single member of the medical transport team could possibly claim firsthand experience of every condition for which the team must provide care—forcing them to rely on the accumulated expertise of their teammates. And the way this expertise is shared,
Myers discovered, is largely through narrative.
During months of fly-alongs, he observed that much of the knowledge held by flight nurses was acquired not in formal training sessions, nor from guidebooks or manuals, but through informal storytelling in the downtime between missions.
“I don’t want to read about Toxic Shock Syndrome in a book,” one nurse said to Myers.</p>
    
    <p> “Tell me about the case you’ve just flown. What symptoms did he present? What did it look like? What did you do for him? We have protocols, but what if you guys added something that wasn’t in the protocol? Tell me why. Did it work?” Team members regularly related stories to one another about technical problems they had encountered with the helicopter’s equipment, about interpersonal issues they had confronted in taking over patient care from the staff at various hospitals—and, of course, about medical procedures they had performed or witnessed.
There was, for example, the tale of a patient who had fallen off a balcony at a wedding and impaled herself on the wedding singer’s microphone stand.</p>
    
    <p> The story of how the medical transport team successfully treated her injuries reoccurred to a flight nurse years later when her own team was called upon to help a bicyclist whose torso was impaled on one of his handlebars. “I had never actually seen something like that before,” the nurse told Myers about the bicycle injury. “But I’d heard the microphone-stand story, and so when we showed up on the scene it just kind of kicked in, like—‘Well, this is what they did with her,
so this is a good place to start.’ ” As Myers points out, such vicarious learning is increasingly necessary across any number of industries.</p>
    
    <p> The variety of unanticipated scenarios that may arise at a given moment is too great for any individual to have had direct experience with them all. Pressed by unfamiliar circumstances, workers may have no time to page through a procedural manual, or even to search for answers online; a trial-and-error approach is also too time-consuming, and too risky. But the professional who is in the habit of exchanging stories with co-workers has a deep well of vicarious experience on which to draw. The medical transport teams studied by Myers fly more than sixteen hundred missions a year; an individual nurse typically serves on a small fraction of these, perhaps two hundred.</p>
    
    <p> As one of them told Myers, listening to his colleagues’ stories gave him access to “fourteen hundred experiences a year that I don’t have personally.
The more you know about those other patients, the more you’re ready for the next one.” Narratives emerge organically in our communications with others; the role for leaders and managers lies in offering supports for, and removing barriers to, the storytelling in which their people would naturally engage. Two of the most important allowances that higher-ups can provide are time and space.</p>
    
    <p> In his research with transport nurses, Christopher Myers learned that stories weren’t usually shared during the crush of a work shift. A nurse he interviewed told him:
“There’s too much going on for there to be a ‘Hey, listen to this story’ or ‘This happened, and this . . .</p>
    
    <p>’ It seems to be a more informal [thing that happens when you’re] sitting around sharing war stories.” Some supervisors may look askance at such “sitting around,” but research shows it’s time well spent. One study found, for example, that a 1 percent reduction in efficiency, allowing time for “unstructured employee interaction,” produces a threefold increase in group performance over the long term. During such interaction, it may seem as though employees are simply exchanging gossip.</p>
