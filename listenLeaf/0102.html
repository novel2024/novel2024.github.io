    <p> If you can't share rooms with others and/or living in solitude is very important to you,
you need to reduce your expenses in other ways, by finding something smaller or relocating to another town.
Rent or own?
There is much money to be made in building and in transaction costs from buying and selling houses.70 There are significant pressures, political and economic, to get people involved in this game, including the strange idea of including the value of one's home in one's net worth or having taxpayers pay part of your interest while you pay the other part to the bank.71 This begets the crazy idea of a starter home and the even crazier idea of buying something bigger as income increases.</p>
    
    <p> This in turn has led to speculating in one's domicile, using arguments like, "Real estate always goes up; better buy before the market runs away." After the recent crash, I don't think I need to refute that anymore. If you're using a mortgage because houses always appreciate in value, you're simply speculating in leveraged real estate, something which is surprisingly unregulated compared to speculating in stocks on the margin, which uses the same principle. In the long run, real estate goes up at the same rate as inflation, which is to be expected for a practically risk-free, nonproductive asset.</p>
    
    <p> It's not a good idea to consider the house you live in as an "investment" unless you know more about real estate than the average person, and in particular, enough to speculate on its direction.
Including home value in one's net worth is an academic exercise, as this part of net worth is irrelevant to financial independence. What matters is cash flow (see Financial cash flow cycles) and it's well-known that any cash flow from your home is negative. The only question then is whether it's more negative than renting something similar.</p>
    
    <p> You can calculate whether this is the case by considering the net asset value (NAV) NAV = (annual rental income ×(1-upkeep))/(risk-free rate + risk premium).
Here the upkeep ratio is typically 30-40% of the rental income. The risk free rate is the going rate of 30-year bonds. The risk premium is typically 1- 2%.</p>
    
    <p> Calculate the capitalization rate (cap rate) given by cap rate = (annual rental income ×(1-upkeep))/(price).
The cap rate should be a few percent over the risk-free rate to adjust for the possibility of the house burning down. As you can see, it's essentially the same calculation. You should understand these calculations and be able to modify them to your situation.</p>
    
    <p>
In terms of rent, landlords attempt to pass on mortgage, maintenance,
and insurance costs to the renter. However, they can't charge more than what the rental market will bear. If you're renting and equivalent housing is selling at its NAV, the landlord is successfully passing all maintenance,
insurance, and mortgage costs on to you. In this case, you'll probably be better off owning since you should be able to maintain your home for less than what you're paying your landlord to pay for caretakers.</p>
    
    <p> If it's selling above NAV, you'll be better off renting. If it's selling below NAV, you'll be better off buying--unless you know you're going to move within the next few years.
How to find shelter The three most important things that matter for shelter are 1. Location relative to your work.</p>
    
    <p>
2. Location relative to your grocery outlet.
3. Cost.</p>
