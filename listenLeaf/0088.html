    <p> During a time when I had no access to libraries and was buying sufficient number of books to make my landlady inquire about the large number of deliveries I was receiving, I decided to go without books. I went from buying close to 100 books a year--about 30 times the average person--to buying three books in total over the course of a year-- about the same amount as the average person. That was not fun! However,
books aren't very expensive, so I decided that one book a month would be enough to satisfy my cravings, when combined with a newly developed interest in geopolitics which could be satisfied by reading news online.60 The lesson was that there was an optimal point which is slightly less than the extreme point.</p>
    
    <p> Most people will still consider the optimal point extreme,
but that's because they've never experienced the extreme. Try it out. Drink water exclusively for a month. Eat mostly or only rice and vegetables for a month.</p>
    
    <p> Stop smoking. Stop drinking. Stop eating and fast for a week. Don't spend any money for a week and try to improvise your solutions when needs arise.</p>
    
    <p> How long can you go without the consumer lifeline of the marketplace? Proceed intelligently and educate yourself from your responses.
The most helpful thought for avoiding new stuff is to realize that you have lived fine without it for this long, so why get it now? This will eliminate 99% of all electronic gadget lust.
How to get rid of things It's hard to determine where everybody got the bright idea to turn their houses into warehouses, but a very simple solution to this problem is to move all unused possessions into a storage unit, which is better suited for the purpose. This problem is relatively easy to solve, but is perhaps best attacked during a relocation.</p>
    
    <p> Go through all your possessions. For each possession, each book, each tool, each appliance, each toy, try to recall when you last used it and put it into one of the following categories. It's important to be honest. To avoid ruining the statistics, a box with 500 nails should be counted as one possession, whereas your stack of plates doesn't count as one stack of plates.</p>
    
    <p> You'll likely be using only one plate at a time with all other plates being for either guests or to supplement the stack of unwashed dishes in the sink. Be reasonable.
1. I used this today (keep it).</p>
    
    <p>
2. I used this within the past week (keep it).
3. I used this within the past month (keep it).</p>
    
    <p>
4. I used this within the past six months (get rid of it).
5. I used this within the past year (get rid of it).</p>
