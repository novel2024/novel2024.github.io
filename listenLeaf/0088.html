    <p> One by one he shows them the six drafts Austin produced on the way to his finished drawing, and tells them about the constructive critiques Austin received from his classmates at each stage.
The contents of Berger’s rolling suitcase are now available in an online archive—but he has found that many teachers and parents object to the use of models, afraid that it will suppress students’ creativity and originality. In fact the opposite is true, says Berger, who spent twenty-eight years as a classroom teacher before becoming chief academic officer of the nonprofit organization EL Education. Seeing examples of outstanding work motivates students by giving them a vision of the possible.</p>
    
    <p> How can we expect students to produce first-rate work, he asks, when they have no idea what first-rate work looks like?
The capacity of models to promote—rather than quash—students’ creativity was long recognized by teachers of composition and rhetoric, subjects that were once a central part of the curriculum in American schools. One of the field’s leading textbooks was authored by literature scholar Edward P. J. Corbett, who never relinquished the notion that emulating the work of the masters was the first step toward developing one’s own distinctive style.</p>
    
    <p> “Imitate, that you may be different!” Corbett thundered. Even as the use of models has faded from the teaching of English more generally, it is enjoying a resurgence among educators who are training students to write within particular academic genres, an activity sometimes called “disciplinary writing.” In this context, the emulation of model texts is valued for its capacity to reduce cognitive load—especially important when students are juggling new concepts and vocabulary while also trying to construct a coherent argument in writing. Following the contours of a prototype provided by the instructor permits students to process more deeply the material they are expected to learn.</p>

Marin Robinson, a chemistry professor at Northern Arizona University, leads an undergraduate course aimed at teaching students to “write like a chemist.” Those who enroll practice the writing of four forms central to the discipline: the journal article, the conference abstract, the poster presentation, and the research proposal. In each case, students follow the scientific and linguistic conventions on display in the “authentic texts” they are given: actual articles, abstracts,
posters, and proposals. This act of imitation relieves students of some of their mental burden, Robinson notes, allowing them to devote the bulk of their cognitive bandwidth to the content of the assignment.</p>
    
    <p> She and her collaborator,
English professor Fredricka Stoller, have authored a textbook, Write Like a Chemist, that is used at universities around the country.
A similar movement is emerging in teaching legal writing, another endeavor that requires students to assimilate a host of new terms and ideas even as they are learning to write in an unfamiliar genre. In the course of teaching hundreds of first-year law students, Monte Smith, a professor and dean at Ohio State University’s law school, grew increasingly puzzled by the seeming inability of his bright, hardworking students to absorb basic tenets of legal thinking and to apply them in writing. He came to believe that the manner of his instruction was demanding more from them than their mental bandwidth would allow.</p>
    
    <p> Students were being asked to employ a whole new vocabulary and a whole new suite of concepts, even as they were attempting to write in an unaccustomed style and an unaccustomed form. It was too much, and they had too few mental resources left over to actually learn.
His solution: at the start of the course, Smith provides students with several sample legal memorandums like those written by working lawyers. Guided by a set of instructions and targeted questions, students are expected to detail their responses to various aspects of the memos—thereby relieving them of the responses to various aspects of the memos—thereby relieving them of the burden of having to produce their own memos even as they are laboring to learn what a memo looks and sounds like.</p>
    
    <p> Only after several such structured encounters with legal documents are students asked to author their own memorandums.
As Smith notes, the emulation of model texts was once a standard feature of instruction in legal writing; it fell out of favor because of concern that the practice would fail to foster a capacity for independent thinking. The careful observation of how students actually learn, informed by research on the role of cognitive load, may be bringing models back into fashion.
 OF COURSE, the richest, deepest, and potentially most useful models are people.</p>

Yet the very individuals who are most expert are often least able to share what they know. After years of practice, much of experts’ knowledge and skill has become “automatized”—so well practiced that they no longer need to think about it. Automatization allows experts to work efficiently and effectively, but it also prevents them from offering to others a full account of how they do what they do. Kenneth Koedinger, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the director of its Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center, estimates that experts are able to articulate only about 30 percent of what they know.</p>
