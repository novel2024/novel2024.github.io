    <p> These champions have a superior ability to sense their bodies’ cues, and are therefore better able to monitor and manage their bodies’ resources as they rise to meet a challenge. They are like efficient, well-calibrated motors that don’t waste even a bit of power, keeping plenty of energy in reserve.
People with low resilience, by contrast, present a very different profile. When undergoing the inspiratory breathing load task, their brain scans show a pattern that is the opposite of Diana Nyad’s: low levels of activity before a stressor, and high levels during and after the stressor.</p>
    
    <p> The self-management of these individuals is sloppy, all over the place, like poorly calibrated motors that leak power. They are brought up short by challenges, and then waste energy in the scramble to catch up. They begin to struggle to answer the test questions.
Discouraged by their failures, their energy reserves depleted, they lose motivation and give up.</p>
    
    <p>
Such differences clearly matter in attempting a physical feat of courage or endurance, but they matter, too, when the pursuit is of a more cerebral sort.
Mental activity, like any other we undertake, requires the mobilization and management of energy; indeed, the brain consumes fully 20 percent of the body’s energy supply. The ability to allocate our internal resources effectively in tackling mental challenges is a capacity researchers call “cognitive resilience.” For one of Martin Paulus’s collaborators, cognitive resilience holds a special importance.</p>
    
    <p> Elizabeth Stanley, an associate professor of security studies at Georgetown University, is a member of a storied military family who spent years working as an intelligence officer in the US Army, including postings in Germany, South Korea, and the Balkans. In military service and in civilian life,
Stanley drove herself relentlessly; she describes her modus operandi as “dig in,
access deep wells of willpower and determination, and power through.” For decades, she writes, “I considered my capacity to ignore and override my body and my emotions in this way to be a good thing—a sign of strength, self- discipline, and determination.” Eventually, however, she came to recognize that “this default strategy was actually undermining my performance and well- being.</p>
    
    <p>” (The time she threw up all over her computer keyboard, after months of sixteen-hour days at work on her PhD dissertation, was one hint.) Seeking a different approach, Stanley found her way to mindfulness meditation, which she practices daily; she also created a program, called Mindfulness-based Mind Fitness Training, designed to bolster the cognitive resilience of service members facing high-stress situations. MMFT, as it is known, places an emphasis on recognizing and regulating the body’s internal signals. In collaboration with academic psychologists and neuroscientists,
Stanley has tested the efficacy of the program among troops as they prepare to deploy to combat; results show that the training helps participants maintain their attentional focus and preserve their working memory even under the most challenging circumstances.</p>
    
    <p> In workshops around the country, Stanley teaches the method not only to members of the military but also to others in high-stress occupations: firefighters, police officers, social workers, health care providers,
disaster relief workers.
Like the expert traders interviewed by Mark Fenton-O’Creevy, and like the elite athletes studied by Martin Paulus, Stanley has found that the most cognitively resilient soldiers pay close attention to their bodily sensations at the early stage of a challenge, when signs of stress are just beginning to accumulate.
She instructs her workshop participants to do the same, using mindfulness techniques similar to the ones described by Jon Kabat-Zinn. By remaining alert to these preliminary signals, she says, we can avoid being taken by surprise and then overreacting, entering a state of physiological arousal from which it is hard to come down.</p>
    
    <p> (Stanley notes ruefully that many of us take just the opposite approach, as she once did: pushing aside internal red flags in the hope that we can “power through” and get the job done.) Stanley also demonstrates for her students a technique she calls “shuttling”— moving one’s focus back and forth between what is transpiring internally and what is going on outside the body. Such shifts are useful in ensuring that we are neither too caught up in external events nor too overwhelmed by our internal feelings, but instead occupy a place of balance that incorporates input from both realms. This alternation of attention can be practiced at relaxed moments until it becomes second nature: a continuously repeated act of checking in that provides a periodic infusion of interoceptive information.</p>
    
    <p> The point is to keep in close contact with our internal reality at all times—to train ourselves “to pay attention and notice what’s happening while it’s happening,” as Stanley puts it. The vision of resilience she offers is not a formidable display of will and grit of the kind she once would have embraced; it is, rather, a flexible, moment-by-moment responsiveness to changing conditions—both inside and out.
 AN AWARENESS OF our interoceptive signals can assist us in making sounder decisions and in rebounding more readily from stressful situations. It can also allow us to enjoy a richer and more satisfying emotional life.</p>
