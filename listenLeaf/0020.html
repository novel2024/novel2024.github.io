    <p> Measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, this cycle is highly productive, but it could be argued that the net effect is not very productive at all. Thanks to advertising, nobody knows when enough is enough, even though running out of space in the garage should serve as an indication. Material wants are universally believed to be infinite in scope.
On top of that, everyone seems to want a cut of your earnings.</p>
    
    <p> The harder you work, the greater the cut. The tax authorities want their cut, and the more you work, the more they want. People want money to manage the money you don't spend, and money to take care of the things that you don't have time to take care of yourself. This requires more work and, hence,
even more costs in terms of day care, business clothes wear and tear,
expensive haircuts, power lunches, and snack bars.</p>
    
    <p> People run harder and harder but somehow don't seem to get ahead, continuously bleeding money as luxuries become wants, wants becomes habits, and habits become needs,
and so they slowly die a financial death by a thousand nibbling ducks.
Living to work and spend, it's not surprising that people derive their main identity through their job title and their purchases: "What do you do for a living and which brand names do you buy to express your lifestyle?" Despite a doubling of productivity over the past two generations, our culture is still perpetuating the old ritual of eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep and eight hours of spare time, even though this should have been reduced to four hours of work, eight hours of sleep and 12 hours of spare time by now. Maybe people are just doing what they have been told to do by parents, friends, politicians, and others. There is massive stigma associated with occupying one's time with things other than working and buying advertised goods.</p>
    
    <p>11 A tremendous amount of effort goes into career advancement, to earn more money and buy more stuff. Countless books are written and many workshops are given on how to stay late to appear dedicated, how to leave early to appear efficient, where to sit and how to sit,
how often and loud to speak at meetings to be noticed by the boss, how to handle performance reviews, and how to worry about other things that are essentially beyond your control anyway and thus cause a lot of stress.
Similarly, experts explain which questions are asked in a job interview,
which responses to give for the best impression, and how to word a résumé so that it'll stand out amongst the hundreds of other résumés that follow exactly the same advice. While such advice appears to be helpful, it only serves to increase the competitive pressure.</p>
    
    <p> It's just like Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons. In turn, employers make a big deal out of finding employees with the right fit, people who either learn or are naturally talented at playing the games of the system. The nascent consumer should already have had practice at fitting in and being popular from high school. In fact, high school athletics is a good preparation for today's corporate world due to importance of "team play.</p>
    
    <p>" Similarly "having no life" (nothing wrong with that, but you know what I mean) is a good preparation for life in academia.
The Darwinian "survival of the fittest" often has undertones of "survival of the best," a belief that the "fittest" are happy to reinforce. The distinction should not be forgotten, though. In competitive environments, the selection isn't for the best but for those that best fit the environment.</p>
    
    <p> People are not selected for the best attributes, they're selected for the fittest attributes. A world without trees selects the short-necked giraffe, which is better adapted.
Similarly, the career track selects people who are willing to give up their lives for the sake of work.
Most promotions are governed12 by the requirement for seniority.</p>
    
    <p> This means that a superior has to be promoted, retired, or fired before an inferior can be promoted. Naturally, this predictable trajectory of promotions is subject to demographics. Hence, if you want a good estimate of your career prospects, have a look at the birth rate as a function of time. Also, during periods of economic growth and rapid expansion, promotion is much easier than during periods of contraction or stagnation.</p>
