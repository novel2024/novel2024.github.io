    <p> The elderly and the very young for instance are ripe candidates for brainwashing thanks to the naivete brought on by inexperience and being out of touch with modern brainwashing scams.
Watch out for spun tales A person can dress up truth to the extent where it becomes a blatant lie. The media is particularly guilty of this. There is a wise person that said that news is when a man bites a dog and not when a dog bites a man.</p>
    
    <p> In a bid to show that the man bit the dog, news outlets are always looking to sensationalize what they report. A media company might carry out a quick poll of ten men living in Indiana and then report it as a survey of American men in the Midwest. Hardly a representative sample, but it packs a greater punch this way. Always be aware of the element of exaggeration and whenever possible, ask for sources to be cited for every claim that you come across in the media.</p>

Don’t believe the hype Have you ever noticed that the things that receive the most hype are often overrated? Many marketing gurus have mastered the art of passing off their products and services as the best in the market when, in fact, they are not.
Before you believe all the hype created about a person or product take a moment to consider why the said entity requires so much advertisement if they are as good as they claim to be. A thing of value does not require announcing because people will naturally flock to it.
Today’s world is particularly invested in the hype, especially since it has become so much easier to disseminate information, false and otherwise.</p>
    
    <p> A person just needs to write an article or create a video that will ‘go viral.’ Before you know it, there is an individual at the other end of the world that believes that a certain individual or product is the solution to all their problems.
Be wary of groupthink In the simplest terms, groupthink is the uncanny ability of otherwise intelligent people to make stupid decisions just for the sake of consensus.
Groupthink is a trapdoor for the people who do not like standing out in crowds or being the dissenting voice.</p>
    
    <p> Brainwashers are particularly happy about the existence of groupthink because more often than not, they do not like their targets to question them. Groupthink is the reason why hundreds of followers of a questionable religious figure will make decisions that do not seem normal to everyone else. Whenever you find yourself in a room with others where a decision needs to be made, do not be afraid to be the voice of reason that the room so desperately needs. You just might save yourself and a couple of others from being brainwashed.</p>

Choose timelessness over trends What phone do you have? What happened to the last phone that you had--did it outlive its usefulness, or did you buy because you felt you had to upgrade?
Do you buy things when you need them or because you feel pressured to have them? Depending on how you have answered these questions, you might start to see a habit in your choices: you are either the practical type that buys for functionality or the trend junkie that has to get every new version of the iPhone whenever it is unveiled. There’s nothing wrong with owning the sleekest new model of anything, but you have a big problem on your hands if you have been brainwashed into believing that you must have the newest of everything.
You can protect yourself from further descent down the slope by always choosing timelessness over trends. More often than not, most upgrades are not even upgrades.</p>
    
    <p> A manufacturer might claim that something is new and improved when in fact they only just changed the packaging. Such a manufacturer is only preying on your desire for shiny new objects. You cannot blame the manufacturer--that’s how they stay in business. You can only make sure that you do not fall for their tricks.</p>
    
    <p>
Pay attention to your gut feeling Whether you prefer to call it intuition or a hunch, your gut feeling is something that you should acknowledge as you go about your daily life.
Many people have saved themselves a whole lot of trouble and pain by listening to that nagging inner voice that so many love to ignore. Your unconscious mind can quickly pick up danger before your conscious mind does. If someone is selling you an idea that does not feel right, listen to your gut feeling.</p>
