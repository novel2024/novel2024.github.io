    <p> It's perfectly possible to save up enough money to buy a small home and buy it in cash, 100% down.
To determine whether it is worthwhile, just compare your portfolio's return on investment to the cap rate of the real estate you're buying. The only case where credit scores may be important is in obtaining insurance or a job. If this concerns you, get a single card and pay the balance off in full every month.</p>
    
    <p> That is what I do. It doesn't result in the top scores like those who have enough credit to go $50,000 in debt overnight, based on a decade of regular payments on massive balances. On the other hand, it is not subprime either.
Insurance The way insurance works is that a company takes premiums from a pool of people and pays it out to those who have accidents and make claims.</p>
    
    <p>
Actuaries are generally very good as estimating how accident-prone groups of people are, and the difference between take-in and pay-out is generally low (this is also known as the combined ratio). Insurance companies thus make their money by holding your money, called the float, and investing it for their own profit.
Since the insurance company is willing to take the bet in return for the proceeds from investing the float, it means that you should not take the bet unless your financial loss would be catastrophic--or you know better than the actuaries. Furthermore, you also have the opportunity to proactively reduce the risks.</p>
    
    <p> If you think about the potential consequences of everything you do--that is, careful--you can substantially reduce your risk.
On the other hand, if you know your behavior is risky, paying for insurance might be worthwhile, unless the insurance company also knows this, in which case they will simply charge you more.
Many insurance plans are better thought of as financing than insurance.
This holds for insurance plans that pay for regular maintenance such as health and dental.</p>
    
    <p> Here the cost of the maintenance gets added to the premium along with a profit for the insurance company, similar to how a credit company collects interest. They would not offer these fully loaded plans unless it was unprofitable for you.
Preventing catastrophic, that is, irrecoverable losses is the only reason to carry insurance. Effectively, this means carrying as high a deductible as possible while at the same time having enough funds, which you can invest,
to cover losses up to that deductible.</p>
    
    <p> Oftentimes, people carry too much insurance simply because they don't have the money on hand to cover the deductible. This shouldn't be a problem for you though, and so you'll profit.
Another common argument is that the monthly premium is low. This is like saying that a stock is cheap because it trades for $3.</p>
    
    <p> This argument is common for renter's insurance. However, this is a case where it should be easy to have the funds to replace anything that was lost which can be bought. Especially when considering the methods in How to get things.
Furthermore, it saves the hassle of battling the insurance companies, which have a habit of routinely denying the first claim.</p>
    
    <p>
Some insurances are not necessary. Once you're financially independent, you don't need unemployment insurance. You don't need life insurance, as your estate's assets can simply support another dependent. You don't need disability insurance since you don't need to work to live.</p>
