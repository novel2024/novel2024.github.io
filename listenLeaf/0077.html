    <p> And indeed, researchers who have observed artists,
architects, and designers as they create report that they often “discover” elements in their own work that they did not “put there,” at least not intentionally.
Gabriela Goldschmidt, professor emeritus of architecture at the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, explains how this works: “One reads off the sketch more information than was invested in its making. This becomes possible because when we put down on paper dots, lines, and other marks, new combinations and relationships among these elements are created that we could not have anticipated or planned for. We discover them in the sketch as it is being made.</p>
    
    <p>” Architects, artists, and designers often speak of a “conversation” carried on between eye and hand; Goldschmidt makes the two-way nature of this conversation clear when she refers to “the backtalk of self-generated sketches.” Research by Goldschmidt and others shows that those who are skilled at drawing excel in managing this lively dialogue. Such studies find, for example,
that expert architects are far more adept at identifying promising possibilities within their existing sketches than are relative novices. In one in-depth analysis of an experienced architect’s methods, researchers determined that fully 80 percent of his new ideas came from reinterpreting his old drawings.</p>
    
    <p> Expert architects are also less likely than beginners to get stuck perseverating on a single unproductive concept; they are proficient at recombining disparate elements found in their sketches into new and auspicious forms.
From these observations of expert draftsmen, some promising prescriptions can be drawn. When setting out to generate new ideas, we should begin with only the most general plan or goal; early on in the process, vagueness and ambiguity are more generative than explicitness or definition. Think of the task not in linear terms—tracing a direct line from point A to point B—but rather as a cycle: think, draw, look, rethink, redraw.</p>
    
    <p> Likewise, don’t envision the mind telling the pencil what to do; instead, allow a conversation to develop between eye and hand, the action of one informing the other. Finally, we ought to postpone judgment as long as possible, such that this give-and-take between perception and action can proceed without becoming inhibited by preconceived notions or by critical self-doubt.
Across the board, in every field, experts are distinguished by their skillful use of externalization; as cognitive scientist David Kirsh has written of video game virtuosos, “Better players use the world better.” Skilled artists, scientists,
designers, and architects don’t limit themselves to the two-dimensional space of the page.</p>
    
    <p> They regularly reach for three-dimensional models, which offer additional advantages: users can manipulate the various elements of the model,
view the model from multiple perspectives, and orient their own bodies to the model, bringing the full complement of their “embodied resources” to bear on thinking about the task and the challenges it presents.
David Kirsh has made close observations of the way architects use physical mock-ups of the buildings they are designing; when they interact with the models they have constructed, he maintains, “they are literally thinking with these objects.” Interactions carried out in three dimensions, he says, “enable forms of thought that would be hard if not impossible to reach otherwise.” Kirsh calls this the “cognitive extra” that comes from moving concrete objects through physical space—a mental dividend that made the difference for one scientist struggling with a seemingly insoluble problem.</p>

 A DREARY DAY in February 1953 found James Watson in low spirits. He and his collaborator Francis Crick—both young scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England—had been working for months to determine the structure of DNA, the molecule that contains the genetic code for living things.
That morning a colleague had urged him “not to waste any more time with my harebrained scheme,” as Watson later recounted in his autobiography. Hoping to demonstrate that his proposed arrangement of the four chemical bases that make up DNA—adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine—was true to life, he had asked the machinists at the Cavendish workshop to solder models of the bases out of tin.</p>
    
    <p> The models were taking too long to be finished, however, and Watson felt as if he had “run into a stone wall.” Finally, “in desperation,” he took on the job himself, and spent the afternoon fashioning models out of stiff cardboard.
Watson continues the story: “When I got to our still empty office the following morning, I quickly cleared away the papers from my desktop so that I would have a large, flat surface on which to form pairs of bases held together by hydrogen bonds.” At first he tried fitting his cardboard bases together in a fashion dictated by his latest thinking about how the elements of DNA might be arranged—but, Watson related, “I saw all too well that they led nowhere.</p>
    
    <p>” So he “began shifting the bases in and out of various other pairing possibilities.” Then realization dawned: “Suddenly I became aware that an adenine-thymine pair held together by two hydrogen bonds was identical in shape to a guanine- cytosine pair held together by at least two hydrogen bonds.” Moving around the pieces of his cardboard model, Watson began to envision the chemical bases embedded in a double helix structure. “All the hydrogen bonds seemed to form naturally,” he noted; “no fudging was required to make the two types of base pairs identical in shape.</p>
