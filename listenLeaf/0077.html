    <p> Yet, the more you know, the more you realize that often even experts are simply bodging. You may find this comforting or worrying depending on your personality and how much you know. One problem with bodging is that it's difficult to tell whether someone is winging it or actually knows what they are doing. A good way to tell an expert bodger from a pseudo-expert is to see if the bodger understands why he is doing something a particular way.</p>
    
    <p> If he mentions "beliefs," "authority," "others," etc., chances are good that he is winging it for personal gain. Be honest about yourself. If you can't bodge, delay the project and work on something easier until you can.</p>
    
    <p>
Bodging transitions smoothly into fixing things. Fixing things, or rather parts, eventually transitions into creating parts. First you'll be creating replacement parts, but eventually you'll be creating your own parts. At this point you'll thoroughly understand the technology you're using and be ready to make your own custom-made tools to solve problems.</p>

This way of learning differentiates itself from the educational system because it is real learning--that is, learning by doing rather than learning by taking notes, passing tests, and getting degrees. When I, having gone through the latter process, talked to people about how they learned to fix engines, I was surprised to learn that very often they had never taken a course. The typical story was that at some point they had gotten a broken engine and simply tinkered with it until it worked.
Each new method requires further development of skill, and you may find yourself transitioning through different stages depending on your other skills and personality.</p>
    
    <p> At any point in time, one stage may dominate your thinking since few will be able to develop all skills equally fast. Those with strength of character will seek to change, simplify, and downsize, as it goes well with "doing without things." Once a resilient network has been established, bartering, swapping, and wheeling and dealing will become more exciting than simplifying. Technical skills ultimately lead to creative pursuits, building and making things and rarely doing without, despite rarely buying anything.</p>
    
    <p> In my case, I quickly found myself cooking my own meals and giving things away and acquiring others for free, whereas it took me a long time to start a garden and I'm still learning to fix motors and build furniture. Other journeys may be different.
Appropriate response Materialism has a fascination with overbuilding, oversizing, and overcompensating. This is bad economics.</p>
    
    <p> Consider that for each thing that gets overbuilt, there's something that doesn't get built. For each thing that gets underbuilt, there's something that must be replaced when it breaks.
Both problems mean that resources are wasted.
Resources are wasted when the response is not appropriate for the situation.</p>
    
    <p> Responses can be divided into labor, capital, and management.
Many are short on skill (management) and time (labor), therefore money (capital) is spent to compensate, hence the existence of automatic egg boiler gadgets and other atrocities. What is ignored here is that the opportunity cost in terms of time spent working (or watching TV) and time not spent learning a skill (such as how to boil an egg) is often higher than the cost in time to learn to boil an egg in a pot and actually do it. Indeed, the time savings of gadgets is often overestimated, while the time needed to learn a skill is equally often overestimated.</p>
