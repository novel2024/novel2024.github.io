    <p> His explanation: when our minds are otherwise occupied, we resort to mental shortcuts—convenient stereotypes,
familiar assumptions, well-worn grooves. These are the thoughts that come most readily to mind, that take the least mental energy to generate. It requires abundant cognitive resources to inhibit these stale, reflexive responses and to reach beyond them for ideas that are fresher and more original.
Privacy supports creativity in another way: it offers us the freedom to experiment unobserved.</p>
    
    <p> When our work is a performance put on for the benefit of others, we’re less likely to try new approaches that might fail or look messy.
Ethan Bernstein, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, has investigated the relationship between privacy and innovation at a mobile phone factory in China. In a study published in 2012, he found that granting the workers greater privacy—concealing their activities behind a curtain—led them to become more innovative and more productive. They came up with faster and more effective ways of doing their work when the process of experimentation was shielded from view.</p>
    
    <p>
A similar dynamic prevails in white-collar work, says Bernstein, where the surveillance that employees experience may be digital in nature. Professionals are less likely to play around with new ideas or approaches when they know that an all-seeing electronic eye is tracking their every keystroke. It’s not simply that staffers fear their bosses will think they’re goofing off or breaking the rules.
Being subject to oversight at all times is a disempowering experience, and feeling powerless discourages exploration and creativity.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, a number of studies have found that a sense of privacy leads to feelings of empowerment,
which in turn lead to greater creativity.
Lastly, the benefits of privacy extend to our communications with colleagues.
Effective collaboration often requires a degree of discretion—a retreat from public scrutiny that’s hard to find in an open office. Research has found that employees have fewer and more superficial work-related conversations in wall- less spaces, often because they are leery of discussing delicate or confidential matters in the open.</p>
    
    <p> Ben Waber, whose firm, Humanyze, tracks employees’ activities via wearable sensors, found that after companies move from a workplace with enclosed offices to an open-plan workspace, interactions among employees actually decrease during most times of the day. “This may be due to employees putting on headphones or the difficulty of engaging in conversation when dozens of people are within earshot,” Waber notes. Other studies have found that as workspaces become more open, trust and cooperativeness among co-workers declines. The open-plan office seems to discourage exactly the kind of behavior it was intended to promote.</p>
    
    <p>
Such negative effects are especially pronounced in offices where employees have no assigned workspace at all, an increasingly common arrangement. The drawbacks of “hot-desking” or “hoteling,” as it’s called, point to another way in which space can be used to extend our minds (but too often is not). When we operate within a space over which we feel ownership—a space that feels like it’s ours—a host of psychological and even physiological changes ensues. These effects were first observed in studies of a phenomenon known as the “home advantage”: the consistent finding that athletes tend to win more and bigger victories when they are playing in their own fields, courts, and stadiums.</p>
    
    <p> On their home turf, teams play more aggressively, and their members (both male and female) exhibit higher levels of testosterone, a hormone associated with the expression of social dominance.
But the home advantage is not limited to sports. Researchers have identified a more general effect as well: when people occupy spaces that they consider their own, they experience themselves as more confident and capable. They are more efficient and productive.</p>
    
    <p> They are more focused and less distractible. And they advance their own interests more forcefully and effectively. A study by psychologists Graham Brown and Markus Baer, for example, found that people who engage in negotiation within the bounds of their own space claim between 60 and 160 percent more value than the “visiting” party.
Benjamin Meagher, an assistant professor of psychology at Kenyon College in Ohio, has advanced an intriguing theory that may explain these outcomes.</p>
