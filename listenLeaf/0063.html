    <p> In a world of abundance, delayed gratification is the optimal strategy. Genetically, there's a preference for the former, which means that a mature person with a measure of self-control has an advantage, being able to wait for bargains. It also means if you have patience and don't depend on speed, there are fewer costs to be paid for the additional power that speed otherwise requires. It's helpful to master the art of waiting.</p>
    
    <p> We are prone to action, but often the problems we perceive as urgent turn out to be less than urgent. Sometimes they will even resolve themselves without any interaction.
Using the modules correctly The problem with most non-Renaissance goal setting is that it is either linear--that is, typically advancing along a predetermined career path--or it is separated from life--that is, a businessman may have many goals for the business but few goals for himself. Similarly, salary men and working men are likely to concentrate on only a single goal, such as maintaining a certain grade point average, getting a raise, accumulating a certain amount of money, getting promoted, providing for a family, etc.</p>
    
    <p> If there are multiple goals, they're likely to be separated by the work-life mantra (see this figure). Here one goal could be to provide for the family, and the other,
unrelated goal could be to reach a more ideal bodyweight. For the Renaissance man, however, the end goal is to blur the line between work and life rather than a balance between work and life. Consider that almost any work becomes drudgery if you have to do it all day every day, whereas scrubbing toilets or filing forms might not be too bad if you only have to do it 15 minutes a week.</p>
    
    <p>
Ultimately all modules should produce value in some form: better health, new/better connections or skills. And no module should consume the value produced by another. In particular, different productions should never cancel each other out, something which is all too common these days.
For example, the invention of faster transport was canceled out by increasing travel distances, larger productivity was canceled out by greater waste, etc.</p>
    
    <p>
With each module being self-supported, self-sufficient, internally integrated, and loosely coupled, with no module dominating the others,
modules should be easily substitutable, but connected in a loose confederation of "independent entities" aligned in a common goal, so that the sum is greater than the parts. In other words, arrange your life like an orchestra or a sports team, which don't depend on any single player.
Contingency goal-setting When pursuing a goal with an externally preset strategy, there's a strong tendency to focus on tactics to increase productivity. Crank the machine faster to get done sooner.</p>
    
    <p> "Here's how you can save five minutes while brushing your teeth, and here's how you can more effectively respond to e- mails, and here are 500 additional tips." The reason is that, other than working faster, most people really don't have a lot of freedom in terms of strategies for reaching their goal, since their strategies are locked in (see The lock-in) either externally by association--for example, company procedures--or internally, by habit or tradition. The only way is therefore to use slightly more effective tactics. Consider, for example, a factory floor,
where the only allowed means of increasing productivity is to run each station faster.</p>
    
    <p> Now, admittedly, if you have a million employees, you can probably save a million minutes by getting your workers to spend one minute less on a given task, and if you're the business owner, it all adds up,
maybe to $1 million for you and one million curses from the employees.
Perhaps a redesign of the factory floor layout, that is a new production strategy, would be more effective than reusing the old strategy with slightly better tactics? For the individual person, who is saving a minute here and a minute there to spend working towards his goal, another goal-seeking strategy would be more effective.
Thus, to increase effectiveness, the focus must be on improving on the strategy rather than improving on the tactics. Rather than using better tactics to reach goals, the goal-setting method must become better.</p>
    
    <p>
Traditional goal-setting is one-dimensional. It follows a process that essentially draws a line between A and B and then divides that line into small steps of actions that are taken in an incremental fashion. The problem with this approach is not so much the division into steps, which can be psychologically helpful or a way of maintaining managerial control or measuring progress. Rather, it's in the goal-setting itself, in particular the drawing of a straight line between A and B.</p>
