Finally, in chapter 9, we’ll examine how groups thinking together can become more than the sum of their members.
Across these varied instantiations of the extended mind, several common themes are apparent. The first of these concerns the source of Andy Clark’s initial inspiration: the role of technology in extending our thinking. Our devices can and do extend our minds, of course—but not always; sometimes they lead us to think less intelligently, as anyone who’s been distracted by clickbait or misled by a GPS system can tell you.</p>
    
    <p> The failure of our technology to consistently enhance our intelligence has to do with a metaphor we encountered earlier in this introduction: the computer as brain. Too often, those who design today’s computers and smartphones have forgotten that users inhabit biological bodies,
occupy physical spaces, and interact with other human beings. Technology itself is brainbound—but by the same token, technology itself could be extended,
broadened to include the extra-neural resources that do so much to enrich the thinking we do in the offline world. In each of the chapters that follow, we’ll encounter examples of such “extended technology”—from an online foreign- language-learning platform that encourages its users to make gestures and not just repeat words; to a Waze-like app that plots not the fastest route but the one most filled with nature’s greenery; to a video game that induces players to look not at the screen but at one another, synchronizing their movements in pursuit of a shared experience.</p>
    
    <p>
A second theme to emerge from a review of research on the extended mind is its distinctive take on the nature of expertise. Traditional notions of what makes an expert are highly brainbound, focused on internal, individual effort (think of the late psychologist Anders Ericsson’s famous finding that mastery in any field requires “10,000 hours” of practice). The literature on the extended mind suggests a different view: experts are those who have learned how best to marshal and apply extra-neural resources to the task before them. This alternative perspective has real implications for how we understand and cultivate superior performance.</p>
    
    <p> For example: although the conventional take on expertise highlights economy, efficiency, and optimality of action—geniuses and superstars “just do it”—research in the vein of the extended mind finds that experts actually do more experimenting, more testing, and more backtracking than beginners. They are more apt than novices to make skillful use of their bodies, of physical space, and of relationships with others. In most scenarios,
researchers have found, experts are less likely to “use their heads” and more inclined to extend their minds—a habit that the rest of us can learn to emulate on our way to achieving mastery.
Finally, in surveying the study of the extended mind, there’s one more theme that is impossible to ignore: the matter of what we might call “extension inequality.</p>
    
    <p>” Our schools, our workplaces, the very structure of our society are based on the assumption that some people are able to think more intelligently than others. The reason for such individual differences is taken as self-evident:
obviously it’s because those people are smarter—because they have more of the stuff called “intelligence” inside their heads. Research on the extended mind points to a different explanation. That is: some people are able to think more intelligently because they are better able to extend their minds.</p>
    
    <p> They may have more knowledge about how mental extension works, the kind of knowledge that this book aims to make accessible. But it’s also indisputable that the extensions that allow us to think well—the freedom to move one’s body, say, or the proximity of natural green spaces; control over one’s personal workspace, or relationships with informed experts and accomplished peers—are far from equally distributed. When reading the chapters that follow, we should keep in mind the way access, or lack of access, to mental extensions might be shaping the thinking of our students, employees, co-workers, and fellow citizens.
Metaphors are powerful, and none more so than the ones we use to understand our own minds.</p>
    
    <p> The value of the approach described in these pages ultimately lies in the novel analogy it offers, an analogy we can apply to our everyday efforts to learn and remember, to solve problems and imagine possibilities. We extend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine or bulking them up like a muscle—but by strewing our world with rich materials, and by weaving them into our thoughts.
PART I THINKING WITH OUR BODIES 1 Thinking with Sensations DURING HIS YEARS of working as a financial trader at Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Deutsche Bank, John Coates watched it happen again and again.
“Using my best analytical efforts, drawing on my education”—Coates has a PhD in economics from the University of Cambridge—“and a wide reading of economic reports and statistics,” he would devise a brilliant trade, one that was impeccable in its logic and unassailable in its reasoning.</p>
    
    <p> And—it would lose money, every time.
Then there were other occasions, equally puzzling. “I would catch a glimpse with peripheral vision of another possibility, another path into the future. It showed up as a mere blip in my consciousness, a momentary tug on my attention, but it was a flash of insight coupled with a gut feeling that gave it the imprimatur of the highly probable.</p>
