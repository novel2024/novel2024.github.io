    <p> Most people often have no problem mingling with others and sharing bits of information about themselves. A high Mach will find this frivolous and unnecessary. Thanks to their emotional detachment, they have a hard time bonding and sharing with others. Also, since they believe that life is a game to be played and won, they are fearful of divulging any information that may cause them to lose.</p>
    
    <p> As such, they would rather hold people at a distance than let them in. High Machs also prefer to be feared than loved and hence do not have much time for hand-holding and other niceties reserved for friendships.
Unpacking the Dark Triad: Psychopathy Psychopathy is a personality trait that is characterized mainly by a lack of sensitivity towards others. Psychopaths hardly experience any empathy for others and will rarely feel any remorse even when they have hurt other people.</p>
    
    <p> There are numerous views in regard to psychopathy, but most of them seem to agree on the three main characteristics that distinguish a psychopath from any other normal person. These three characteristics include boldness, lack of inhibition, and meanness than any other person would find unbecoming.
Psychopaths are bold and fearless and are not afraid of venturing into unfamiliar territory even when there is potential danger awaiting them.
While other people are typically stressed by such situations, psychopaths will go about these circumstances as if they are carrying out their everyday tasks.</p>
    
    <p> Psychopaths will often have high self-confidence and social assertiveness that enable them to go interact with people without any of the shyness or anxiety that others might have. Often, when a gruesome crime is committed, you might hear of the details of the crime and shudder while thinking to yourself: how could a person live with himself after doing that?
For a psychopath, it is business as usual to murder someone and then grabs a sunny side up at their favorite cafe. This is not to mean that all psychopaths have murdered someone. Some psychopaths have rendered their lack of remorse and sensitivity to other crimes and transgressions instead.</p>
    
    <p>
Psychopaths exhibit poor impulse control in that they are unable to control their urges. When a normal person gets an urge of whatever kind, they are often able to put it under control and talk themselves out of that state. For example, if you are dealing with an annoying colleague who will just not shut up about their upcoming bridal shower, you will likely be able to fight the urge to punch them in their face. A psychopath, on the other hand, will often be overcome by impulse and react without thinking twice about what the cost of their decision will be.</p>
    
    <p> In simple terms, psychopaths are prone to snapping. Often when they snap, somebody gets hurt.
Common decency calls for a certain level of civility and kindness when dealing with others. This is not something that psychopaths care about.</p>
    
    <p>
While the rest of the population worries about caring and kindness, a psychopath will have no problem being the meanest person in the room.
They might be subtle or direct about it depending on the circumstances at hand.
Besides these three main areas of commonality in their personalities,
psychopaths also tend to have other distinguishing characteristics:
They are risk takers This is related to their boldness and lack of fear. While everyone else fears about their safety, psychopaths do not spend two seconds worrying about safety--theirs or anybody elseâ€™s.</p>
    
    <p> This trait is an advantage if it is used for good purposes. On the flip side, taking huge risks can be costly, especially if the burden of the risk is borne by somebody else. It is no surprise,
therefore, that psychopaths who have been nurtured in stable environments go on to become successful businessmen and politicians. After all, they are genetically predisposed to take all the big risks that will get them ahead in business and politics.</p>
