    <p> We’ll use this salt spoon. (He shifts it from hand to hand behind his back, then holds out two fists.) Take your pick. You get the spoon, you get the dining room.</p>

SALLY: You mean you want to start here?
ARTHUR: Got to start somewhere.
Even though the run of The Dining Room had ended five months earlier, and many of the actors had learned new roles since then, they still remembered the lines from Gurney’s play that had been accompanied onstage by movement or gestures (as when Arthur holds out the spoon to Sally). Lines they had delivered while standing or sitting still, the Noices discovered, were much more likely to be forgotten.
In other studies, the Noices have shown that connecting words to movements improves recall among people who are not actors—college students, for example, and older people residing in assisted living facilities.</p>
    
    <p> Most activities advertised to forestall age-related memory loss—such as crossword puzzles,
sudoku, and commercial brain-training programs like Lumosity—conform to our society’s brainbound model of how thinking works: users sit still and use their heads. By contrast, Helga and Tony Noice have found that moving the body makes an essential contribution to strengthening memory—and other mental capacities as well.
In a series of studies conducted with people aged sixty-five to eighty-five, the Noices instructed participants in professional acting techniques and then led them in the rehearsal and performance of theatrical scenes. Before and after the four-week-long program, they tested participants on general cognitive capacities like word memory, verbal fluency, problem solving, and handling daily tasks,
such as comparing nutrition labels, paying bills by check, and looking up phone numbers.</p>
    
    <p> Compared to people the same age who did not enroll in any program,
or who took part in activities that did not involve movement (an art appreciation class, for example), individuals who had participated in the theatrical program became mentally sharper. Participants were apparently able to borrow strategies they learned in acting class—such as linking movement to material to be remembered—and apply them to the activities of everyday life.
Similar results have been found among younger people; again, movement seems to be key to remembering. In a study of undergraduates published in 2001, for example, the Noices reported that the effects of physical movement “previously found after lengthy real-world rehearsal and repeated performances by professional actors could be produced by giving a few minutes of instruction to non-actors with little or no performing experience.</p>
    
    <p>” The difference such minimal instruction made in participants’ ability to recall information, they noted, was “striking”: students who incorporated movement into their learning strategy remembered 76 percent of the material, while those who engaged in “deliberate memorization” recalled only 37 percent.
The implications of the Noices’ research are clear. First: information is better remembered when we’re moving as we learn it. This is the case even when the movement is not a literal enactment of the meaning of the information to be recalled but simply a movement of the body, meaningfully related to the information and made at the same time the information is absorbed.</p>
    
    <p> Second:
information that has become associated with a movement is better remembered when we can reproduce that same movement later, when we’re calling it up from memory. This may be possible in some situations—for example, when giving a speech for which we have practiced accompanying gestures—but moving while learning is still beneficial even when those movements can’t be replicated at the point of recall (during an exam, for instance).
Indeed, simply forming the intention to move in connection with a piece of information seems to tag that information with a mental marker of importance.
Our natural egocentric bias leads us to preferentially attend to and remember that information that we have connected in some way to ourselves: my intention, my body, my movement.</p>
    
    <p> Concluded Helga and Tony Noice in one of their academic articles, “One might paraphrase Descartes and say, ‘I move, therefore I remember.’ ” Moving while learning can help us to remember information more accurately.
It may also be the case that moving while learning can help us understand information differently: more deeply, “from the inside,” as it were. A stray comment from an undergraduate working in her lab got psychologist Sian Beilock—then an assistant professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio— wondering about the body’s role in the act of understanding.</p>
    
    <p> The student played on the university’s hockey team, and he mentioned to his professor that when watching hockey on television, he seemed to understand the action as it unfolded in a way that was different from that of his friends who had not been out on the ice.
Beilock and her colleagues designed a study to test his impression. First,
experimenters read action sequences drawn from hockey games (“The hockey player shot the puck”) and from everyday life (“The child saw the balloon in the air”) to two groups of study participants; one group was made up of experienced hockey players, while the other group had never played the sport. Then participants were shown pictures that either did or did not correspond to the action sequences they’d heard (for instance, an image depicting a child seeing a balloon in the air, or a child seeing a deflated balloon on the ground).</p>
    
    <p>
For each sentence-picture pair, all the participants were able to correctly identify whether the two matched or not—but when the action concerned a hockey game, the hockey players were much quicker than their non-playing counterparts to make the identification; they exhibited what Beilock calls “facilitated comprehension.” Brain scans conducted on both groups showed that a particular neural region was activated more strongly in the hockey players’ brains than in the non-players’ brains when they listened to hockey-specific language: the left dorsal premotor cortex, responsible for executing well- practiced physical movements. This area isn’t typically associated with language processing, but the players’ personal history with the game gave them a body- based experience that they could connect to the words they heard. The surprising import of Beilock’s study is that people who have moved in different ways go on to think in different ways—an insight that can be applied well beyond sports.</p>
    
    <p>
The research on using movement to enhance thinking identifies four types of helpful motion: congruent movements, novel movements, self-referential movements, and metaphorical movements. The first of these, congruent movements, express in physical form the content of a thought. With the motions of our bodies, we enact the meaning of a fact or concept. Congruent movements are an effective way to reinforce still tentative or emerging knowledge by introducing a corporeal component into the process of understanding and remembering.</p>
