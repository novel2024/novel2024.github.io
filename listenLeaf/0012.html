    <p>As we navigate a new situation, we’re scrolling through our mental archive ofstored patterns from the past, checking for ones that apply to our currentcircumstances. We’re not aware that these searches are under way; as Lewickiobserves, “The human cognitive system is not equipped to handle such tasks onthe consciously controlled level.” He adds, “Our conscious thinking needs torely on notes and flowcharts and lists of ‘if-then’ statements—or on computers—to do the same job which our non-consciously operating processing algorithmscan do without external help, and instantly.”But—if our knowledge of these patterns is not conscious, how then can wemake use of it? The answer is that, when a potentially relevant pattern isdetected, it’s our interoceptive faculty that tips us off: with a shiver or a sigh, aquickening of the breath or a tensing of the muscles.</p>
    
    <p> The body is rung like a bellto alert us to this useful and otherwise inaccessible information. Though wetypically think of the brain as telling the body what to do, just as much does thebody guide the brain with an array of subtle nudges and prods. (Onepsychologist has called this guide our “somatic rudder.”) Researchers have evencaptured the body in mid-nudge, as it alerts its inhabitant to the appearance of apattern that she may not have known she was looking for.</p>
    
    <p>Such interoceptive prodding was visible during a gambling game that formedthe basis of an experiment led by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, a professor atthe University of Southern California. In the game, presented on a computerscreen, players were given a starting purse of two thousand “dollars” and wereshown four decks of digital cards. Their task, they were told, was to turn thecards in the decks face-up, choosing which decks to draw from such that theywould lose the least amount of money and win the most. As they started clickingto turn over cards, players began encountering rewards—bonuses of $50 here,$100 there—and also penalties, in which small or large amounts of money weretaken away.</p>
    
    <p> What the experimenters had arranged, but the players were not told,was that decks A and B were “bad”—they held lots of large penalties in store—and decks C and D were “good,” bestowing more rewards than penalties overtime.As they played the game, the participants’ state of physiological arousal wasmonitored via electrodes attached to their fingers; these electrodes kept track oftheir level of “skin conductance.” When our nervous systems are stimulated byan awareness of potential threat, we start to perspire in a barely perceptible way.This slight sheen of sweat momentarily turns our skin into a better conductor ofelectricity.</p>
    
    <p> Researchers can thus use skin conductance as a measure of nervoussystem arousal. Looking over the data collected by the skin sensors, Damasioand his colleagues noticed something interesting: after the participants had beenplaying for a short while, their skin conductance began to spike when theycontemplated clicking on the bad decks of cards. Even more striking, the playersstarted avoiding the bad decks, gravitating increasingly to the good decks. As inthe Lewicki study, subjects got better at the task over time, losing less andwinning more.</p>
    
    <p>Yet interviews with the participants showed that they had no awareness ofwhy they had begun choosing some decks over others until late in the game,long after their skin conductance had started flaring. By card 10 (about forty-fiveseconds into the game), measures of skin conductance showed that their bodieswere wise to the way the game was rigged. But even ten turns later—on card 20—“all indicated that they did not have a clue about what was going on,” theresearchers noted. It took until card 50 was turned, and several minutes hadelapsed, for all the participants to express a conscious hunch that decks A and Bwere riskier.</p>
    
    <p> Their bodies figured it out long before their brains did. Subsequentstudies supplied an additional, and crucial, finding: players who were moreinteroceptively aware were more apt to make smart choices within the game. Forthem, the body’s wise counsel came through loud and clear.Damasio’s fast-paced game shows us something important.</p>
    
    <p> The body not onlygrants us access to information that is more complex than what our consciousminds can accommodate. It also marshals this information at a pace that is farquicker than our conscious minds can handle. The benefits of the body’sintervention extend well beyond winning a card game; the real world, after all, isfull of dynamic and uncertain situations, in which there is no time to ponder allthe pros and cons. If we rely on the conscious mind alone, we lose.</p>
    
    <p>HERE, THEN, is a reason to hone our interoceptive sense: people who are moreaware of their bodily sensations are better able to make use of their non-conscious knowledge. Mindfulness meditation is one way of enhancing suchawareness. The practice has been found to increase sensitivity to internal signals,and even to alter the size and activity of that key brain structure, the insula. Oneparticular component appears to be especially effective; this is the activity thatoften starts off a meditation session, known as the “body scan.</p>
    
    <p>” Rooted in theBuddhist traditions of Myanmar, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, the body scan wasintroduced to Western audiences by mindfulness pioneer Jon Kabat-Zinn, now aprofessor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. “Peoplefind the body scan beneficial because it reconnects their conscious mind to thefeeling states of their body,” says Kabat-Zinn. “By practicing regularly, peopleusually feel more in touch with sensations in parts of their body they had neverfelt or thought much about before.”To practice the body scan, he explains, we should first sit or lie down in acomfortable place, allowing our eyes to close gently.</p>
