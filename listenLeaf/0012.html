    <p> This challenge can become a struggle if your frame of mind is incompatible with your adopted lifestyle. In other words, you need to believe in your lifestyle as an end rather than as a means to an end. To wit,
runners and other athletes sometimes get the reverse cum hoc ergo propter hoc comment that they're already fit, so they don't need to exercise. Yet their diligent exercising is exactly what causes their fitness.</p>
    
    <p> How is doing good, creating wealth, establishing connections--in short, accomplishing anything--any different?
Accomplishing something is more effective with a theory that is compatible with your reality. Such a theory must, like all theories, be built on principles that have been developed from understanding the patterns in observed facts. Here I seek to produce a map rather than a set of directions.
Directions are succinct and useful until you get lost or need to change your plans.</p>
    
    <p> Maps allow for optimization and the freedom to choose your destination, but they require navigational skills.
To navigate a map, you must first understand your present environment objectively; that is, your reality must match the reality. It would not be an exaggeration to say that anyone who has been brought up in our modern way of life knows very little about their environment, except a few particular details they need to operate some machine in a job, push papers around a bureaucracy, or manage those who do so. A broad view of the world is therefore described in The lock-in.</p>
    
    <p> You must then understand how your environment, your present position, and your destination relate to the map. You must understand how your environment affects your choices as well as your motivation for choosing. This is described in Economic degrees of freedom. To get somewhere you must have a deliberate purpose in mind and a vision of the destination that drives your actions.</p>
    
    <p> This vision is described in The renaissance ideal. To make deliberate choices, you must know how to creatively deal with your environment. Strategic choices relate present actions to future actions. A set of general strategies or guiding principles for maximizing utility and efficiency according to your values is given in Strategy, tactics, and guiding principles.</p>
    
    <p> Individual examples of tactics are given in A renaissance lifestyle. Since everybody's situation and goals are unique, these are intended more as examples that illustrate the principles of the previous chapters than as actionable to-do lists.
Foundations of economics and finance discusses financial independence and extreme early retirement. There is tremendous confusion as to what extreme early retirement means, most likely because only a minority of extreme early retires choose to replicate the lifestyle--usually an endless vacation--of those who defer their retirement to old age.</p>

This book gives you the tools and shows you how to use them.
However, it can't give you experience in using them, nor can it give you the courage to do it; that is up to you.
Barriers to change To change, many barriers must be overcome. Having previously overcome barriers, overcoming new barriers becomes much easier.</p>
    
    <p> You may want to cross-train for a new lifestyle by first completing a marathon, a PhD, or something equally arduous, like building a house of cards. The decision to overcome barriers can also follow from shocking events. For instance, many decide to become healthy after they, or someone close to them, experiences their first heart attack or something equally serious.
Similar epiphanies occur after temporary job losses during an economic crisis.</p>
