    <p> Keep in mind that many people never get to the second stage.
Sure, everybody probably compares themselves to others to some degree.
Keeping up with the Joneses is one such comparison, but such comparisons are comparisons in degree, not in kind. Sometimes, however, a person might realize that there's another way to do things, such as living without debt or taking cold showers, and that this other way is preferable and actually achievable.</p>
    
    <p> Often, though, the other way is simply dismissed as being impossible. The preponderance of people in stage one and two explains why advertising works.
In the third stage, the person is actively collecting ways of doing things differently. Many personal development books and blogs operate at the third stage, compiling large lists of tips and tricks, each describing a fragment of what constitutes good behavior.</p>
    
    <p>
In the fourth stage, the person is able to apply several of these tips to everyday life. For instance, the person will be able to make a budget and follow a plan. This stage is about implementing a plan. Many blogs, books,
and TV shows also discuss this stage.</p>
    
    <p> Stages three and four are mostly about the technical aspects, the journeyman stage, of mastery. They concern the nuts and bolts. Stage three is about collecting them and stage four is about pairing them together, screwing the nuts onto the bolts.
In the fifth stage, the person will be able to coordinate and refine different tips to achieve specific objectives.</p>
    
    <p> There are relatively few discussing this problem, which falls under general lifestyle design. These lifestyles share the commonality of being built out of existing ways of doing things. This is the master stage. Here, the whole lifestyle becomes one big "tip.</p>
    
    <p>" In the sixth stage, a person will be able to synthesize and create entirely new ways of doing things from seemingly unrelated concepts in a lateral fashion. The important becomes unimportant and vice-versa; usually this is manifested in a "return to the fundamentals", which--surprise, surprise--turn out to be of fundamental importance. Things become holistically and efficiently integrated with no superfluous expense of energy or money, and tactical side effects are either eliminated or made beneficial. This is the expert stage.</p>
    
    <p> At this point, the expert could be seen as copying other experts, but the expert is not copying what the others are doing, but rather what they are.36 Decoupling and increasing complexity Complexity provides an advantage over simplicity because of its greater functionality. To wit, more is possible using a set of tools compared to a single tool. Complexity allows understanding/manipulating/using the same thing in many ways,
which is useful for perspective,
and understanding/manipulating/using many things in the same way, which is useful for synthesis (by using analogous methods).</p>
    
    <p> Complexity, therefore,
results in flexibility. Increasing complexity always increases capability and adaptability. The human species is probably the best example of this.
Humans have the most complex brains of all species, and as a result, we've become the dominant species and been able to adapt to practically all parts of the Earth.</p>
