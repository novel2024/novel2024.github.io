    <p> Muir’s urgent message was received. Over the next few years, Roosevelt more than tripled the square miles reserved for natural forests, doubled the number of national parks, and established seventeen national monuments, including the Grand Canyon. Speaking to an audience in Sacramento soon after he parted from Muir, Roosevelt explained why the sequoias under which he had reclined should be protected from lumbering: “I hope for the preservation of the groves of giant trees simply because it would be a shame to our civilization to let them disappear,” he remarked. “They are monuments in themselves.</p>
    
    <p>” These and other “natural resources,” he continued,
should be “handed on unimpaired to your posterity. We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages.” The capacity to delay immediate gratification in favor of longer-term interests —what Roosevelt called “posterity”—is one that is strengthened by spending time in nature, research has found.</p>
    
    <p> Meredith Berry, a psychologist at the University of Florida, showed images of nature (mountains, forests) and of urban settings (buildings, roads) to study participants, who were then asked questions that measured their tendency to engage in “future discounting”—that is, to prefer a smaller payoff right now over a larger reward later. People who’d been exposed to pictures of nature were more likely to postpone gratification,
responding with less impulsivity and more self-control than people who had looked at pictures of cities.
Arianne van der Wal, a psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands,
asked participants in her study to walk through a green, leafy area of Amsterdam, or through a busy, built-up part of the city. Afterwards, she reported, the people who’d just experienced nature were 10 to 16 percent more likely to restrain their impulse to satisfy their immediate desires.</p>
    
    <p> Similar results have been found with children: kids aged eight to eleven were more capable of delaying gratification after watching a video of nature than after viewing a video about cities. When we see or experience an urban setting, we are primed to feel competitive, to believe we need to grab what’s available. Nature, by contrast,
inspires a feeling of abundance, a reassuring sense of permanence.
The orientation toward the future that is evoked by nature may also be related to the way it changes our sense of time.</p>
    
    <p> In another of Berry’s studies,
participants were asked to estimate how many seconds or minutes had passed in a given period; people who had just viewed scenes of nature, she found,
perceived time as passing more slowly. Likewise, research has demonstrated that people who take a walk in a natural setting overestimate how long the walk lasted, while people who have walked in an urban setting accurately estimate the amount of time that elapsed. Our perception of time is malleable, subject to the influence of situational cues; by reducing our arousal and increasing our attentional capacity, exposure to nature grants us a more expansive sense of time, and a more generous attitude toward the future.
Nature may also lead us to think more creatively.</p>
    
    <p> Children’s play is more imaginative when they are outdoors than when they are inside, research has shown; natural play spaces are less structured and more varied, and the props children may come across (leaves, pebbles, pinecones) have no purpose predetermined by teachers or parents. For adults as well, spending time in nature can promote innovative thinking. Scientists theorize that the “soft fascination” evoked by natural scenes engages what’s known as the brain’s “default mode network.” When this network is activated, we enter a loose associative state in which we’re not focused on any one particular task but are receptive to unexpected connections and insights.</p>
    
    <p> In nature, few decisions and choices are demanded of us, granting our minds the freedom to follow our thoughts wherever they lead. At the same time, nature is pleasantly diverting, in a fashion that lifts our mood without occupying all our mental powers; such positive emotion in turn leads us to think more expansively and open-mindedly. In the space that is thus made available, currently active thoughts can mingle with the deep stores of memories, emotions, and ideas already present in the brain,
generating inspired collisions.
Nature’s contributions to creative thought can be felt on a lunchtime stroll through the park.</p>
    
    <p> But there may be something especially fruitful about an extended foray into wilder terrain. David Strayer calls it the “three day effect.” Strayer, a psychologist at the University of Utah, had long observed that his most original ideas came to him on his overnight trips into Utah’s rugged outback. For a study published in 2012, he administered a measure of creative thinking to groups of hikers in Alaska, Colorado, Maine, and Washington state;
some completed the measure before setting off on their expedition, while others did so after they had spent three days in the wilderness.</p>
