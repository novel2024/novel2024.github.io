An implication that leaps out from this research: When demonstrations are incorporated into science class, students should not be relegated to the role of observer. Only those who physically participate will gain the deeper, from-the- inside understanding that comes from physical action. As education professor Dor Abrahamson puts it, “Learning is moving in new ways.”  YET ANOTHER TYPE of motion with the capacity to improve the way we think is self-referential movements: movements in which we bring ourselves—in particular, our bodies—into the intellectual enterprise.</p>
    
    <p> Though it may seem “unscientific” to place oneself at the center of the action, scientists themselves frequently use their bodies as instruments of exploration, imagining themselves as the object of their investigation. In so doing, they cultivate a kind of “empathy with entities they are struggling to understand,” notes Elinor Ochs, an anthropologist who has studied theoretical physicists at work in the laboratory.
The world’s most famous physicist, Albert Einstein, reportedly imagined himself riding on a beam of light while developing his theory of relativity. “No scientist thinks in equations,” Einstein once claimed.</p>
    
    <p> Rather, he remarked, the elements of his own thought were “visual” and even “muscular” in nature.
Other scientists have described the imagined acts of embodiment that helped them make their discoveries. Geneticist Barbara McClintock, whose work on the chromosomes of corn plants earned her a Nobel Prize, recalled how it felt for her to examine the chromosomes through a microscope: “When I was really working with them I wasn’t outside, I was down there. I was part of the system.</p>
    
    <p> I was right down there with them, and everything got big. I even was able to see the internal parts of the chromosomes—actually everything was there. It surprised me because I actually felt as if I were right down there and these were my friends.” Virologist Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, is another scientist who brought his body into his research.</p>
    
    <p> He once described how he went about his work in this way: “I would picture myself as a virus, or a cancer cell, for example, and try to sense what it would be like to be either. I would also imagine myself as the immune system, and I would try to reconstruct what I would do as an immune system engaged in combating a virus or cancer cell. When I had played through a series of such scenarios on a particular problem and had acquired new insights, I would design laboratory experiments accordingly.” While students are often encouraged to adopt a detached, objective perspective on science, research shows that they can benefit from engaging the “embodied imagination”—just as scientists do.</p>
    
    <p> Thinking and learning with our bodies takes advantage of humans’ fundamentally egocentric mindset. We’ve evolved to understand events and ideas in terms of how they relate to us, not from some neutral or impartial perspective. Research has found that the act of self-reference—connecting new knowledge to our own identity or experience— functions as a kind of “integrative glue,” imparting a stickiness that the same information lacks when it is encountered as separate and unrelated to the self.
Adopting a first-person perspective doesn’t mean we become limited by it;
indeed, using the movements of our own bodies to explore a given phenomenon seems to promote the ability to alternate between viewing it from an internal perspective and from an external one, an oscillation that produces a deeper level of understanding.</p>

Rachel Scherr, an assistant professor of physics at the University of Washington, has devised an educational role-playing program called “Energy Theater.” One attribute of energy that students find difficult to grasp, Scherr notes, is that energy is always conserved—it doesn’t get “used up,” but instead is converted to a different form, as when the energy in the coiled spring of a pinball plunger is converted into the energy of the pinball’s motion. Students may read about the conservation of energy in a textbook without truly grasping its implications; when, as part of Energy Theater, they embody energy, they begin to understand such implications in a visceral way. “Students who use movement to ‘become’ energy can fall back on the feeling of permanence and continuity conveyed by their own bodies,” says Scherr.</p>
    
    <p> “They don’t get ‘used up,’ and so they’re better able to understand that energy doesn’t, either.” Scherr’s research shows that students who have taken part in Energy Theater develop a more nuanced understanding of energy dynamics.
Another opportunity to recruit self-referential movement in the service of learning arises when students are endeavoring to understand the nature of complex, multistep, interactive processes—such as that bane of biology class,
mitosis and meiosis. The many phases and processes entailed in the study of how cells divide and reproduce can easily overwhelm students’ mental bandwidth,
leading to superficial comprehension at best and utter confusion at worst.</p>
