 Chapter 6: Defending Yourself Against Dark Psychology However much you might want to believe in the best of everyone, the truth of the matter is that we are all sitting ducks as far as manipulation goes.
There are people in this world who leave their houses with only the worst of intentions. Their intentions are to hurt others and to get the most they can out of other people without giving anything in return.
  The knowledge of dark psychology presented in this book is not intended to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
    
    <p> Rather, the main objective is to help you recognize manipulation in its various forms for what it is and if need be, to turn the tables to protect yourself. If you can manipulate a manipulator before they get the best of you, then that is a win for you and the rest of humanity.
Factors that Make You Easier to Manipulate Besides knowing how to identify a predator, it also helps to understand what makes a person more vulnerable to psychological attacks. Simply put,
there are sitting ducks that are closer to the line of fire than others.</p>
    
    <p> In Chapter 3: The ABCs of Brainwashing, we explored some of the factors that make a person more susceptible to brainwashing. However, we now know that brainwashing is just one of the ways through which people are manipulated. So, what makes a person vulnerable to all of the types of mind control and manipulation that exist?
You are Intelligent You are probably confused by this one because you have always believed that smarter people are harder to outwit, right? Here’s the thing though:
intelligent people like to use logic to aid their decision-making process.
Logic is easier to manipulate.</p>
    
    <p> Hence, intelligent people are more likely to manipulated when you corner them with logical arguments. Less intelligent people are harder to convince with logic and tend to be more stubborn in the face of facts and scientific arguments. It is no wonder that a whole lot of people who have been scammed by con artists and Ponzi schemes happen to be people who are relatively smart and who you’d not expect to be easily fooled. The reason why this is often the case is because scammers know to appeal to this kind of people with facts and statistics.</p>
    
    <p> People who are less smart will be easily dismissive of anything that sounds like hullabaloo because they do not understand it.
You are trusting and like to believe the best about everyone Believe it or not, there are bad people in this world. There are people who leave their homes every morning with the intention of harming others.
There are people who have no qualms about inflicting heartache and turmoil upon others.</p>
    
    <p> While you may be seated in your house worrying about mega rich corporations who steal from the poor, there is a boardroom full of corporate big shots who are about to steal from the very poor that you are worried about. Simply put, not everybody shares in your conscience and your empathy. People are wired differently. People on the dark triad are wired even more different than you could ever imagine.</p>
    
    <p> When you meet a new person, it is noble to want to believe the best of them, but it is wise to expect to be surprised in a not-so-great way. Keeping your expectations of people to a minimum is a great way to protect yourself against everyone that is trying to get a piece of you.
You are constantly seeking external validation When it comes to manipulation, a person that is constantly seeking validation from others is akin to a sheep walking inside a lion’s den. It is only a matter of minutes before the sheep is completely annihilated from the face of the earth.</p>
    
    <p> Manipulators are highly capable of noticing loopholes and exploiting them to their benefit. A big, glaring loophole for a manipulator is a lonely or insecure person who wants some companionship at whatever cost.
Everybody is prone to feeling lonely every once in a while. We are social beings, and in the absence of company, we can often feel unloved and dejected.</p>
