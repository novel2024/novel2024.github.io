    <p> Hence, employers can make the supply of labor more predictable by only offering full-time jobs, which makes employees unlikely to go home early, and tying in generous benefits, which makes employees unlikely to quit.
A loosely coupled system is less likely to fail. Loosely coupled systems have slack. They're flexible and resilient.</p>
    
    <p> This means that they function within a range of parameters rather than at just a single value. While slack in the steering of a car is not preferred, it is preferred, for example, in large organizations where tight couplings can lead to bottlenecks if there is only one person in charge of approving a specific form. Personal finance is another area where loose couplings are desired. For instance, a person who bought less house than he could afford is less likely to lose his home if his income drops or the cost of living increases.</p>
    
    <p>
It naturally follows that slack or loose couplings have a cost, in that they're less efficient under normal operations. Conversely, they're less costly under disrupted operations, such as in catastrophes. Changing the tightness or looseness of a coupling is therefore a way of adjusting risk versus profit. Here risk is defined as uncertainty rather than loss.</p>
    
    <p>
Linearity is different from coupling. The opposite of linear is nonlinear.
In general, nonlinear processes and activities have feedbacks which influence the process itself, changing it, while linear processes lack feedback. For example, consider a worker who is able to produce two unrelated widgets, A and B.</p>
    
    <p> If producing twice as many A widgets requires twice as much work and if the production of A widgets does not influence or depend on the production of B widgets in any way, the widget production is linear. When activities are linear, the result from adding activities or from increasing the effort is very predictable. Work can be very complicated, but still be linear. Surgery, for example, is linear.</p>
    
    <p> Twice as many surgeries take twice as many resources, and performing brain surgery on patient A is not going to speed up or influence the operation on patient B. The output is clearly defined by the input. Nonlinear activities have a less than clear relationship between input and output. This is because part of the output also acts as input; this part of input becomes new output which again goes back and influences the system all over again.</p>
    
    <p> Unlike the simple arrangement of a linear organization, a nonlinear organization can be very sophisticated. Consider a business which sells widgets A and B. It can distribute money between production, product development, and advertising. If widget A is advertised, it will influence the sales of both widgets A and B through brand name association, but decrease product development and possibly production.</p>
    
    <p> Yet if sales increase, it will allow economy of scale savings on the production. Estimating the output based on the input is difficult.
The best general example of linearity is assembly work. Linear assembly work turns specific inputs into specific outputs, always.</p>
