    <p> This is particularly true since many capital assets are just sitting around, serving no purpose most of the time (see How to get rid of things).52 Conversely, if a job is going to be repeated often, it makes sense to buy a labor-saving device. Ignoring skill for the moment, the simple trade-off between capital and labor suggests an arrangement such as that in this figure.
This figure shows total cost as a function of rate of use.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, once a month baking warrants a pair of forks tied together,
whereas baking daily warrants a hand mixer. Specifically, anything used less than once a month warrants improvisation.
Skill serves to shift the line in the figure down and to the left because skill makes the use of time and capital more efficient. Except at a very high level, maintaining skill has no cost, so if something is learned once, no further effort is required.</p>
    
    <p> In this case it's sensible to develop a skill to just before the point that it begins to require maintenance, continued practice-- beyond this point, replacing skill and time with capital assets makes more sense.
The skill component is something that consumers frequently misunderstand. A skilled response can easily be many times more efficient than an unskilled response. Conversely, the same ratio doesn't hold in terms of capitalization.</p>
    
    <p> For example, an expensive car won't be much faster than an inexpensive one. In the example of this figure, a whisk will only be a few minutes slower than a hand mixer, not counting the time one must work to earn the money for a hand mixer.
Consider the difference between an experienced swimmer and a beginning swimmer. The former is fast and the latter is slow.</p>
    
    <p> This, however,
doesn't mean that the faster swimmer expends much more energy than the slow swimmer. The experienced swimmer is much much efficient and seemingly glides through the water, whereas the beginner is inefficient and struggles just to keep his head afloat. Money-handling skills are very similar. The experienced money handler knows exactly where and how to spend money to get the maximum out of it.</p>
    
    <p> An unskilled money handler spends money everywhere, too much on some things, too little on other things, with much going to waste.
Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle One popular psychological strategy is to set small goals or start slowly.
Slow change is comfortable change. However, the cynic may observe that with an eternal series of baby steps, nothing much actually changes.</p>
    
    <p> This strategy usually fails from the lack of meaningful progress despite having achieved several small goals.53 There's a good reason for this. The S-curve or logistic function shown in this figure is a useful model to explain why this strategy rarely brings the intended results.
This figure shows a sigmoid s-curve which can be used as a model to describe "return on effort" in terms of "effort" for many different kinds of "effort.</p>
    
    <p>" For example, "return on effort" could be happiness and "effort" could be salary. Note that the curve is symmetric around the origin and that its rate of change is fastest at the origin.
Here the vertical axis describes the "return on effort" and the horizontal axis describes the "effort." Here "effort" measures some kind of input and return measures some kind of output.</p>
