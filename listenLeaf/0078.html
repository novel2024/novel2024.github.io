    <p>” His “morale skyrocketed,” he recalled, as the pieces quite literally came together before his eyes. Just then his partner, Crick, made his appearance, and Watson wasted no time in announcing the breakthrough:
“Upon his arrival Francis did not get more than halfway through the door before I let loose that the answer to everything was in our hands.” The final step of Watson and Crick’s long journey of discovery demonstrates the value of what psychologists call interactivity: the physical manipulation of tactile objects as an aid to solving abstract problems. The fact that Watson had to make his models himself is telling.</p>
    
    <p> Outside the architect’s studio—or the kindergarten classroom—interactivity is not widely employed; our assumption that the brain operates like a computer has led us to believe that we need only input the necessary information in order to generate the correct solution. But human minds don’t work that way, observes Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau, a professor of psychology at Kingston University in the UK. The computer analogy “implies that simulating a situation in your head while you think is equivalent to living through that situation while you think,” he writes. “Our research strongly challenges this assumption.</p>
    
    <p> We show instead that people’s thoughts, choices, and insights can be transformed by physical interaction with things. In other words, thinking with your brain alone—like a computer does—is not equivalent to thinking with your brain, your eyes, and your hands.” A series of studies conducted by Vallée-Tourangeau and his colleagues all follow a similar pattern. Experimenters pose a problem; one group of problem solvers is permitted to interact physically with the properties of the problem; a second group must think through the problem in their heads.</p>
    
    <p> Interactivity “inevitably benefits performance,” he reports. This holds true for a wide variety of problem types—from basic arithmetic, to complex reasoning, to planning for future events, to solving creative “insight” problems. People who are permitted to manipulate concrete tokens representing elements of the problem to be solved bear less cognitive load and enjoy increased working memory. They learn more,
and are better able to transfer their learning to new situations.</p>
    
    <p> They are less likely to engage in “symbol pushing,” or moving numbers and words around in the absence of understanding. They are more motivated and engaged, and experience less anxiety. They even arrive at correct answers more quickly. (As the title of one of Vallée-Tourangeau’s studies puts it, “Moves in the World Are Faster Than Moves in the Head.</p>
    
    <p>”) Given the demonstrated benefits of interactivity, why do so many of us continue to solve problems with our heads alone? Blame our entrenched cultural bias in favor of brainbound thinking, which holds that the only activity that matters is purely mental in kind. Manipulating real-world objects in order to solve an intellectual problem is regarded as childish or uncouth; real geniuses do it in their heads.
This persistent oversight has occasionally been the cause of some irritated impatience among those who do recognize the value of externalization and interactivity. There’s a classic story, for example, concerning the theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, who was as well known for authoring popular books such as Surely You’re Joking, Mr.</p>
    
    <p> Feynman! as for winning the Nobel Prize (awarded to him and two colleagues in 1965). In a post-Nobel interview with the historian Charles Weiner, Weiner referred in passing to a batch of Feynman’s original notes and sketches, observing that the materials represented “a record of the day-to-day work” done by the physicist. Instead of simply assenting to Weiner’s remark, Feynman reacted with unexpected sharpness.
“I actually did the work on the paper,” he said.</p>
    
    <p>
“Well,” Weiner replied, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.” Feynman wasn’t having it.
“No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working.</p>
