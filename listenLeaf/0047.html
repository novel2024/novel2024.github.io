advance knowledge and the sciences.
be an accomplished author and poet.
For our modern purposes, the fields can perhaps be grouped into seven generic fields--physiological, economical, intellectual, emotional, social,
technical, and ecological. Initially, it may seem overwhelming to master such a wide array of subjects, and perhaps the idea is even incompatible with your personal preferences.</p>
    
    <p> However, the universal ideal doesn't require total mastery of a subject; it only aspires to it. Keep in mind that effort and results are not linearly related over the entire range (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle and this figure). Ideally, effort should be spread equally between all subjects, though due to personal preferences and talents a person may decide to focus more on some areas than others.
Physiological Many people spend more time maintaining their house and car than they do their health.</p>
    
    <p> Too many forget that they live in their body first and their home second. To be at home in the world is first to be at home in the body.
After all, where else are you going to live? Hence, taking care of the body should take priority over taking care of the rest of the world.
For some reason, many people give up entirely on physical activity after leaving college, thus commencing an ongoing physical decline, losing muscle and bone mass from their thirties until their death due to inactivity.</p>
    
    <p>
It is common for a trained 60-year-old to be in better physical shape than a sedentary 30-year-old.
Physiological goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to maintain optimal levels of physical and mental health.
know how the human body functions and physiologically adapts to imposed demands like stress, overeating, lack of exercise and their opposites.
know why and which kinds of food promote health and which kinds of food destroy health, and why.</p>
    
    <p>
maintain good eating habits and the discipline to avoid destructive foods. Know how to preserve food and how to tell when food is spoiled.
be able to compete in local sports competitions (does not include jogging/walking a 4+-hour marathon). Those who focus on sports rather than one of the other five areas should eventually be able to compete on a regional level.</p>
    
    <p>
be able to perform physically while exhausted, hungry, or tired. Be able to perform under the worst conditions such as carrying an unconscious person out of a burning house or pulling oneself up while hanging from a gutter in case of a fall, or similar real-life demands.
Know at least basic first aid.
Intellectual Throughout their education (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle), people have been told what to think, and throughout their careers (see Career) they have been told what to do and what to say.</p>
    
    <p> Being constantly bombarded with "facts" and opinions, many people simply adopt them as their own (see Succession and the cycle of change). Most people therefore do not think for themselves, but rely on others to do it for them. Consequently, many people follow authority, rely on experts, and get their opinions from pundits and the Internet.
Critical thinking doesn't come naturally.</p>
    
    <p> It is a discipline that can be learned, but unfortunately schools don't seem to do a good job of teaching it. When critical thinking is taught, it's typically compartmentalized to the student's particular specialization. Consequently, a person may be able to think critically when it comes to the life cycle of the fruit fly or late 19th century Indian fiction (see The cost of specialization), but is otherwise unable to apply the methods elsewhere, because the general principles of rational thought are not taught. Yet without critical thinking skills, there's no way of correctly solving problems yourself (see Building blocks) and no way of critically questioning your life and your surroundings.</p>
