    <p> The chapters on brainwashing and hypnosis are particularly useful if you want to refresh your memory on the many ways people are controlling your mind against your will.
This book is not a call for you to live nervously and in fear. Bad things and bad people have existed since the beginning of time, and this did not stop billions of people from living their lives to the fullest. As much as this book calls for your guard to be up as far as keeping out the predators, it is also an assurance that you can let your hair down once in a while.</p>
    
    <p> As long as you know whoâ€™s hunting you and how they are hunting you, you can give allow yourself to relax when the predators are away.
Lastly, should you wish to flip the tables on the predator, you can go ahead and apply any of the tactics suggested in the book. Just make sure that you can deal with your conscience after the fact. The reason why psychopaths are able to sleep soundly at night after doing something bad to someone is because they do not have a conscience to keep them awake.</p>
    
    <p> And who said you could only use dark psychology to go bad anyway? If you can hypnotize your boss into giving you a raise or a promotion, more power to you!
