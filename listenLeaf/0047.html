    <p> Forty-two million people visit New York’s Central Park each year—ambling across its wide Sheep Meadow, browsing its fragrant gardens,
circling its shimmering reservoir. Why are so many drawn to these 840 acres? Its creator knew the reason. “Natural scenery,” wrote landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, “employs the mind without fatigue and yet enlivens it; and thus,
through the influence of the mind over the body, gives the effect of refreshing rest and reinvigoration to the whole system.” Residents and tourists alike love Central Park’s rolling hills, copses of trees,
and dappled bodies of water.</p>
    
    <p> But though the park’s features look natural, they were in fact almost entirely man-made. When Olmsted started his work in 1858,
the piece of land with which he had to contend was an unpromising expanse of swamps and rocky outcroppings, available for parkland only because real estate developers could not build on it. Over the course of the next fifteen years, more than three thousand laborers moved some 10 million cartloads of rocks and dirt,
and planted an estimated 5 million trees and shrubs, in service to Olmsted’s vision. That vision was drawn from the visits Olmsted made to legendary estates in England, such as Birkenhead Park and Trentham Gardens, which had themselves been contrived by landscape architects in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>
    
    <p>
The preferences around which Olmsted was shaping Central Park were older still—ancient, in fact, reaching back to humanity’s early days on the African savanna. The particular environment in which our species evolved left us with a set of predilections that persist to this day. For it’s not just any kind of nature that appeals to us. Much of what is natural is unpleasant or even threatening:
predators, storms, deserts, swamps.</p>
    
    <p> In order to survive, humans evolved strong,
and shared, preferences for certain kinds of natural spaces—spaces that look safe and resource-rich. We like wide grassy expanses, dotted by loose clumps of trees with spreading branches, and including a nearby source of water. We like the capacity to see long distances in many directions from a protected perch, aspects that geographer Jay Appleton memorably named “prospect” and “refuge.” And we like a bit of mystery—a beckoning promise of more to be revealed around the bend.</p>
    
    <p>
The world’s greatest landscape designers intuited these preferences and incorporated them into their work. Starting in the mid-eighteenth century,
Lancelot Brown—better known by his nickname, “Capability”—transformed more than 250 English estates, moving hills and planting trees in order to achieve his vision of an idealized countryside. Brown was succeeded by another British landscape architect, Humphry Repton, who drew “before” and “after” sketches for prospective clients; the “after” pictures promised shady clusters of trees giving way to views of open meadows and glimmering ponds.
Repton’s and Brown’s designs inspired Frederick Law Olmsted, along with many others, but they were no mere fashion.</p>
    
    <p> The preferences they elevate transcend time, culture, and nationality. They are shared by people all over the world—from Australia to Argentina, from Nigeria to Korea—including people who must go to great lengths to emulate the archetype. Landowners in the bone- dry southwest United States irrigate their properties to evoke the lush, grassy savanna. Gardeners in Japan prune their trees so that the boughs resemble the spreading branches of the trees of East Africa.</p>
    
    <p> Such choices reflect the brain’s very particular evolved history—the “ghosts of environments past,” in the phrase of biologist Gordon Orians.
What we imagine to be aesthetic preferences are really survival instincts honed over millennia, instincts that helped us find promising places to forage and to rest. When, today, we turn to nature when we’re stressed or burned out— when we take a walk through the woods or gaze out at the ocean’s rolling waves —we are engaging in what one researcher calls “environmental self-regulation,” a process of psychological renewal that our brains cannot accomplish on their own.
 IT’S NOT SIMPLY that we prefer such settings.</p>
    
    <p> They actually help us to think better —in part by relieving our stress and reestablishing our mental equilibrium.
Drivers who travel along tree-lined roads, for example, recover more quickly from stressful experiences, and handle emerging stresses with more calm, than do people who drive along roads crowded with billboards, buildings, and parking lots. Laboratory studies of people who are given a challenging math test or are subjected to sharp questioning by a panel of judges report that subsequent contact with nature calms their nervous system, returning them to a state of psychological balance in the wake of such trying experiences. The more stressed individuals are, the more benefit they derive from exposure to nature.</p>
