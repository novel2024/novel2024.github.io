    <p> The more accurate their guesses, as gauged by a wireless sensor placed on the chest,
the more game points they accrued. Fenton-O’Creevy reports that repeated play appears to produce lasting improvements in participants’ interoceptive awareness.
This approach suggests a novel way to support smart decision making: not through the application of painstaking deliberation and analysis, but through the cultivation of what we might call “interoceptive learning.” This is a process of learning, first, how to sense, label, and regulate our internal signals—and second, how to draw connections between the particular sensations we feel within and the pattern of events we encounter in the world.</p>
    
    <p> When we feel a flutter in the stomach as we embark on a certain course of action, what consequences seem to follow? When we feel our heart leap at the thought of one option before us, and our heart sink at the mention of another, what does that portend for the choice we ultimately make?
We can clarify and codify the body’s messages by keeping an “interoceptive journal”—a record of the choices we make, and how we felt when we made them. Each journal entry has three parts. First, a brief account of the decision we’re facing. Second, a description—as detailed and precise as possible—of the internal sensations we experience as we contemplate the various options available.</p>
    
    <p> An interoceptive journal asks us to consider the paths that lie before us, one by one, and take note of how we feel as we imagine choosing one path over another. The third section of the journal entry is a notation of the choice on which we ultimately settle, and a description of any further sensations that arise upon our making this final selection.
Once you know how a particular decision turned out—Did the investment make money? Did the new hire work out? Was the out-of-town trip a good idea?
—you can return to the record of the moment when you made that choice. Over time, you may perceive that these moments arrange themselves into a pattern.</p>

time, you may perceive that these moments arrange themselves into a pattern.
Perhaps you’ll see in retrospect that you experienced a constriction in your chest when you contemplated a course of action that would, in fact, have led to disappointment—but that you felt something subtly different, a lifting and opening of the ribcage, when you considered an approach that would prove successful. Such distinctions are delicate and fleeting; an interoceptive journal can help us fix them in place long enough to see them clearly.
 THE BODY, THEN, can act as a sagacious guide to good decision making—in the words of John Coates, as an “éminence grise,” more knowledgeable and judicious than the easily overwhelmed conscious mind.</p>
    
    <p> The body and its interoceptive capacities can also play another role: as the coach who pushes us to pursue our goals, to persevere in the face of adversity, to return from setbacks with renewed energy. In a word, an awareness of our interoception can help us become more resilient.
This may seem surprising. If there’s any human capacity that calls for mind over matter, the mental over the corporeal, it would seem to be resilience.</p>
    
    <p> We think of ourselves as deciding to grit it out, as resolving to exert willpower, often over the protests of an unwilling body. But, in fact, resilience is rooted in our awareness of the sensations that originate in our organs and extremities—and the more alert we are to these inner signals, the more resilient we are able to be in the face of life’s hardships.
The reason for this: every action we take requires the expenditure of scarce,
precious energy. On a level below awareness, we’re constantly keeping tabs on how much energy we have on hand and how much energy we will need to take the actions the world demands of us.</p>
    
    <p> Interoception acts as a continually updated gauge of our present status. Its cues let us know when we can push ourselves and when we have to give ourselves a rest. They help us match our effort to the magnitude of the challenge and pace ourselves so that we can see it through to the end. And just as some people are better than others at using bodily sensations to guide their decisions, some people are better than others at using interoceptive signals to monitor and manage their moment-by-moment expenditure of energy.</p>

Martin Paulus is a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who investigates the role of interoception in promoting resilience. In a study he conducted in 2016, Paulus gave participants a list of statements like these, asking them to agree or disagree with each one:
 I can deal with whatever comes my way.
I tend to bounce back after a hardship or illness.
I give my best effort, no matter what.</p>
