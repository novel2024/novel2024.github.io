Step 8: Release of guilt At this point, the victim is feeling a little bit relieved to realize that he is not inherently wrong; rather, it is his beliefs that are wrong. By dissociating himself with his beliefs, he can be right again. He releases his guilt by giving up everything and anything that is tied to his wrong beliefs, including those closest to him. He confesses the errors of his past ways and is ready to take up the new belief system that is offered by the brainwasher.</p>

Third Stage: The Rebuilding of the Brainwashed Self Step 9: Progress and harmony At this point in the brainwashing process, the target is eager to redeem themselves and look good in the eyes of the brainwashed. As such, they will begin to rebuild a new identity that is based on the belief system offered by the manipulator. After going through the suffering and torture of the earlier stages of brainwashing, the victim is convinced that their old belief system will only bring them pain and guilt. They are happy to be rid of the old self and replace it with a new self, which is their safe haven from all their past and present suffering.</p>
    
    <p>
Step 10: Final confession and rebirth After accepting the new belief system, the victim often feels a sense of relief to be done with their past and all associated suffering. They will cling onto their new identity like the proverbial last raft on a sinking ship because this is the only peace they have known in a long time. At this point, the brainwasher has successfully managed to gain a convert, and might even hold a ceremony to welcome the new convert into the sacred inner circle. It is common for most victims to be completely isolated from their families at this point.</p>
    
    <p> They will have gotten it in their minds that they are now different people who must not associate with the bad things of their past. It is typically near impossible to convince a brainwashed relative who has gone through these ten steps that they have been brainwashed. The damage that has been done at this point is so immense that a do-over is an uphill climb.
Professional help may be sought to save a loved one who is brainwashed, but it is never a guarantee of success.</p>

A simple way to describe how the brainwashing process works are as shown in the table below:
Steps of Brainwashing Message to the Target Intended Outcome Step 1 You are not who you say you are Self-doubt Step 2 You are a bad person Guilt Step 3 You need to agree with me that you are bad Intimidation and guilt Step 4 You are completely unaware of what you are Confusion and disorientation Step 5 I can save you Loyalty to brainwasher Step 6 You can save yourself Compliance Step 7 This is why you are suffering Blaming the belief system Step 8 It’s not you; it’s what you believe in Exoneration Step 9 If you want to feel better and be better, choose well Indoctrination Step 10 You are now good Acceptance and relief  Fig 1: Table illustrating the ten steps involved of brainwashing (Source: Robert Jay Lifton) The ten steps of brainwashing are credited to Robert Jay Lifton, an American psychiatrist, and pioneer of thought reform studies. Lifton interviewed prisoners of war and wrote about the psychological effects of the experiences they had undergone.
What Makes a Person Susceptible to Brainwashing?
What makes one person more vulnerable to brainwashing than the next person? Have you ever wondered why some people seem to be recruited into radical cults more easily than others? There are reasons for this.
There are some people who through one reason or another have a weak sense of identity.</p>
    
    <p> A person is not born with an identity; self-identity is something that develops over time as a baby grows through childhood and into adulthood. Self-identity is molded by the associations that a person has, the things they do, and even the choices they make. If a person is unable to define who they are convincingly, they are at a greater risk of falling prey to brainwashing. This is because they do not have an identity to protect themselves in the first place.</p>
    
    <p> A strong, solid sense of identity makes it harder for a brainwasher to tear you down.  For instance, if you strongly believe that you are a strong, confident, capable and caring person who is a believer and a good sister and mother, it is almost impossible for someone else to convince you otherwise. But a struggling teenager who thinks of himself as a loser will easily believe the misinformation that the brainwasher feeds him.
After all, he already has an extremely poor perception of himself and is most likely looking for a way out of his self-imposed psychological jail.</p>
    
    <p>
Another factor that makes an individual more susceptible to brainwashing is the absence of a support system. You can never overrate the significant role played by a community of supportive friends and family who rally around you in times of trouble. Unfortunately for some people, this support system is absent. In the absence of a strong circle of people looking out for you, a predator may swoop in and give you the community that you so crave for.</p>
