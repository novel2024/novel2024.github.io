    <p> Colleges and universities have responded by lowering academic standards and raising their prices, much like other producers of consumer goods and services respond to rising demand. This has resulted in an overabundance of college-educated people with useless degrees. This creates structural unemployment, which is generally bad for society, bad for the unemployed, but good for employers. Hence, the continued calls for more education, even though it's sometimes hard to see the reason.</p>
    
    <p> For instance, it's not unusual to see job advertisements along the lines of, "Must have a Bachelor's Degree and be able to lift 50lbs," to get a store manager job that would have been held by a high school graduate a generation ago.
Perhaps one will need a PhD just to man the cash register at a burger franchise one day...</p>
    
    <p>hey wait, what?!
As universities keep lowering their standards and thus decreasingly serve as centers of higher learning, they increasingly function as issuers of credentials, where students have little purpose other than trying to maximize their grade point average once they get in. Hence, admissions standards become the dominant factor. Consequently, universities focus on screening methods, while students focus on how to get around them. Many resources are spent on an endless war of attacks and counter-attacks as students and their parents attempt various strategies, including hiring highly compensated admissions consultants, to beat the admissions standards.</p>
    
    <p>
Many parents realize that their children will have an advantage if the children start building their résumé a little early, such as in preschool. In an effort to build credentials as early as possible, parents push their children into advanced classes, expect high grades, and call the children's teachers if they don't get top grades. Super-parents will put in any amount of effort to ensure their children's "success." At age three they'll send the kids to day care centers that command a heavy price to make the children multilingual and continuously engage them in mentally stimulating activities for eight hours a day.</p>
    
    <p> Parents will gladly relocate to another school district to ensure that their children go to the best schools. Parents will manage their science fair projects for them, projects that at the high school level are beginning to look more like undergraduate-level research projects, complete with outside collaborations. They will pay for tutors and test prep materials, the latter of which prioritizes cramming for and passing a test rather than learning the underlying material, and they'll make sure that little Suzy and Johnny have the correct solutions for their math problems if they can't figure them out themselves. Rather than being left to figure out their own playtime, children are pushed into highly structured, adult-supervised extracurricular activities which take up most weeknights, to pad the résumé with the awards and honors they need to make their college applications stand out amongst the thousands of others who follow the same strategy.</p>
    
    <p>
Once inside, the main mission has been successfully accomplished. This is the end of the journey rather than the beginning. Students just have to pass the time during four years of "edutaining" lectures on arcane subjects while maintaining their grade point averages like they did in high school,
dutifully cramming a few weeks before the examination date, only to forget most of what they learned as quickly as they memorized it.
If you are sufficiently smart and ambitious to get into a top-ranking university, the value added by the educational institution apparently doesn't matter for your future success.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, top-tier institutions don't add value to create talent as much as they select or discover it. Thus, if you were smart and ambitious enough to actually get into an expensive top-tier university, you don't actually need to go to a top-tier university to succeed in life.8 The ambitious and smart people realize this, drop out and go start their own companies. Those that are merely smart, stay, but quickly learn to select a college degree tailored to their desired job or income-level, and to select the courses with the highest grade-to-effort level in order to maximize what employers are looking for.</p>
    
    <p> I knew several people like that-- very boring people--they never knew anything outside of their textbooks,
and two weeks after an exam, they had forgotten practically all of what they had crammed for. Today, they're highly successful white-collar workers!
The educational system works, just not according to its stated purpose: to educate.
As students have come to view education as a product, and parents are still only a phone call away, professors are "encouraged"9 to make education "edutaining." Students now think that if they don't learn anything,
it's a failure of the teaching process, or the teachers, rather than their own failure to study.</p>
