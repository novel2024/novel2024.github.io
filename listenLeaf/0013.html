    <p> A familiar example is moving the body along a number line:
children who are learning about math benefit from taking steps on an oversized number line placed on the floor as they count or as they carry out procedures like addition and subtraction. Moving their bodies up or down the number line is congruent with the mental operation of counting up or down; taking small steps is congruent with the mental operation of counting one unit at a time, while venturing a bigger leap is congruent with the mental operation of adding or subtracting a number of units at once. Students who practice connecting numbers with movements in this way later demonstrate more mathematics knowledge and skill.
Moving the body in ways congruent with thinking is beneficial in part because it helps students make the tricky transition from the concrete to the abstract.</p>
    
    <p> This is the challenge facing children when they first learn to read: they must forge connections between the solid stuff of the world and the abstract symbols we use to represent it. In everyday life, children typically encounter the word “ball” or “cup” when there’s an actual ball or cup around, notes Arthur Glenberg, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. But within the pages of a book, words must be understood in the absence of such real-world referents.
Glenberg uses congruent movement to bridge this gap.</p>
    
    <p> His “Moved by Reading” intervention teaches children how to simulate (with concrete, physical action) the text they are reading (abstract symbols). Such simulation leads to large gains in learning; when children act out the words on the page, Glenberg has found,
their reading comprehension can actually double.
In one such study, Glenberg asked first- and second-graders to read stories about life on a farm. The children were also provided with farm-related toys,
such as a miniature barn, tractor, and cow.</p>
    
    <p> Half of the kids were directed simply to read the stories a second time. The other half were instructed to use the toys to enact what they were reading. After reading the sentence “The farmer drove the tractor to the barn,” for example, the child would move the toy tractor over to the toy barn. Youngsters who acted out the sentences were better able to make inferences about the text, and they later remembered much more about the stories than their peers who merely reread them.</p>
    
    <p>
Other studies have shown that congruent movements of this type can help children with math as well. In another of Glenberg’s experiments, elementary school students were asked to act out a zookeeper’s distribution of food to his animals while figuring out how many fish went to each of the hippos and alligators. Glenberg reports that the students who moved in ways congruent with text of word problems were more accurate in their calculations, and more likely to reach the right answer, than children who completed the problem in their heads. It seems that enacting the “story” told within the math problem helps students identify the information important for its solution: enacting made them 35 percent less likely to be distracted by irrelevant numbers or other details included in the problem.</p>
    
    <p>
Technology—which so often seems designed to keep us sitting still in our chairs, eyes glued to our screens—could extend itself with movement by incorporating congruent motions into the way it operates. And indeed, research using touch screen devices shows that digital educational programs that encourage users to make hand movements that are congruent with the mental operation being taught support the successful learning of those operations. A program offering instruction in number line estimation, for example—a task that depends on understanding numerical magnitude as continuous and not discrete— achieves better results when the movement required to interact with the program is a continuous one (dragging a finger across the screen) as opposed to a discrete one (tapping the screen once).
Another kind of physical action capable of advancing our thinking is novel movements: movements that introduce us to an abstract concept via a bodily experience we haven’t had before.</p>
    
    <p> Consider: When you step into your shower at home, how do you turn on the hot water? To answer that simple question, you simulated the familiar, well-practiced action in your head; maybe you even reached out and turned an imagined faucet handle. But how would you engage in thinking about an action you’ve never physically experienced? That’s the dilemma facing physics students, who are expected to reason about phenomena like angular velocity and centripetal force without a felt sense of what they’re like. Decades of research on physics education reveal the discouraging result:
most students never achieve a firm grasp of the subject. Some studies have found that students’ understanding of physics becomes less accurate after they have completed an introductory college physics course.</p>
    
    <p>
The conventional, and widely ineffective, approach to teaching physics is based on a brainbound model of cognition: individuals are expected, like computers, to solve problems by applying a set of abstract rules. Yet the fact is that—very unlike computers—humans solve problems most effectively by imagining themselves into a given scenario, a project that is made easier if the human in question has had a previous physical encounter on which to base her mental projections. Providing students with such physical encounters was the purpose behind a study designed by Sian Beilock, inspired by the work with hockey players we read about earlier.
In collaboration with Susan Fischer, an associate professor of physics at DePaul University in Chicago, Beilock designed a set of hands-on activities intended to introduce students to the forces they were studying in physics class —not as abstract concepts but as visceral experiences.</p>
    
    <p> One such activity, for example, employed a prop: two bicycle wheels mounted on a single axle, which could be held out in front of the body while the wheels were spun. When the axle was tilted from horizontal to vertical, the person holding it felt firsthand what physicists call torque—the resistive force that causes objects to rotate.
Beilock and Fischer asked one group of undergraduates to hold the contraption in their hands and to experience what it felt like to tilt the axle; a second group of students simply watched while someone else demonstrated its use.
Afterwards, members of both groups were tested on their understanding of the concept of torque.</p>
    
    <p>
Students who’d experienced torque with their own bodies, the experimenters found, achieved higher scores on the assessment. Their superior understanding was especially evident in their answers to the most challenging theoretical questions. What’s more, brain scans showed that when they were asked to think about torque, the region of the brain that controls movement was activated only in those who’d had a direct physical encounter with the force. Even while lying immobile inside an fMRI machine—or while sitting still, taking an exam—these students were able to access a bodily experience of motion, access that gave them a deeper and more accurate understanding of the concept.</p>
