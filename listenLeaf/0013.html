They are extremely charming A psychopath will put on their best suit, wear their best smile on their face and tell you everything that you need to hear, and you’ll never be able to guess that you heard it from a psychopath. Even though psychopaths are not able to feel or experience things the same way as everyone else, they are intelligent enough to know that people expect certain things to go a particular way. So, while your date may not really be falling in love with you after one dinner, they know that they are supposed to act as if they are.
Psychopaths are great students of life in that they are able to mimic normal behavior, thus allowing themselves to go undetected for the longest time.</p>
    
    <p>
Do not fall for the charm of a psychopath--it is fickle and comes at a high price.
They often lack long-term goals There is nothing thrilling about long-term goals, at least as far as the psychopath is concerned. Psychopaths live for the adrenaline rush of the moment and not the ten-year wait for a goal to materialize. The perennial bad boy who refuses to grow up and will not commit to a meaningful relationship could very well be a psychopath who simply cannot overcome his inherited genes.</p>

The Dark Triad Test The dark triad test is a measure of how one scores as far as the three personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. The test is often used in various settings and particularly in courts of law and by the police. Corporations also use the dark triad test to gauge their employees. The main reason why the dark triad test is applied is to determine an individual’s personality traits and possibly predict their behavior for purposes of preventing unsavory habits.</p>
    
    <p> It has been noted that people who score highly on the dark triad test are more likely to cause trouble and social distress be it in the workplace or even in their places of residence. At the same time, these individuals are also likely to have an easy time attaining leadership positions and gaining sexual partners.
The dark triad test requires you to answer a set of questions on various topics including how you feel about yourself and others, whether you keep track of information that you could use to hurt others and your general perspectives about life, death, and social interactions, among others. When self-administered, the dark triad test can be a fun way to gauge how you score on the dark triad test.</p>
    
    <p> When administered by courts of law and the police, the dark triad test may not be very accurate as the respondent may intentionally alter their answers so that they can look better than they actually are. This is a key limitation of the dark triad test. If you are interested in taking the dark triad test, there are several sites online where you can complete a test in a manner of minutes. Be careful about taking the results of the test too personally--sometimes the answers you give are based on the kind of day that you are having and not on the kind of person that you are.</p>
    
    <p> In any case, if you consider yourself a decent human being who always treat others with respect and has never and would never harm others,
then you should not worry too much about what a test says about you. On the other hand, if you always seem to run into conflicts and arguments and have to constantly talk yourself out of harming others, then a high score on the dark triad test might be the explanation you have been waiting for all along.
Dealing with Dark Triad Personalities They may not have taken the test and brought you the results, but you probably know a few dark triad personalities in your life. These are easy to spot.</p>

 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Brainwashing Brainwashing is perhaps one of the most intense forms of social influence in that it demands a whole lot of commitment from the brainwashed and the victim.</p>
    
    <p> Brainwashing, also referred to as mind control, thought reform or coercive persuasion, is not a technique that can be applied on a one-off basis with results. It requires consistent input from the manipulator up until the point where they are able to break down the victim to their desired results.
More likely than not, you’ve heard someone described as brainwashed. You may even have used the term yourself to refer to someone who expressed opinions that seemed too brazen to be true, that is obviously not their own.</p>
