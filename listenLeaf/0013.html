Barriers include not knowing about an activity or its benefits, the belief that the activity is difficult to engage in, social disapproval, or the belief that there are more benefits in continuing the present behavior. People will naturally choose activities that they believe to have high benefits and low barriers to entry--the quick and easy way to riches. Benefits and barriers vary significantly between people. To some, walking half a mile is fun, or at least as natural as putting on a pair of pants, whereas to others it represents a significant labor to be avoided.</p>
    
    <p> Some have the same aversion to merely getting up from the couch. Most importantly, the proposed behavior may compete with one or more other behaviors, where doing the proposed activity excludes another activity, or is simply believed to exclude another activity.
It'll often be the case that activities associated with the highest benefit,
such as moving into a smaller home or giving up personal car ownership,
also have the highest perceived barriers. In addition, choosing these activities means rejecting other activities, such as driving out to get a bottle of shampoo because you forgot to buy it earlier this morning and simply "need" it for tomorrow morning.</p>
    
    <p> Living in a small home means rejecting the pleasure of filling up rooms with stuff from the mall. Not surprisingly,
the most common reaction I get is, "This sounds a bit extreme," or, "This may be fine for you, but I prefer something that is more akin to what I'm currently doing." Hence, to convince you of something, I either have to convince you of the benefits of the proposed behavior (see Foundations of economics and finance).
the surmountability of the barriers to the proposed behavior (see A renaissance lifestyle).</p>
    
    <p>
the marginal benefits of the competing behavior (see The lock-in).
the foolhardiness of the barriers to the competing behavior (see The lock-in).
Many people associate their ideas and thoughts with who they are as a person. This is a significant barrier, since admitting that an alternative is better is perceived as a personal failure.</p>
    
    <p> Barriers are therefore raised to protect the ego and avoid a change of perceptions. This is done by adopting one of the counterstrategies to the list above. The most common counter- arguments are that the barriers to the proposed behavior are too high: "I can't give up my car." The second most common counter arguments are that the benefits of the proposed behavior are too low: "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have to go to work all day every day.</p>
    
    <p>" The third most common is that the barriers to the competing behavior are low enough: "I'm already doing it this way--I got too much invested already." The fourth most common is that the benefits of the competing behavior are sufficiently high:
"Although I'm miserable, at least I'm comfortable." This varies depending on who you are.
Barriers represent a cost which must be paid.</p>
    
    <p> The willingness to pay depends on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation,
vision of the future situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future situation. This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in the figure.
The volume of the pyramid represents the will to change from an unsatisfying situation to something else and depends on vision, how practical the change is, and the level of dissatisfaction with the situation.
Intuitively speaking, if either dissatisfaction, vision, or practical first steps are lacking, it's unlikely that action will be taken.</p>
    
    <p> Specifically: If dissatisfaction is low, obviously no change is going to happen. Why change strategy if you're satisfied with the way things are?
If vision is low, this can lead to a situation of comfortable misery where the vision isn't strong enough or too scary to allow change. A high level of dissatisfaction can be accompanied by low vision in cases of depression,
loss of faith or vision, or by external circumstances. For example, the mistake many make when becoming frugal is that they don't replace their previous vision of accumulating more stuff with an equally strong vision of doing something else.</p>
