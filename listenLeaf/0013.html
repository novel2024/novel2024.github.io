    <p>” When he obeyed these “gut feelings,” Coates found, he was usually rewarded with a profitable outcome. Against all his assumptions, all his training, Coates was forced to arrive at an unconventional conclusion: “Good judgment may require the ability to listen carefully to feedback from the body.” Further, he observes, “some people may be better at this than others.” On any Wall Street trading floor “you will find high-IQ, Ivy League–educated stars who cannot make any money at all, for all their convincing analyses; while across the aisle sits a trader with an undistinguished degree from an unknown university,
who cannot keep up with the latest analytics, but who consistently prints money,
to the bafflement and irritation of his seemingly more gifted colleagues.</p>
    
    <p>” It is possible, muses Coates, “though odd to contemplate, that the better judgment of the money-making trader may owe something to his or her ability to produce bodily signals, and equally to listen to them.” Coates shares these reflections in a captivating book, The Hour Between Dog and Wolf, which draws on his years as a trader as well as on his surprising second career as an applied physiologist. Over time, the questions generated by his work in finance—“Could we tell whether one person has better gut feelings than another? Could we monitor feedback from their bodies?”—became more compelling than the work itself, and Coates left Wall Street to pursue the answers in scientific research. He presented the fruits of his inquiry in 2016,
detailing the results of a collaboration with academic neuroscientists and psychiatrists in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
    
    <p>
Coates and his new colleagues examined a group of financial traders working on a London trading floor, asking each one to identify the successive moments when he felt his heart beat—a measure of the individual’s sensitivity to bodily signals. The traders, they found, were much better at this task than were an age- and gender-matched group of controls who did not work in finance. What’s more, among the traders themselves, those who were the most accurate in detecting the timing of their heartbeats made more money, and tended to have longer tenures in what was a notably volatile line of work. “Our results suggest that signals from the body—the gut feelings of financial lore—contribute to success in the markets,” the team concluded.</p>
    
    <p> Confirming Coates’s informal observations, those who thrived in this milieu were not necessarily people with greater education or intellect, but rather “people with greater sensitivity to interoceptive signals.” Interoception is, simply stated, an awareness of the inner state of the body.
Just as we have sensors that take in information from the outside world (retinas,
cochleas, taste buds, olfactory bulbs), we have sensors inside our bodies that send our brains a constant flow of data from within. These sensations are generated in places all over the body—in our internal organs, in our muscles,
even in our bones—and then travel via multiple pathways to a structure in the brain called the insula.</p>
    
    <p> Such internal reports are merged with several other streams of information—our active thoughts and memories, sensory inputs gathered from the external world—and integrated into a single snapshot of our present condition, a sense of “how I feel” in the moment, as well as a sense of the actions we must take to maintain a state of internal balance.
All of us experience these bodily signals—but some of us feel them more keenly than others. To measure interoceptive awareness, scientists apply the heartbeat detection test, the one John Coates used with his group of financial traders: test takers are asked to identify the instant when their heart beats,
without placing a hand on the chest or resting a finger on a wrist. Researchers have found a surprisingly wide range in terms of how people score.</p>
    
    <p> Some individuals are interoceptive champions, able to determine accurately and consistently when their heartbeats happen. Others are interoceptive duds: they can’t feel the rhythm. Few of us are aware that this spectrum of ability even exists, much less where we fall on it—so preoccupied are we with more conventionally brainbound capacities. We may remember down to the point our SAT scores or our high school GPA, but we haven’t given this particular aptitude a moment’s thought.</p>
    
    <p>
Vivien Ainley recalls a clear demonstration of this common oversight. Ainley,
an interoception researcher at Royal Holloway, University of London, was administering the heartbeat detection test to members of the public as part of an exhibit at London’s Science Museum. Visitors to the exhibit were instructed to place a finger on a sensor that detected their pulse; the readout of the sensor was visible only to Ainley.
“Please tell me when your heart beats,” she would say to each patron who stepped forward.</p>
    
    <p> An elderly couple who stopped by the booth had very different reactions to Ainley’s request.
“How on earth would I know what my heart is doing?” the woman asked incredulously. Her husband turned and stared at her, equally dumbfounded.
“But of course you know,” he exclaimed.</p>
