    <p> He recommends taking afew moments to feel the body as a whole and to sense the rising and falling ofthe abdomen with each in-breath and out-breath. We then begin a “sweep” of thebody, starting with the toes of the left foot. Advises Kabat-Zinn, “As you directyour attention to your toes, see if you can channel your breathing to them aswell, so that it feels as if you are breathing in to your toes and out from yourtoes.” After focusing on the toes for a few breaths, we shift our attention to thesole of our foot, the heel, the ankle, and so on up to the left hip.</p>
    
    <p> The sameprocedure is repeated for the right leg, focusing on each section for the length ofa few breaths. The roving spotlight of our attention now travels up through thetorso, the abdomen and chest, the back and shoulders, then down each arm to theelbows, wrists, and hands. Finally, the attentional spotlight moves up through theneck and face. If our attention should wander during the exercise, we can gentlyguide it back to the part of the body that is the object of focus.</p>
    
    <p> Kabat-Zinnrecommends doing the body scan at least once a day.The aim of this practice is to bring nonjudgmental awareness to any and allfeelings that arise within the body. In the rush of everyday life, we may ignore ordismiss these internal signals; if they do come to our notice, we may react withimpatience or self-criticism. The body scan trains us to observe such sensationswith interest and equanimity.</p>
    
    <p> But tuning in to these feelings is only a first step.The next step is to name them. Attaching a label to our interoceptive sensationsallows us to begin to regulate them; without such attentive self-regulation, wemay find our feelings overwhelming, or we may misinterpret their source.Research shows that the simple act of giving a name to what we’re feeling has aprofound effect on the nervous system, immediately dialing down the body’sstress response.</p>
    
    <p>In an experiment conducted by researchers at the University of California, LosAngeles, study subjects were required to give a series of impromptu speeches infront of an audience (a reliable way to induce anxiety). Half of the participantswere then asked to engage in what the researchers call “affect labeling,” fillingin responses to the prompt “I feel _________,” while the other half were askedto complete a neutral shape-matching task. The affect-labeling group showedsteep declines in heart rate and skin conductance compared to the control group,whose levels of physiological arousal remained high. Brain-scanning studiesoffer further evidence of the calming effect of affect labeling: simply namingwhat is felt reduces activity in the amygdala, the brain structure involved inprocessing fear and other strong emotions.</p>
    
    <p> Meanwhile, thinking in a moreinvolved way about feelings and the experiences that evoked them actuallyproduces greater activity in the amygdala.The practice of affect labeling, like the body scan, is a kind of mental trainingintended to get us into the habit of noting and naming the sensations that arise inour bodies. Psychologists recommend keeping two things in mind as we try itout. The first is to be as prolific as possible: the UCLA scientists reported thatstudy participants who came up with a larger number of terms for what theywere feeling subsequently experienced a greater reduction in their physiologicalarousal.</p>
