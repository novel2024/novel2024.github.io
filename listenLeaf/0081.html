    <p> Imitating the thought of other individuals courts accusations of being derivative, or even of being a plagiarist—a charge that can end a writer’s career or a student’s tenure at school. But this was not always the case. Greek and Roman thinkers revered imitation as an art in its own right, one that was to be energetically pursued.
Imitation occupied a central role in classical education, where it was treated not as lazy cheating but as a rigorous practice of striving for excellence by emulating the masters.</p>
    
    <p>
In the Romans’ highly structured system of schooling, students would begin by reading and analyzing aloud a model text. Early in pupils’ education, this might be a simple fable by Aesop; later on, a complex speech by Cicero or Demosthenes. The students would memorize the text and recite it from memory.
Then they would embark on a succession of exercises designed to make them intimately familiar with the work in question.</p>
    
    <p> They would paraphrase the model text, putting it in their own words. They would translate the text from Greek to Latin or Latin to Greek. They would turn the text from Latin prose into Latin verse, or even from Latin prose into Greek verse. They would compress the model into fewer words, or elaborate it at greater length; they would alter its tone from plainspoken to grandiloquent, or the other way around.</p>
    
    <p> Finally, they would write their own pieces—but in the style of the admired author. Having imitated the model from every angle, students would begin the sequence anew,
moving on to a more challenging text.
We know about the Roman system largely from the writings of Quintilian, the “master teacher of Rome.” Marcus Fabius Quintilianus, born around the year AD 35, headed a school of rhetoric that enrolled students from the city’s most illustrious families, including the emperor Domitian’s two heirs.</p>
    
    <p> In his masterwork, the Institutio Oratoria (subtitle: Education of an Orator in Twelve Books), Quintilian unapologetically asserted the value of copying. From authors “worthy of our study,” he wrote, “we must draw our stock of words, the variety of our figures, and our methods of composition” so as to “form our minds on the model of every excellence.” The educator continued: “There can be no doubt that in art, no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since, although invention came first and is all-important, it is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented with success, and it is a universal rule of life that we should wish to copy what we approve in others.” This system of education, founded on mimicking the masters, was remarkably robust, persisting for centuries and spreading throughout Europe and beyond.</p>
    
    <p>
Fifteen hundred years after Quintilian, children in Tudor England were still being taught in this fashion. A scholar and teacher of that time, Juan Luis Vives,
explained why imitation was necessary. While some basic capacities—such as speaking one’s native language—seem to come naturally to humans, “Nature has fashioned man, for the most part, strangely hostile to ‘art,’ ” he observed. “Since she let us be born ignorant and absolutely skill-less of all arts, we require imitation.</p>
    
    <p>” Vives had intuited a truth that cognitive science would later demonstrate empirically: many of the achievements of human culture do not come “naturally” but must be painstakingly acquired. The most effective way to take possession of these skills, Vives and others of his time believed, was imitation.
Then, as the eighteenth century was drawing to a close, the Romantics arrived on the scene. This band of poets and painters and musicians worshiped originality, venerated authenticity.</p>
    
    <p> They rejected all that was old and familiar and timeworn in favor of what was inventive and imaginative and heartfelt.
Their insistence on originality came in response to two major developments of the age. The first of these was industrialization. As factories rose brick by brick,
an aesthetic countermovement mounted in tandem: machines could stamp out identical copies; only humans could come up with one-of-a-kind ideas.</p>
