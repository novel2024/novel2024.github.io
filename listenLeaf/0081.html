    <p> It also won't depend on successfully starting your own business. You won't need to develop a particular specialized skill such as real estate flipping. In fact, if you have a job, keep it. However, using the methods in a way that aligns your goals and side effects persistently and consistently to achieve financial or job-independence is not easy.</p>
    
    <p> You must be willing to change your frame of mind and conquer old habits. In particular, you must be willing to do things that 95% of the population won't be able to understand and 99% won't be willing to do. This means that you must be exceedingly confident that you're doing the right thing, which is why 90% of this book is dedicated to the development of a coherent philosophy.
Freedom is attained by creating a large gap between production (revenue) and consumption (expenses).</p>
    
    <p> This can be done in two ways-- earning more or spending less. Nothing new there.
Which of the two you prefer depends on individual circumstances. If you're easily capable of producing more, you'll frame freedom as the opportunity to produce more.</p>
    
    <p> If producing more requires significant effort,
you'll frame freedom as not having to produce more. In an affluent and wealthy society, the latter is much more easily achieved by most, including myself. There was and is no way I could increase my income by a factor of four, but it was certainly possible to reduce my expenses to a quarter of their former level. I think this holds for the greater part of the bell curve of incomes.</p>
    
    <p> Unless you're very poor (income  <  $4,000  /  year) or very rich (income > $400,000 / year), boosting income is very difficult. If done intelligently, a little money will go a long way. Unfortunately, in this age money is rarely spent intelligently. So by practicing intelligent asset management, it's possible to live wealthily without spending nearly as much as the average.</p>
    
    <p>
On an absolute scale, spending less also allows for much greater choice in how you earn your money. Currently, the money I spend could be acquired through a part-time job as a burger flipper--just imagine the riches a full-time job could bring. Alternatively, I currently acquire my income as an amateur asset manager or capitalist using a little over five years of personal savings as my capital base (see Financial independence and investing). Since being a capitalist takes very little effort when you don't have to write progress reports or win new customers, I can dedicate most of my time to my primary passion, which is writing.</p>
    
    <p> The strategy described in this chapter focuses on living inexpensively in a culture dedicated to extravagance, productivity, and material waste. It follows these guidelines:
Reduce wants and needs from the marketplace to a minimum to decouple the buy-work connection.
Decrease the volume and size but increase the sophistication of your activities and possessions.
Measure prosperity by less activity, not more.</p>
    
    <p> Do fewer useless things.
Work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years of your life or five hours a week.
Avoid generating waste and find ways to use the waste of others.
Learn to use the system to your advantage, but don't be evil!
Serve yourself rather than having others serve you.</p>
