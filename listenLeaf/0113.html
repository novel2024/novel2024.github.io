    <p> Tony Schwartz, the founder of the consulting company The Energy Project, says that he and his staff members find their weekly community meetings “powerful” and “liberating,” even “transformational.” On surveys, participants in educational escape room activities describe the experience as “engaging,” “motivating,” and even “fun.” This is, to put it mildly, not the perspective most of us bring to group projects.
Group work is widely disliked, even despised, in both educational and professional settings; it is commonly viewed as inefficient, unfair, and just plain annoying.</p>
    
    <p> The research literature has even given this phenomenon a name:
“grouphate,” defined as “a feeling of dread that arises when facing the possibility of having to work in a group.” What explains the disparity between the productive, invigorating, even ecstatic ideal of group thought and action— which, as we’ve seen, human beings evolved to do well—and the dispiriting reality as most of us experience it? The answer may lie in a profound mismatch between the present-day demands of knowledge work and a set of ideas about such endeavors that is rooted deep in the past.
 THE LETTER TO Albert Einstein, dated June 4, 1924, began on a deferential note.
“Respected Sir: I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion.</p>
    
    <p> I am anxious to know what you think of it.” The author of the letter, Satyendra Nath Bose, was an obscure academic at a university in East Bengal. The paper he was sending to Einstein had already been submitted to— and rejected by—a professional journal. And the letter’s addressee “was not just the most famous scientist of his time; he was one of the best-known individuals on the entire planet,” notes Yale University physics professor A.</p>
    
    <p> Douglas Stone.
But Bose felt at ease reaching out to Einstein, he explained in the letter, “because we are all your pupils.” And so, with “some combination of veneration and chutzpah,” in Stone’s words, Bose went on to make an astonishing request.
“I do not know sufficient German to translate the paper.</p>
    
    <p> If you think the paper worth publication, I shall be grateful if you arrange for its publication in Zeitschrift für Physik,” he wrote, naming Germany’s leading physics journal.
Even more surprising, Einstein agreed to his entreaty. Reading the paper, he saw that Bose had solved a problem that Einstein had labored on without success:
how a law of radiation, formulated by German physicist Max Planck some twenty-four years earlier, could be deduced from the theory that light is a particle as well as a wave (a theory that Einstein himself had proposed in 1905).
It was, as Einstein wrote to Bose, “a beautiful step forward.</p>
    
    <p>” Bose took this step on his own, powered only by his own curiosity. It was simple, he later explained:
“I wanted to know how to grapple with the difficulty in my own way.” In 1925 Bose’s paper was published in the journal he had specified, Zeitschrift für Physik, along with a commentary from Einstein. It is not an exaggeration to say that the course of scientific history was altered by one man thinking alone.</p>
    
    <p>
Ninety years later, another paper was published. It documented a successive step forward in the discovery process to which Bose had made a signal contribution, reporting a newly precise measurement of the Higgs boson mass.
(Bosons, which were named in honor of Bose, are a type of particle that obeys the rule of what is called, in physics, “Bose-Einstein statistics”; their mass is measured by means of a particle accelerator, a gargantuan machine that propels charged particles to extremely high speeds.) The author of this paper was Georges Aad—and Brad Abbott, and Jalal Abdallah, and Ovsat Abdinov, and Rosemarie Aben, and Maris Abolins, and Ossama AbouZeid, and Halina Abromowicz, and Henso Abreu .</p>
    
    <p> . . on and on, for a total of 5,154 authors. The publication, in the journal Physical Review Letters, is but an extreme example of a trend now ascendant in every industry and occupation: in order to carry out the intensely complex work demanded by the modern world, people must think together in groups.</p>
