It's not necessarily optimizing or conforming to a set of measurable quantities like life expectancy or blood pressure, nor is it removing all symptoms using drugs. Health is the presence of something positive, rather than the absence of something negative.78 Moving It's generally realized that fitness involves some combination of diet and exercise. The diet quantity determines how big the body will be and the diet quality determines how healthy it'll be.</p>
    
    <p> The exercise quantity and quality determines its function, form, and health.
To understand how this works, think of the human body as being analogous to a car, with the exception that the human body over time is able to adapt its size and shape to external demands of diet and exercise (see Ergodicity and destiny). It becomes what it does. It is what it has done.</p>
    
    <p> In other words, by looking at someone it is possible to see how much and what they eat and what kind of exercise they do. Form follows function.
The couch potato Since there are many different human behaviors, human bodies come in many different shapes and sizes. A popular model now dominating two- thirds of the American market is the CouchPotato500, adapted to a sedentary life and capable of processing large amounts of Twinkies79 while sitting and staring at a monitor for up to 16 hours a day.</p>
    
    <p> The problem with the CouchPotato500 model is that it eventually requires prescription drugs to compensate for various system imbalances obtained from eating a diet of meat, starch, and corn syrup, drugs which require some kind of insurance scheme to keep personal costs down. It's typically in pain, being overloaded with weight, meaning more drugs and typically less activity, thus exacerbating the problem further. It then requires auxiliary motorized assistance to move farther than a few city blocks, something which is almost exclusively possible with personal car ownership.80 The runner Many then realize the importance of keeping "in shape," which suggests a specific body shape with a lack of fat in the wrong places like thighs, hips,
stomach, and upper arms, and muscle in the right places.</p>
    
    <p> For some strange reason I have yet to uncover, this often means putting on running shoes and going for a jog.81 For the overweight, restricting calories will effectively reduce body size. Yet many runners and other people who do several hours of aerobic exercise each week often suffer from "fat aerobics instructor syndrome," with deposits of stubborn fat in annoying places that just won't go away and even increase. The problem is that running or aerobic exercise in itself does very little for fat loss.</p>
    
    <p> Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this table) doesn't burn many calories--a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run--and it doesn't burn any energy after the run. In fact, it may even be detrimental.
Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the daily metabolic rate by 75-100kcal just to keep the muscle alive. It's thus clear that decreasing muscle mass is self-defeating as a strategy to fat loss.</p>
    
    <p> Indeed,
looking at experienced runners with their relatively spindly arms and legs with thighs no thicker than their necks, and soft and scrawny upper body,
it's clear that the adaptation to long distance--anything over a couple of miles--running doesn't get them "in shape."82 Furthermore, no activities in real life require jogging or rhythmically jumping around. Being pursued by a dog, you sprint. If you're moving far under your own power, you either ride a bicycle or you walk.</p>
    
    <p> Most activities require some combination of agility, strength, and work capacity. Yet aerobics, running, or jogging enhance none of these qualities.
The bodybuilder Even though things are changing, much modern strength training has been influenced by bodybuilding. Bodybuilding is primarily concerned with developing a certain look based on bulk, symmetry, and definition.</p>
