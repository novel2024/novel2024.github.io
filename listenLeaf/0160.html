(43) In fact, action in itself seems to be the cause of many problems.
Consider, for example, a middle manager eager to leave his mark on the organization (and his résumé) institutes some kind of organizational change. By itself, this isn't a big problem, but the combined impact of ten such changes from managers moving around in the system can ultimately be destructive to productivity. Perhaps a better example of this is the law or the tax code, which get incrementally more complex, though they don't reduce crime or make taxation more fair, respectively.</p>

(44) But put them on a bicycle, making it directly, physically obvious how much energy is wasted, and their behavior changes immediately.
Instead of tailgating, they hang back.
(45) This is similar to how many people consider a million dollar retirement portfolio a need. However, it's their want of a $40,000 retirement income that makes it a need and only that.</p>
    
    <p> It's not an absolute need.
(46) If you think this example is farfetched, you're probably older than 30.
(47) Maybe it could serve as a ramp of some sort for dogs?
(48) Conversely, turning a few old microwave ovens into a welding machine can be done faster than working to buy a welder outright.
(49) This is very true for programming.</p>
    
    <p> Once you have the right data structure for the problem, the program becomes much easier to write.
(50) This can be and was used to make laundry detergent which is as good as modern detergents but at 5% of the cost.
(51) Chlorine gas also burns explosively with hydrogen, much like pure oxygen. It was a combination of oxygen and hydrogen that blew the roof off the Chernobyl reactor.</p>

(52) Overcompensating in terms of quantity (rarely quality) is a popular pastime because it fits well with the accumulation culture. A dinner set for 12? Well, if you feed 12 people on a regular basis, of course it makes sense. If you only feed 12 people once a year, take them to a restaurant and feed them there. Alternatively, ask them to bring their own silverware.</p>
    
    <p> It is okay to break consumer customs.
(53) It will work given a lot of patience, but often this patience is hard to achieve.
(54) Note that since there are three terms--write out the parentheses--the shape of the solution can be controlled by just two parameters, for example, (dP)/(dE)=aP(1-bP), since the third would just act as a scale.
This means that two parameters can be used to fit the form of the curve to any problem whose structure fits this model.</p>

(55) Most people store their stuff in their main residence. However, other places include the workplace, which may be a good place to store your technical books or tools, or dedicated storage units. Renting a storage unit will very likely cost less than an equivalent apartment/house with one more bedroom.
(56) This is why, as a general rule, I restrict storage usage to 3/4 of full capacity; it makes it much easier to fit things in (see Decoupling and increasing complexity).</p>

(57) Effectively, only a fraction of the things we own contribute to our actual quality of life. These are the things we use on a daily basis (see How to get rid of things).
(58) If you want to get fancy, you can add inflation and opportunity costs.
However, the result will still be close to a couple bucks.</p>
