    <p> Research finds that people who are more interoceptively attuned feel their emotions more intensely,
while also managing their emotions more adeptly. This is so because interoceptive sensations form the building blocks of even our most subtle and nuanced emotions: affection, admiration, gratitude; sorrow, longing, regret;
irritation, envy, resentment. People who are more interoceptively aware can interact more intimately and more skillfully with the emotions that interoceptive sensations help construct.
But first—understanding the relationship between interoception and emotion requires correcting a basic misconception most of us hold about how feelings come about.</p>
    
    <p> The story we’re used to telling goes like this: on the basis of what’s happening to us, the brain determines the appropriate emotion (happy, sad,
scared), then directs the body to act accordingly (smile, cry, scream). In fact, the causal arrow points in the opposite direction. The body produces sensations, the body initiates actions—and only then does the mind assemble these pieces of evidence into the entity we call an emotion.
The pioneering American psychologist William James deduced this more than a century ago.</p>
    
    <p> Imagine you meet a bear in the woods, James wrote. Your heart pounds, your palms sweat, your legs break into a run—why? It might seem that it’s because your brain generates a feeling of fear, and then tells your body to get moving. But James suggested that it works the other way around: we feel fear because our heart is racing, because our palms are sweating, because our legs are propelling us forward. As he put it: “Common sense says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival, are angry and strike.</p>
    
    <p>” But, he went on, “this order of sequence is incorrect.” It would be more accurate, wrote James, to say that “we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble.” In recent years, scientists have begun to elaborate on James’s theory with the help of modern investigative techniques like brain scanning. Their research has confirmed that the thing we call “emotion” (and experience as a unified whole) is actually constructed from more elemental parts; these parts include the signals generated by the body’s interoceptive system, as well as the beliefs of our families and cultures regarding how these signals are to be interpreted.</p>
    
    <p> This perspective carries two important implications. First: the greater our awareness of interoceptive sensations, the richer and more intense our experience of emotion can be. And second: equipped with interoceptive awareness, we can get in on the ground floor of emotion construction; we can participate in creating the type of emotion we experience.
Psychologists who study the construction of emotion call this practice “cognitive reappraisal.</p>
    
    <p>” It involves sensing and labeling an interoceptive sensation, as we’ve learned to do here, and then “reappraising” it—reinterpreting it in an adaptive way. We can, for example, reappraise “nervousness” as “excitement.” Consider the interoceptive sensations that accompany these two emotions: a racing heart, sweaty palms, a fluttering stomach. The feelings are almost identical; it’s the meaning we assign to them that makes them, variously,
an ordeal to be dreaded or a thrill to be enjoyed.</p>
    
    <p> The one thing we are not, in such moments, is cool or calm—and yet most of us are convinced that when we are in anxiety’s grip, what we ought to do is try to calm down.
Alison Wood Brooks, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, had a different notion of how to handle nervousness. In a series of three studies, she subjected groups of people to experiences that most everyone would find nerve- racking: completing “a very difficult IQ test” administered “under time pressure”; delivering, on the spot, “a persuasive public speech about ‘why you are a good work partner’ ”; and most excruciating of all, belting out an 80s pop song (“Don’t Stop Believin’,” by Journey). Before beginning the activity,
participants were to direct themselves to stay calm, or to tell themselves that they were excited.</p>
    
    <p>
Reappraising nervousness as excitement yielded a noticeable difference in performance. The IQ test takers scored significantly higher. The speech givers came across as more persuasive, competent, and confident. Even the singers performed more passably (as judged by the Nintendo Wii Karaoke Revolution program they used).</p>
