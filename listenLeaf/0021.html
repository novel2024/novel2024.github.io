    <p> Your unconscious mind has already picked up signals that do not sit right and is sending you red flags for your own preservation.
 Chapter 4: The Truth about Hypnosis What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear of the term hypnosis? For many people, the answer is this: a Hollywood film with a terribly executed scene complete with a hypnotist and his mythical swinging watch. Across the hypnotist is the poor individual that is about to be sent to some place in their mind that they have yet to visit in over twenty years. The truth is that in the real world, hypnosis is less dramatic.</p>
    
    <p> In the simplest terms, hypnosis is a form of manipulation that involves reducing a person’s awareness of their external surroundings and heightening their inward attention. When an individual is under hypnosis, they respond to suggestions more favorably because their critical thinking is impaired. This is why the movies will show a subject responding unquestioningly to commands from a hypnotist.
  There is some science behind hypnosis, and it involves understanding how the human mind works.</p>
    
    <p> The human brain is structured in such a way that there is the conscious mind that controls critical thinking and the subconscious mind where memories are stored. The critical mind is what tells you that crossing a busy road without looking is dangerous and stupid;
while the subconscious mind is likely to tell you that losing weight is difficult because the memories of the last time you (unsuccessfully) tried losing weight are stored therein. Hypnosis works by altering the subconscious thoughts you have about certain things and replacing them with better and more beneficial thoughts.
Busting the Myths about Hypnosis and Manipulation It seems almost impossible to imagine that hypnosis is in use in our everyday lives, but the truth of the matter is that it is.</p>
    
    <p> You may not have any swinging watches thrust in your face, and your eyes might be open all the time during your waking time, but you are most definitely being hypnotized as you go about your daily life. How so?
When is the last time you read a really engrossing book that made you lose track of what was happening around you? While you were in that state of being fully absorbed in your book, you were essentially hypnotized. The high chances are that you were not even remotely aware of other people walking past you and going about their lives. Rather, you were on a train somewhere riding along with the thoughts and actions of the book’s main character.</p>
    
    <p> This is hypnosis in real life. No hypnotists and no watches-just you and your subconscious mind taking a trip to an alternate universe.
Self-induced hypnosis is also common in children who often slip into this state at least several times in a day. This is why you’ll call out to your child while they are watching their favorite cartoon series without any response.</p>
    
    <p>
They are not deliberately ignoring you. They simply cannot hear you because they have tuned out the conscious mind and world and are existing in a different world where they are fully attuned to the subconscious. Artists and athletes who need focused attention to perform excellently in their sport or art often also go into hypnotic trances during their performances. Many will refer to this trance as being ‘in the zone.</p>
    
    <p>’ What often happens is that the artist’s mind is so focused on what they are doing that nothing else matters during this period. Writers also get in the zone as far as the writing process is concerned. When this happens, you might find the writer transported into the world that they have woven with their words. Unable or unwilling to leave this world, the writer will churn thousands of words per day when they have previously been unable to go beyond a few hundred words thanks to writer’s block.</p>
    
    <p>
When it comes to manipulation and mind control, certain groups and individuals have mastered effective ways of utilizing hypnosis to their advantage. For instance, making a lengthy speech and holding a long and seemingly never-ending seminar both have the effect of sending the audience into a trance-like state. This may be because of boredom or tiredness or a combination of both. When an audience is in this state, they are more agreeable and likely to sign up for whatever it is that you are offering.</p>
