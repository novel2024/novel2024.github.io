    <p> If you ever wondered why your boss is incompetent or why it's so hard for you to advance, chances are that he started his career during a period of economic expansion, which required scraping the bottom for all the new positions to be filled, while you didn't, relatively speaking.
Salaried wages lead to an employer preference for longer work hours.
Also, employers have fixed costs and thus prefer workers to work the capitalized assets as hard as possible. By paying higher wages and limiting the number of jobs on high salaries, employers can make workers compete for these jobs.</p>
    
    <p> Advancement doesn't work on the model of a ladder as much as on that of a pyramid. As workers spend more time on the job, it leads to a dependence on the job, since little time can be spent on alternative pursuits.
Having several income streams is in fact highly dangerous to worker motivation. This is why capital income is generally cordoned off into special retirement accounts with penalties for withdrawal.</p>
    
    <p> This is also why many employers discourage workers from working competing or even noncompeting jobs. In addition, debt plays a major role in locking people into working for most of their lives. It used to be that marriage was seen as a lock-in: Unlike a bachelor, a husband would need a job to take care of his dependents. Today this is no longer the case and being single is more of a lock-in since the family income isn't diversified by a working spouse.</p>
    
    <p>
A consumer life is one of intense specialization. Most do a single job without much concern for the greater whole. This is why such great importance is placed on fitting in and being a team player. Conversely, it also means that few participants in society really have or attempt any understanding of larger issues like climate change, geopolitics, and population issues, or why, despite our advances in technology, we still work as hard as our grandparents did.</p>
    
    <p> Such problems are typically left to "them," but do "they," the experts, really know what they're doing?
Specialization Our educational system and our business leaders all advise us to "become a specialist." The reason is that while generalized skills are very beneficial, they don't fit well into the existing system. The existing system requires specialists--cogs that fit into a system that has already been built.
Specialist knowledge is much cheaper to acquire for mass production purposes than is generalized knowledge.</p>
    
    <p> Imagine all the skills one would need to acquire to build a car from raw minerals that were dug out of the ground. It would take a lifetime to acquire sufficient skills to make a single car, after which one would be too old to make more. If, instead, several people learn just one simple skill and are organized into an assembly line,
the reduced time spent on learning allows them to produce much more.
Given the limitations of human intelligence and lifespan, specialization is the only way to rapidly produce sophisticated products.</p>
    
    <p>
In that sense, the complex skills of building a car have been transferred from the master craftsman up to the factory system, which has gotten very complex, with computer-controlled assembly lines and inventory management. Conversely, the system tries to divide labor into as narrow specializations as possible to cut costs. Using again the example of manufacturing a car, specialization can be narrowed to the point of replacing people with robots that weld a single piece of metal.
The cost of specialization It's obviously more expensive, both in time and money, for Person A and Person B to gain the required amount of knowledge in both fields X and Y than it is if A were to concentrate on X while B concentrated on Y.</p>
    
    <p> In this way, both can gain the same depth of knowledge in half of the fields, in half the time. Alternatively, they can get twice as much knowledge in the same field in the same time. It follows that the more a field is further split up into subfields, the less expensive this knowledge gets. These cost savings can be used to reach even deeper levels of competence (see this figure).</p>
