    <p> Bartering and swapping can also be used to get rid of unwanted things (see How to get rid of things).
Using these methods, I have not paid for a CD or a DVD in years.
Renting Generally, renting is an overused method when it doesn't benefit the consumer, and an underused method when it would benefit the consumer.
Consequently, if you're used to buying something, you should look into how and where to rent.</p>
    
    <p> Conversely, if you're used to renting, calculate whether it's worthwhile. When renting long-term, consider the cap rate (see Rent or own?), which holds for small items as well as houses. When renting, you're usually not responsible for breakdowns. This is a winning proposition if you don't have the skills to fix it yourself and a losing one if you do have the skills or could cultivate them.</p>
    
    <p> Also important is how often you use a thing. Maybe a 24 foot ladder is only used once a year, in which case it could be rented from a home improvement store. If you do a lot of printing,
it makes sense to own your own printer, but it actually takes a lot of $0.50 printouts at the local copy center before the price of a new printer is reached.</p>
    
    <p> Also, consider that instead of renting very expensive and rarely used special tools, you could simply hire a professional and his tools to do that part of the job.
Borrowing Borrowing is another method. The cardinal rule of borrowing is always to return the borrowed item in the same or better condition. There should be no exceptions to this rule.</p>
    
    <p> Returning something slightly damaged or dirty is almost guaranteed to cut you out of the loop the next time you want to borrow something. Lending your things out can also be a way of having access to them without having to store them. Now, you may think that giving your books to the library will allow you to borrow them back and not have to store them constantly; however, libraries will most likely sell your books instead to cover their operating costs.
Sharing ownership Many offices have a coffee club where money is contributed to buying a shared coffee machine and coffee suppliess.</p>
    
    <p> This saves everybody the expense of each buying their own individual coffee machine. It takes initiative to establish such clubs, so don't wait for someone else to do it. If you have an idea, propose it; people just might say yes. Here are some examples of things that can be purchased and shared: tools, sports equipment, A/V equipment, computer equipment, vehicles, boats,
appliances, etc.</p>
    
    <p> It seems to be a fact of life that very few people will take the initiative to establish something new, but many will gladly go along once someone proposes it. Here are some examples of people to start a club with: friends, family, co-workers, team members, etc. Such clubs can also be established with things everybody already owns. I have heard of households rotating kitchen appliances using the theory that ice cream makers, waffle irons, grills, and similar rarely used appliances might not see daily use.</p>
    
    <p> That way everybody gets a chance to try them out. I find that these arrangements work best when everybody trusts one another.
Living behind the cutting edge In computing, actually high-tech in general, there are a number of consumers who effectively "pay" to be beta testers of companies' products in exchange for having the latest and greatest. Leave it to other consumers to work out the technological kinks and take the depreciation hit for "driving it off the lot.</p>
