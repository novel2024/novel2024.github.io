    <p> In a sense, it was not the “same game” at all; play against a human partner produced a distinctively different pattern of brain activity. A larger number of brain regions were activated, and these regions manifested a higher degree of connectivity with one another. Playing against another human produced a richer experience, neurologically speaking, than playing against a computer. Other studies have found that areas of the brain involved in planning and anticipation, and in feeling empathy, are more active when we are playing against a human as compared to a computer.</p>
    
    <p> Brain regions associated with reward also show stronger stimulation when we play—and especially when we win—against a human opponent.
The tools employed in such research are so unobtrusive they can even be used with babies and toddlers, allowing scientists to explore how social interaction shapes the thinking of children as they grow and develop. EEG is a technology that tracks and records brain wave patterns via a cap of electrodes placed on a subject’s scalp; it was applied in a study conducted by Patricia Kuhl, a psychologist at the University of Washington. Kuhl and her collaborators observed nine-month-old infants from English-speaking homes as they interacted with a Spanish-speaking tutor, counting how many times the babies shifted their gaze between the tutor and the toys the tutor pointed to while speaking the names of the toys in Spanish.</p>
    
    <p> Such eye movements, Kuhl explains,
provide an indication of the degree to which the children were bringing their social capacities to bear on their learning of a new language.
After twelve of these tutoring sessions, the researchers obtained a neural measure of the babies’ second-language learning, using EEG to gauge how strongly their brains reacted to hearing Spanish spoken aloud. The infants who had engaged in the most social interaction—frequently looking back and forth between the tutor and the toys the tutor was talking about—also showed the most evidence of having learned Spanish, as indicated by their brain activity in response to Spanish sounds. Such neuroscientific findings join a larger body of evidence generated by psychology and cognitive science, all pointing to a striking conclusion: we think best when we think socially.</p>
    
    <p>
Yet even as scientific evidence of the link between social interaction and intelligent thought accumulates, our society remains mired in a brainbound approach to cognition; our activities at school and at work still treat thinking as the manipulation of abstract symbols inside individual heads. We are asked to produce facts (on tests, in reports) without the presence of a person to edify. We make arguments (write essays, author memos) without the presence of a person to debate. We are asked to set information out (log entries in a knowledge to debate.</p>
    
    <p> We are asked to set information out (log entries in a knowledge management system), or take information in (read manuals and instructions),
without the presence of a person with whom to trade stories.
We are, that is, continually expected to think about abstract symbols for the benefit of an abstract audience, an expectation that overlooks our actual strength.
Humans are not especially good at thinking about concepts; our ability to think about people, however, is superlative. Consider the Wason Selection Task, a test of reasoning widely used in experimental psychology.</p>
    
    <p> Introduced by psychologist Peter Wason in 1966, the task seems straightforward enough. One version of it goes something like this: “Take a look at the cards shown here.
Each card has a vowel or a consonant on one side and an even or an odd number on the other. Which card or cards must be turned over in order to determine whether it is true that If a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other?” Four cards are displayed; the first is marked with an “E,” the second with a “K,” the third with the number 3, and the fourth with the number 6.</p>
    
    <p>
People’s performance on this task is abysmal. Studies by many researchers over many years have shown that only about 10 percent of subjects given the task complete it correctly. Even when the language of the task is rephrased to pose a familiar-sounding problem—like which train a subway rider should take to get to her destination—people’s performance remains strikingly poor. Change one particular aspect of the task, however, and the percentage of participants getting it right shoots up to 75 percent.</p>
    
    <p> What is that change? Make it social.
In the social version of the task, participants are told: “You are serving at a bar and have to enforce the rule that if a person is drinking beer, they must be 21 years of age or older. The four cards shown here have information about people sitting at a table. One side of the card tells you what a person is drinking, and the other side tells their age.</p>
