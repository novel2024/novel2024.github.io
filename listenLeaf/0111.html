A second principle for engendering groupiness would go like this: people who need to think together should train together—in person, at the same time.
Research shows that teams that trained as a group collaborate more effectively,
commit fewer errors, and perform at a higher level than teams made up of people who were trained separately. Training together can also reduce the “silo effect,” a common phenomenon in which co-workers fail to communicate or collaborate across different departments and disciplines. Yet training together is not the norm in many industries.</p>
    
    <p> In medicine, for example, health care providers representing various specialties—surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists,
pharmacists—must collaborate closely when caring for patients. But traditionally, their training occurs in isolation from one another, in different departments and even different institutions.
Some medical schools and hospitals are now experimenting with group training across disciplinary lines. The University of Minnesota has found an especially engaging way to do so: creating an “escape room.</p>
    
    <p>” In this activity (modeled on an adventure game), UMN students studying nursing, pharmacy,
physical therapy, and social work, among other disciplines, are invited into a simulated hospital room. There they are given the case study of a fictional patient—for example: “A 55-year-old male with a past medical history of bipolar disorder and type I diabetes presents to the emergency room with diabetic ketoacidosis, triggered by a recent manic episode.” Acting under the pressure of a one-hour time limit, the students must work together to develop a discharge plan for the patient by solving a series of puzzles, making use of the objects and information available in the room—and drawing on the participants’ varied areas of expertise. The game is followed by a guided debriefing session in which students reflect on the challenges of collaborating across fields.</p>
    
    <p> The “interprofessional escape room” is now part of the formal curriculum for students studying the health sciences at the University of Minnesota; similar activities have been introduced at hospitals and medical schools located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Buffalo, New York; Tucson, Arizona; and Lubbock,
Texas.
A third principle for generating groupiness would hold that people who need to think together should feel together—in person, at the same time. Laboratory research, as well as research conducted with survivors of battlefield conflicts and natural disasters, has found that emotionally distressing or physically painful events can act as a kind of “social glue” that bonds the people who experienced them together. But the emotions that unite a group need not be so harrowing.</p>
    
    <p>
Studies have also determined that simply asking members to candidly share their thoughts and feelings with one another leads to improvements in group cohesion and performance.
The Energy Project, a training and consulting firm based in New York, holds a companywide “community meeting” every Wednesday. Each of the organization’s employees is asked a series of simple questions, starting with “How are you feeling?” “That’s a very different question than the standard ‘How are you?’ we all ask each other every day,” notes Tony Schwartz, the company’s founder and CEO. “When people stop and reflect, and then say, one at a time,
how each of them are really feeling, it opens up a deeper level of dialogue.</p>
    
    <p>” At times, he recounts, his colleagues’ answers have been searching or even wrenching, reflecting a personal crisis or family tragedy. But even when responses are more run-of-the-mill, the members of his close-knit staff have shared an emotional experience with one another, one that is fleshed out by the remaining questions in the series: “What’s the most important thing you learned last week?” “What’s your goal for this week?” “What are you feeling most grateful for?” The fourth and final mandate for eliciting groupiness is this: people who need to think together should engage in rituals together—in person, at the same time.
For this purpose, a ritual can be any meaningful organized activity in which members of a group take part together. If the rituals involve synchronized movement or shared physiological arousal, all the better.</p>
    
    <p> Both of these switches are flipped at Clearview Elementary School in Sherburne County, Minnesota,
where each weekday starts with the “Morning Mile.” Students in every grade spend twenty minutes walking briskly before class, usually outside. The physical exertion involved means that shared physiological arousal is a given; teachers report that students arrive at their desks with cheeks flushed (especially during the cold Minnesota winters). But the Morning Mile generates synchronous movement as well.</p>
    
    <p> Research shows that when people walk or run together, they automatically and unconsciously match up their bodily movements.
Even so ordinary a ritual as sharing a meal can make a difference in how well a group thinks together. Lakshmi Balachandra, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College in Massachusetts, asked 132 MBA students to role-play executives negotiating a complex joint venture agreement between two companies. In the simulation she arranged, the greatest possible profits would be created by parties who were able to discern the other side’s preferences and then work collectively to maximize profits for the venture as a whole, rather than merely considering their own company’s interests.</p>
