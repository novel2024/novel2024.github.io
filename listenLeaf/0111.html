Now determine how many outfits you need; in our society six is typically sufficient--one for each day of the work week and one for the weekend, although if you can convince your colleagues that you still wash your clothes, you can go with fewer. If following fashion is important to you, consider that the average piece of clothing lasts about 100 wash cycles.
Better clothes may last 200 cycles. If washing is the primary source of failure, the amount of clothes should be balanced to wear out by the time it becomes unfashionable.</p>
    
    <p> This amount is determined by Lanchester's Square Law. For example, 10 average shirts that get washed after wearing them for a day give 1,000 washes total. They would last a little under 3 years given equal amount of wear. If shirt fashion changes faster than this, 10 shirts is too many.</p>
    
    <p> As clothes can take up a lot of space, you may want to reduce the size of your wardrobe to keep other things in your closet, or to simply require less closet space in the first place.
Making your own clothing Clothing is now so inexpensive, at least in terms of getting dressed, that making your own isn't worthwhile other than for the satisfaction it brings.
Mending and darning are still valuable skills, as is resizing.
Laundry You may want to put in an external constraint that all dirty clothes should comprise a full laundry load to minimize laundry machine use (wear,
money, water, electricity).</p>
    
    <p> If you use machines, figure full loads. This will likely be two loads, a colder one and a warmer one. If you're two people doing laundry together, the loads will be done twice as often, which makes it possible to get away with only owning half as many clothes. Three people means one-third and so on.</p>
    
    <p> If you handwash, you can get away with one to three sets of clothes, depending on your drying times. Many synthetic fabrics, such as "no-wrinkle," require little maintenance and dry quickly. In this case, it's possible to make do with only one set of clothing which dries overnight while one sleeps-- this is the holy grail of wardrobe minimalism.
To wash a full load of clothes "by hand," put it in a sealed bucket with some water and detergent and drive it down a bumpy road.</p>
    
    <p> Don't forget the rinse cycle. This is done by transferring the clothes to a clean bucket on the way back. If you don't have a bumpy road available, you can use a plastic container (10gal.) and a plunger.</p>
    
    <p> If you don't have a plunger, attach a shovel handle to a wooden stool and twist it around. Alternatively, you can buy electric contraptions that will agitate the clothes for you. These are called washing machines and cost a few hundred bucks. They usually need to be repaired every few years.</p>
    
    <p>
Commercial detergent is an interesting concoction of sodium carbonate,
borax, and inactive ingredients (color agents), all of which are very inexpensive, plus advertising campaigns, management salaries, distribution systems, etc., which comprise most of the cost. To make your own, you only need sodium carbonate, which is sold as either washing soda (check out the art supply section) or pH booster (next to the pool supplies), borax (laundry detergent section), and grated bar soap (grate your own). Mix these in a 1:1:1 ratio.</p>
