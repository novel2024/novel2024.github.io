    <p> A person living in the present would very much like to cut down that forest as soon as possible and turn it into paper. A future-oriented person would carefully try to preserve his principal asset, the forest, and only cut when necessary, living off the trimmings. He would think of his wealth as the amount of wood he can get by trimming, not the amount of wood he could get if he cut the forest down. Unfortunately, so many people see it differently.</p>
    
    <p> That is why they keep working to both cut down existing trees, as well as planting seeds and cutting down the saplings as soon as they get the chance. They don't see the freedom that the mature forest offers. The entire focus is on maximum wood production in the present rather than minimum effort in the future.
This frame of mind is pervasive.</p>
    
    <p> Retirement is seen as spending hoarded savings, and survivalists tend to focus on stocking up on tools and supplies. Rather than forming an environment which can sustain them, they accumulate assets to survive in an environment that isn't conducive to their living. Conversely, a hunter-gatherer lives in an environment conducive to living. The traditional hunter-gatherer works 15 hours a week to gather resources from his environment.</p>
    
    <p> With our level of technology and understanding, we can gather resources from our environment more effectively and only work a few hours a week, or part of the year, or develop enough assets to no longer work at all, letting others do the work.104 Personal economics Personal economics is the study of the principles of how individuals can most efficiently acquire resources, create and derive utility, and decompose or dispose of the resulting waste in a way that turns it back into resources.
Ideally, society would be set up in a sustainable fashion, so that the material cycle runs in a stable, nongrowing fashion with no losses. In such a system,
waste wouldn't be a problem, since it would serve as resources for the next cycle.</p>
    
    <p> For example, leftover food would be composted and turned into fertilizer for the next harvest rather than ending up in landfills. Bags,
houses, and even computers could be disposed of in a similar fashion,
serving as raw materials for the next evolution.
Currently, this is far from the case. Modern living mostly involves producing products, consuming them, and throwing them out, with money driving the cycle.</p>
    
    <p> Now, it's possible to completely avoid dealing with this part of the economy and never set foot in a shopping center or pay for anything with money. However, although interesting, such self-imposed constraints aren't optimally efficient. As bad as the normal consumer economy is, it has its good points, so some interaction is desired or even necessary. The more interaction with the local economy by systems thinking people--and the reader should be one by this point--the better the likelihood of societal change.</p>
    
    <p> This interaction requires money, and so it requires some means of acquiring money. This can be done in two ways:
"You working for money" or "Money working for you." In a money economy, the flow of money is a bit more complicated than this.
Financial cash flow cycles This section describes the different ways money flows for different people operating within a free market economy.</p>
    
    <p> This figure shows the simplest possible financial cycle for a salaried person. Here you work which results in a wage which you spend on stuff which you consume. Here stuff represents actual stuff, as well as services like dental work, car insurance,
and so on. This is the work-spend-consume cycle described in The lock-in and The salary man.</p>
