    <p> Do not seek external validation to the point where you make yourself a sitting duck for validation. It is okay for people to like you, and it is also okay if they do not like you. Liking yourself is good enough. When you have put on the armor of self-love and acceptance, you make it a little bit harder for predators to creep through your defenses.</p>
    
    <p> This is not to mean that any person who has been manipulated does not love themselves enough. However, in romantic relationships, you can really protect yourself if you have already internally validated yourself before going out there to the wolves.
You have isolated yourself from family or friends You’ve probably heard this story before--an elderly person who lives alone meets a charming young man on the Internet. This online acquaintance quickly becomes a romantic interest.</p>
    
    <p> A few months down the line, the young man is saying all the right things and getting money wired into their bank account every month. A year down the line, the elderly woman or man has exhausted all their retirement savings and reeling from the discovery that their online love interest was just a con. While the victim wallows in embarrassment and wiped out finances, you can only wonder how the con managed to pull off a scam that is so simple and obvious that it is laughable.
How can a person be so gullible, you wonder? It really is simple.</p>
    
    <p> It is easier to fool one person than it is to fool many.
One person who obviously had some wisdom in him put it this way: You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time,
but you cannot fool all the people all the time. This is a fact that predators know--it is much easier to hunt the lone antelope as it wanders in the savannah, alone and unprotected against all the dangers of the world. When you are surrounded by loving friends and family, you have a wall around you that keeps the predators out.</p>
    
    <p> Even when you are certain that you are in love and your partner is the best thing that happened to you, there will be that one person in your circle whose critical thinking has not been impaired by the passion of a new relationship. That one person will be your buffer against manipulation. It is no surprise that many people who manipulate and abuse their partners try to keep them away from their family. These manipulators and abusers know that if another party comes into the mix,
their entire gig will be up.</p>
    
    <p>
You are highly emotional Emotions are great. The ability to experience happiness, joy, surprise, love,
sadness, and every emotion of the human experience is a gift. For some people, this gift was given in spades. If you are the kind of person who goes through life feeling things more than thinking things, you are highly vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
    
    <p> Manipulators are able to fake emotions while saying and doing everything you need to hear. They do not even have to make sense--they just need to verbalize the things that you long for, and you are sold. Now, if you are highly emotional, there is not a whole lot of things you can do to change yourself. You are born that way, and you can only learn how to cope with being so highly emotional.</p>
    
    <p> That being said, you can always make sure that you stay conscious of your emotions so that they are not always dictating your decisions for you.
You do not educate yourself You do not need to go back to school to learn all the ways that people are trying to take advantage of you. A good thing about living in today’s world is that information is freely available right at the fingertips. You only need to be willing to learn.</p>
