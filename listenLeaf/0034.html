    <p> The inputs are the assembly worker's time and energy, and some components from another assembly worker. These inputs are added together to form other components which are handed over to the next assembly worker.
While the assembly worker's job itself may be very involved and require many skills, the process is still linear. An outside observer can count on the fact that, given twice as much time and energy, the assembly worker can construct twice as many predictably identical components.</p>
    
    <p>
Contrast this with the nonlinear work of an entrepreneur, a scientist,19 or a football coach. In a nonlinear problem, the whole is different from the sum of the components. What makes the whole different is the structure connecting the parts. For the assembly line, the structure is the assembly line or conveyor belt itself.</p>
    
    <p> For a car, the structure is what makes the individual parts of a car. In football, the structure of the plays is sometimes more important than individual players.
Nonlinearity is inherently much harder to deal with than linearity. In fact, a tremendous amount of effort goes into linearizing problems to make them understandable and solvable.</p>
    
    <p> There are several methods.
The first method is to reduce the degrees of freedom by reducing the number of objects and the number of connections between the objects, thus making the problem easier to understand. This simplifies the problem, but it runs the risk of eliminating degrees of freedom that are essential to the problem. The solution to the simplified problem is not necessarily the solution to the original problem.</p>
    
    <p> Furthermore, the simpler problem does not show the richness of solutions of the original problem. This method of simplification is probably the greatest source of error and inaccuracy;
particularly because the answers to simple problems are generally precise-- but let's not mistake precision for accuracy.
The second method is to break big problems into smaller problems in a reductionist way. Each subproblem can then be tackled linearly -- if not, it is further broken down.</p>
    
    <p> Once the subproblems have been solved, the solution to the big problem is found by adding the sub-solutions together.
Unfortunately, this doesn't always produce the optimal solution. For instance, one can't bake a loaf of bread by first heating the flour for half an hour, then heating the milk or water for half an hour, then heating the yeast for half an hour, and then mixing them all together at the end. Baking requires complex interactions between the flour, the yeast and the liquid prior to baking for the optimal solution.</p>
    
    <p> It's not trivial to find this solution.
Unfortunately, we haven't found a mechanical method to find optimal,
clever--or as mathematicians would say, elegant--solutions to complex problems. Such solutions often rely on intuitive "insights." Intuition is a result of complex neural connections in the brain suddenly firing in a way that connects with a real problem.</p>
    
    <p> This requires two ingredients. The first ingredient is the network itself, which can be established by studying many other similar problems. The second ingredient is thinking about the problem at hand. Combining the experience of similar solutions with the current problem results in new and creative solutions, often accompanied by statements such as, "I was contemplating [something] when I suddenly was inspired by [something unrelated].</p>
