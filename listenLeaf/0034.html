    <p> Having watched many of his undergraduates struggle to understand these centrally important concepts, Joseph Chinnici, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University, had an idea: Why not ask students to “become” human chromosomes—to understand cell division and reproduction from the inside, as it were, by acting out these processes with their own bodies?
After fine-tuning his approach over several years, Chinnici published an account of his method in the journal The American Biology Teacher. He begins by distributing baseball caps and t-shirts, each of which has been marked with a letter representing a gene: uppercase letters for dominant genes, lowercase letters denoting recessive genes. Once they have donned these items of clothing,
students are guided through a kind of carefully choreographed waltz. In prophase, some of the “human chromosomes” pair up by linking arms.</p>
    
    <p> In metaphase, those chromosomes who have remained unpaired move to an area designated as the “spindle.” On to anaphase, during which the paired-up students split apart and move to opposite poles of the spindle. Finally, they act out telophase, in which the spindle dissolves and the chromosomes unwind. Amid some awkward laughter and some momentarily furrowed brows, students find their way through this odd dance—seeing, and feeling, for themselves how the many moving parts interact.</p>
    
    <p>
Chinnici’s study found that students who had engaged in role-playing mitosis and meiosis achieved a more accurate understanding of the concept—a result mirrored in other, similar studies. Researchers have examined the effects of having students embody the solar system’s planets as they engage in direct and retrograde motion; of having students embody carbon molecules as they undergo the enzymatic reactions of the Krebs cycle; and of having students embody amino acids undergoing polymerization as they are synthesized into proteins. In each of these scenarios, students learned more and performed better when they were offered the opportunity to embody these entities rather than simply reading or hearing about them.
“Being it”—embodying a conceptual object—is a very different experience from “watching it,” or viewing a conceptual object as “remote and separate from oneself,” notes Carmen Petrick Smith of the University of Vermont, who has studied the effects of physically embodying mathematical concepts.</p>
    
    <p> Groups of students might form a triangle with their outstretched arms, for example, and then experiment with moving closer to and farther away from one another; in this way they come to understand that the size of a triangle can vary without changing the degree of the angles at its corners. Smith notes that such “body- based activities” have been shown to deepen students’ understanding and strengthen their memory of mathematical concepts. Mathematics teachers have long incorporated manipulatives into their instruction—counting rods and cubes,
for example. The research of Smith and others suggests that students learn even more when the “manipulatives” they employ are their own bodies.</p>

 ONE FINAL CATEGORY of thought-enhancing movements encompasses those that enact an analogy, whether explicit or implicit. The language we use is full of metaphors that borrow from our experience as embodied creatures; metaphorical movements reverse-engineer this process, putting the body through the motions as a way of prodding the mind into the state the metaphor describes. “Moving the body can alter the mind by unconsciously putting ideas in our head before we are able to consciously contemplate them on our own,” as Sian Beilock has written. “Getting a person to move lowers his threshold for experiencing thoughts that share something in common with the movement.</p>
    
    <p>” To take one example: by moving our bodies, we activate a deeply ingrained and mostly unconscious metaphor connecting dynamic motion with dynamic thinking. Call to mind the words we use when we can’t seem to muster an original idea—we’re “stuck,” “in a rut”—and those we reach for when we feel visited by the muse. Then we’re “on a roll,” our thoughts are “flowing.” Research has demonstrated that people can be placed in a creative state of mind by physically acting out creativity-related figures of speech—like “thinking outside the box.</p>
    
    <p>” Psychologist Evan Polman of the University of Wisconsin– Madison designed an experiment in which participants were asked to complete a creative thinking task. Some students carried out the assignment while sitting inside a five-foot-square cardboard box; others completed the task while sitting next to the box. The participants who did their thinking literally “outside the box” came up with a list of creative solutions that was, on average, 20 percent longer than the list produced by those who brainstormed inside the box.
Polman and his colleagues also tested the generative effect of enacting another metaphor: the use of the phrase “on one hand .</p>
    
    <p> . . on the other hand” to convey the consideration of multiple possibilities. This time, participants were asked to come up with novel uses for a new campus building complex; half of them were asked to hold one hand outstretched as they engaged in brainstorming, while the others were instructed to alternate holding out one hand and then the other.</p>
