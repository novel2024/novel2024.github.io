    <p> The beneficial mental effects of moderately intense activity have been shown to last for as long as two hours after exercise ends.
The encouraging implication of this research is that we have it within our power to induce in ourselves a state that is ideal for learning, creating, and engaging in other kinds of complex cognition: by exercising briskly just before we do so. As things stand, however, we don’t often take intentional advantage of this opportunity. Our culture conditions us to see mind and body as separate— and so we separate, in turn, our periods of thinking from our bouts of exercise.</p>
    
    <p>
Consider how many of us make our visits to the gym only after work, for example, or on weekends. Instead, we should be figuring out how to incorporate bursts of physical activity into the work day and the school day—which means rethinking how we approach our breaks. Lunch breaks, coffee breaks, downtime between tasks or meetings: all become occasions to use exercise to maneuver our brains into an optimally functioning state.
For children, this is precisely the role played by recess; research shows that kids return from a session on the playground better able to focus their attention and to engage their executive function faculties.</p>
    
    <p> Yet at schools all over the country, recess has been reduced or even eliminated in order to generate more “seat time” spent on academic learning. The notion that time away from concentrated mental work is effectively time wasted is one of several wrongheaded notions we hold regarding breaks—wrongheaded, in this case,
because the ability to attend to such work declines steadily over time, and is actually refreshed by a bout of bodily exertion. Parents, teachers, and administrators who want students to achieve academically should be advocating for an increase in physically active recess time.
Another misguided idea about breaks: they should be used to rest the body, so as to fortify us for the next round of mental labor.</p>
    
    <p> As we’ve seen, it’s through exerting the body that our brains become ready for the kind of knowledge work so many of us do today. The best preparation for such (metaphorical) acts as wrestling with ideas or running through possibilities is to work up an (actual) sweat. Instead of languidly sipping a latte before tackling a difficult project, we should be taking an energetic walk around the block.
There’s one more erroneous assumption about breaks to address: we imagine that we’re replenishing the brain’s depleted resources when we spend our breaks doing something that feels different from work—scrolling through Twitter,
checking the news, looking at Facebook.</p>
    
    <p> The problem is that such activities engage the same brain regions and draw down the same mental capital we use to do our cognition-centric jobs. We resume our duties just as frazzled as before the pause, and maybe more so. Turning coffee breaks into what some public health experts call “movement breaks” allows us to return to our work a bit smarter than when we left it.
On his walks along the coastal California hills, Daniel Kahneman noticed that moving very fast “brings about a sharp deterioration in my ability to think coherently.</p>
    
    <p>” This observation, too, is supported by research: scientists draw what they call an “inverted U-shaped curve” to describe the relationship between exercise intensity and cognitive function, with the greatest benefits for thinking detected in the moderate-intensity middle part of the hump. On the right downward slope of the curve, where high-intensity activity is charted, control over cognition does indeed start to slacken—but this is not always a bad thing.
Very intense exercise, extended over a relatively long period, can induce a kind of altered state conducive to creative thought.
Such is the experience of Haruki Murakami, the celebrated Japanese novelist.</p>
    
    <p>
Murakami is a committed runner, a veteran of more than two dozen marathons who logs as many as fifty miles a week. He has even authored a book about it,
titled What I Talk About When I Talk About Running. “I’m often asked what I think about as I run,” Murakami writes. “Usually the people who ask this have never run long distances themselves.</p>
    
    <p> I always ponder the question. What exactly do I think about when I’m running?” Not much, he concludes. That’s kind of the point. “As I run, I don’t think much of anything worth mentioning.</p>
    
    <p> I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void.” Scientists have a term for the “void” Murakami describes: “transient hypofrontality.</p>
    
    <p>” Hypo means low or diminished, and frontality refers to the frontal region of the brain—the part that plans, analyzes, and critiques, and that usually maintains firm control over our thoughts and behavior. When all of our resources are devoted to managing the demands of intense physical activity,
however, the influence of the prefrontal cortex is temporarily reduced. In this loose hypofrontal mode, ideas and impressions mingle more freely; unusual and unexpected thoughts arise. Scientists speculate that the phenomenon of transient hypofrontality may underlie all kinds of altered states, from dreaming to drug trips—but intense exercise may be the most reliable way to induce it.</p>
