    <p>A second theme to emerge from a review of research on the extended mind isits distinctive take on the nature of expertise. Traditional notions of what makesan expert are highly brainbound, focused on internal, individual effort (think ofthe late psychologist Anders Ericsson’s famous finding that mastery in any fieldrequires “10,000 hours” of practice). The literature on the extended mindsuggests a different view: experts are those who have learned how best tomarshal and apply extra-neural resources to the task before them. Thisalternative perspective has real implications for how we understand and cultivatesuperior performance.</p>
    
    <p> For example: although the conventional take on expertisehighlights economy, efficiency, and optimality of action—geniuses andsuperstars “just do it”—research in the vein of the extended mind finds thatexperts actually do more experimenting, more testing, and more backtrackingthan beginners. They are more apt than novices to make skillful use of theirbodies, of physical space, and of relationships with others. In most scenarios,researchers have found, experts are less likely to “use their heads” and moreinclined to extend their minds—a habit that the rest of us can learn to emulate onour way to achieving mastery.Finally, in surveying the study of the extended mind, there’s one more themethat is impossible to ignore: the matter of what we might call “extensioninequality.</p>
    
    <p>” Our schools, our workplaces, the very structure of our society arebased on the assumption that some people are able to think more intelligentlythan others. The reason for such individual differences is taken as self-evident:obviously it’s because those people are smarter—because they have more of thestuff called “intelligence” inside their heads. Research on the extended mindpoints to a different explanation. That is: some people are able to think moreintelligently because they are better able to extend their minds.</p>
    
    <p> They may havemore knowledge about how mental extension works, the kind of knowledge thatthis book aims to make accessible. But it’s also indisputable that the extensionsthat allow us to think well—the freedom to move one’s body, say, or theproximity of natural green spaces; control over one’s personal workspace, orrelationships with informed experts and accomplished peers—are far fromequally distributed. When reading the chapters that follow, we should keep inmind the way access, or lack of access, to mental extensions might be shapingthe thinking of our students, employees, co-workers, and fellow citizens.Metaphors are powerful, and none more so than the ones we use to understandour own minds.</p>
    
    <p> The value of the approach described in these pages ultimatelylies in the novel analogy it offers, an analogy we can apply to our everydayefforts to learn and remember, to solve problems and imagine possibilities. Weextend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine or bulkingthem up like a muscle—but by strewing our world with rich materials, and byweaving them into our thoughts.PART ITHINKING WITH OUR BODIES1Thinking with SensationsDURING HIS YEARS of working as a financial trader at Goldman Sachs, MerrillLynch, and Deutsche Bank, John Coates watched it happen again and again.“Using my best analytical efforts, drawing on my education”—Coates has a PhDin economics from the University of Cambridge—“and a wide reading ofeconomic reports and statistics,” he would devise a brilliant trade, one that wasimpeccable in its logic and unassailable in its reasoning.</p>
    
    <p> And—it would losemoney, every time.Then there were other occasions, equally puzzling. “I would catch a glimpsewith peripheral vision of another possibility, another path into the future. Itshowed up as a mere blip in my consciousness, a momentary tug on myattention, but it was a flash of insight coupled with a gut feeling that gave it theimprimatur of the highly probable.</p>
    
    <p>” When he obeyed these “gut feelings,”Coates found, he was usually rewarded with a profitable outcome. Against all hisassumptions, all his training, Coates was forced to arrive at an unconventionalconclusion: “Good judgment may require the ability to listen carefully tofeedback from the body.”Further, he observes, “some people may be better at this than others.” On anyWall Street trading floor “you will find high-IQ, Ivy League–educated stars whocannot make any money at all, for all their convincing analyses; while across theaisle sits a trader with an undistinguished degree from an unknown university,who cannot keep up with the latest analytics, but who consistently prints money,to the bafflement and irritation of his seemingly more gifted colleagues.</p>
    
    <p>” It ispossible, muses Coates, “though odd to contemplate, that the better judgment ofthe money-making trader may owe something to his or her ability to producebodily signals, and equally to listen to them.”Coates shares these reflections in a captivating book, The Hour Between Dogand Wolf, which draws on his years as a trader as well as on his surprisingsecond career as an applied physiologist. Over time, the questions generated byhis work in finance—“Could we tell whether one person has better gut feelingsthan another? Could we monitor feedback from their bodies?”—became morecompelling than the work itself, and Coates left Wall Street to pursue theanswers in scientific research. He presented the fruits of his inquiry in 2016,detailing the results of a collaboration with academic neuroscientists andpsychiatrists in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
    
    <p>Coates and his new colleagues examined a group of financial traders workingon a London trading floor, asking each one to identify the successive momentswhen he felt his heart beat—a measure of the individual’s sensitivity to bodilysignals. The traders, they found, were much better at this task than were an age-and gender-matched group of controls who did not work in finance. What’smore, among the traders themselves, those who were the most accurate indetecting the timing of their heartbeats made more money, and tended to havelonger tenures in what was a notably volatile line of work. “Our results suggestthat signals from the body—the gut feelings of financial lore—contribute tosuccess in the markets,” the team concluded.</p>
    
    <p> Confirming Coates’s informalobservations, those who thrived in this milieu were not necessarily people withgreater education or intellect, but rather “people with greater sensitivity tointeroceptive signals.”Interoception is, simply stated, an awareness of the inner state of the body.Just as we have sensors that take in information from the outside world (retinas,cochleas, taste buds, olfactory bulbs), we have sensors inside our bodies thatsend our brains a constant flow of data from within. These sensations aregenerated in places all over the body—in our internal organs, in our muscles,even in our bones—and then travel via multiple pathways to a structure in thebrain called the insula.</p>
