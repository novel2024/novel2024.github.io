    <p>." Even once you're living the good life, they will still not understand, because according to the shadows, what you're doing doesn't make sense: "But you don't have a lawn!" However, you might be surprised to see that eventually the people around you, your previously doubting friends and family, will start to adopt some of your behavioral patterns. While they will not take the lead, they will follow your example. What Gandhi said; "Be the change you want to see," may sound trite, but that doesn't make it untrue.</p>
    
    <p> It works far better than trying to institute policies! You don't need to wait for change while gathering forces; just change. If enough people do it, it will start a slow revolution from the bottom up. When people have more time as a result of working less, because they need less money to satisfy their wants, more things will get done, because it's the right thing to do--the world will be slightly better for it. For those who choose to do it, attaining financial independence in a handful of years will provide them the time and freedom,
the lack of which has previously prevented them from getting things done and caused relations with friends to stagnate or degenerate into acquaintances or "networking opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>" Financial independence and extreme early retirement are still for the explorers and the pioneers of a new lifestyle. They will be followed by others. Now there are few to follow, but I predict that within a decade or so there will be many others--more on this later.
Is this for me?
The methods presented in this book don't rely on a combination of risky techniques coupled with once-in-a-lifetime opportunities such as bull market investment returns or leveraged or correctly timed real estate speculation, all of which are hard to replicate.</p>
    
    <p> While such methods are interesting to read about, they fall into the high-risk/high-return, personal anecdote category, where only a few people win. Also, typically, when books describing such opportunities finally come out, it's too late to implement their methods, as the market has already peaked.
In this book (and in my life) I have chosen to rely on methods that work regardless of external circumstances, as long as your country has a market economy and does not force anyone to work. However, as mentioned above, just because the methods are universally applicable, it doesn't mean that everybody will adopt them and follow through.</p>
    
    <p> This book is, after all,
about leaving Plato's Cave and prescribes a lifestyle makeover rather than simple, quick fixes to patch the problems of other lifestyles. To use a sports analogy, this book will teach you how to think and work out like an athlete so that you can become an athlete, rather than present a few easy workouts to lose a few pounds and "get into shape" before the beach season begins.
It might be helpful for readers to get an idea of whether they're ready to leave the cave. What follows are a few questions which might indicate whether someone is a good fit for the proposed changes.</p>
    
    <p>
Are you completely happy with your life?
This question is important for anyone contemplating change. Anyone who thinks their life perfect is unlikely to want to change anything.
However, perhaps you're not completely satisfied with your life, or maybe the way the world works doesn't quite make sense to you. For instance, why do we still work eight hours a day, 50 weeks a year,
when we're twice as productive as we were 50 years ago? Why do we have children, then send them away for most of the day shortly after they're born? Is there more to life than more work and more stuff? Can happiness be bought?
Do you want to live on a solid foundation?
Many people get married, start a family, or buy a home without a solid financial foundation based on savings.</p>
    
    <p> Instead they borrow heavily hoping to make up the difference later. This can easily turn into a lifetime of struggling to make ends meet because such a large fraction of the income goes towards paying interest on past consumption when it instead could be used to live better. For example, people could work less and spend more time with each other. A good financial foundation allows parents to raise their own children instead of outsourcing the job to daycare centers and babysitters.</p>
    
    <p> A good financial foundation allows people to spend more time working on things they want to work on instead of working on things they have to work on to pay the bills.
In general, financial independence creates much more flexibility and allows a greater choice of how one lives.
Do you want to start a business?
Being financially independent you can take risks with your time to focus on projects which don't require an immediate payout to justify your effort. If successful, working for yourself can be more remunerative than working for others, because you receive the full benefit of your efforts.</p>
