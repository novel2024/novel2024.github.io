Deception is the narcissist’s way of throwing you off reality so that they remain in control. In any case, they also live in an altered reality where they are perfect, and everyone else is their inferior. Deception is, therefore, also a way for them to loop you into this unending narrative where they are the main character.
Unpacking the Dark Triad: Machiavellianism Niccolo Machiavelli, often referred to as the father of modern political science, was an Italian of the Renaissance period who wore many hats.</p>
    
    <p>
Machiavelli was a politician, historian, humanist, poet, author, and diplomat, among others. In 1513, Machiavelli wrote his most famous book,
The Prince. In this book, Machiavelli described and endorsed the use of unscrupulous means to gain and maintain political power. From this work and his endorsements arose the term Machiavellianism, which was used to refer to the type of political leaders and tactics that Machiavelli described in his book.</p>
    
    <p> This term was later borrowed by psychology experts to describe a personality trait that is characterized by lack of emotion and a desire to achieve at the expense of others be it through deceit, manipulation or flouting of common rules of decency and morality. In the simplest terms, a person who exhibits Machiavellianism is willing to do just about anything it if means winning. Machiavelli is the reason why the phrase the end justifies the means exists.
Since the adoption of the term Machiavellianism in psychology, much research has been undertaken to determine exactly what drives the individuals who score highly on the Machiavellianism test, otherwise known as high Machs.</p>
    
    <p> It has been found that high Machs tend to value power, money, and competition above everything else. High Machs place very low premium on things like community building, family, and even love. The reverse is true for those who score low on the Machiavellianism scale, otherwise known as low Machs.
Characteristics of High Machs High Machs are all around us.</p>
    
    <p> You probably know one or even work for one in your current workplace. High Machs are driven and often successful.
They have worked hard and smart to be where they are, often stepping on others’ toes unapologetically. If you know someone who is highly successful and seems to be feared by everyone around them, then you are likely dealing with a high Mach.</p>
    
    <p> So, what exactly distinguishes a person that scores highly on the Machiavellianism scale?
High Machs hate structure Structure comes with rules, and high Machs hate rules. Ergo, high Machs hate structure as well. High Machs would rather be left alone to make their own rules as they go by. They abhor having to do something simply because someone else said so.</p>
    
    <p> Rules do not make sense to them, and the structure is imprisoning. High Machs, therefore, thrive in environments where they are boundless and free to be as creative as they want. As far as professions go, high Machs tend to prefer business environments while shunning any profession that involves helping other people. High Machs,
for instance, makes very effective salesman by a count of the fact that they are willing to tell lies to sell a product if it earns them a commission.</p>
    
    <p> An individual who scores lowly on the Machiavellianism scale might feel guilty about selling hot air to a consumer. Not so for a high Mach. As long as the benefit of a fat bonus and commission is awaiting him, a high Mach will ensure that customer gives them their money in return for whatever they are selling. In other words, the end will always justify the means for a high Mach.</p>
