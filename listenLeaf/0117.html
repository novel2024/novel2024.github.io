    <p> When a group of people think together, however, their potentially divergent interests need somehow to be directed toward the accomplishment of a collective goal.
Incentives must thus be engineered such that, instead of pursuing their own ends,
group members are inspired by a sense of “shared fate”: the results achieved by one member are felt to benefit them all. Psychological research, and some still relevant history, show that such reengineering can be dramatically effective— even in the most volatile of situations.
 THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS in Austin, Texas, were in crisis.</p>
    
    <p> It was 1971, and the education system was undergoing court-ordered desegregation, bringing white students, African American students, and Latino students together in classrooms for the first time. The schools were roiling with conflict and even physical violence. Matthew Snapp, assistant superintendent of schools, turned for help to his former academic mentor, a social psychologist and University of Texas professor named Elliot Aronson.
“The first step was to find out what the hell was going on in those classrooms,” Aronson recalled.</p>
    
    <p> He and his graduate students sat in the back and watched, and what they saw was in many ways typical of middle school education, both then and now: “The teacher stands in front of the room, asks a question, and waits for the students to indicate that they know the answer,” Aronson recounted. “Most frequently, six to ten youngsters strain in their seats and raise their hands—some waving them vigorously in an attempt to attract the teacher’s attention. Several other students sit quietly with their eyes averted, as if trying to make themselves invisible.” Through daily experience with such scenarios, he noted, “students learn more than the content of the material explicitly taught in the classroom.</p>
    
    <p> The medium is the message; they learn implicit lessons from the process as well.” And what they learned was that “there is no payoff for consulting with their peers”; rather,
the payoff lay solely in “giving the correct answer—the one which the teacher had in her head.” In the best of times, such single-minded pursuit of one’s own interests was incompatible with cooperation and collaboration; in the uneasy environment that then prevailed, it was exacerbating tensions and reinforcing stereotypes.
Aronson and his team sought to foster a more communal spirit among the students, but they knew that simply encouraging them to work together wasn’t the answer.</p>
    
    <p> Instead, they shifted the incentives to which students were responding—by creating, in Aronson’s words, “a situation where they needed to cooperate with one another in order to understand the material.” They called their procedure the “jigsaw classroom.” This is how it worked: Students were divided into groups of five or six. When a class began a new unit—say, on the life of Eleanor Roosevelt—each student in the group was assigned one section of the material: Roosevelt’s childhood and young adulthood, or her role as first lady, or her work on behalf of causes such as civil rights and world peace.</p>
    
    <p> The students’ task was to master their own section, then rejoin the group and report to the others on what they had learned.
“Each student has possession of a unique and vital part of the information,
which, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, must be put together before anyone can learn the whole picture,” Aronson explained. By arranging instruction in this manner, he was effectively creating a transactive memory system on the spot,
turning each student into an expert on a particular facet of the subject under study. “In this situation,” Aronson added, “the only way a child can be a good learner is to begin to be a good listener and interviewer”; the jigsaw structure “demands that the students utilize one another as resources.</p>
    
    <p>” The effects of the new approach were immediately apparent: the same students who had been straining to be recognized for their individual brilliance,
or endeavoring to retreat into a cloak of invisibility, were now focused on collaborating with one another. In studies carried out by Aronson and his graduate students that compared the jigsaw method to traditional modes of instruction, they identified longer-term effects as well. Students learned the material faster and performed better on exams when they participated in the jigsaw exercise; they also developed greater empathy and respect for their classmates. In the Austin-area schools where the jigsaw classroom was implemented, racial tensions diminished, absenteeism declined, and students reported more favorable attitudes toward school.</p>
    
    <p>
In an effort to collect as much objective evidence as possible, Elliot Aronson asked one of his graduate students to climb to the roofs of the schools in which they were working and take pictures of the playgrounds at recess. At the start,
these photographs showed a dispiriting reality: students were tightly clustered in groups defined by race, ethnicity, and gender. As the jigsaw experiment progressed, however, the pictures documented a striking shift, as these clenched formations began to loosen and disperse. Pupils were mingling and mixing more freely, their play reflecting their new experiences in the classroom.</p>
