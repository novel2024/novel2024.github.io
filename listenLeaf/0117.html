    <p>" This is a weight lifted or cleaned from the ground or near the ground to the shoulder, "half overhead," and then getting it "overhead" with the arms straight. Moving a weight from shoulder to waist height in a squat is a "quarter overhead." The distance covered for a deadlift is also considered a "quarter overhead." A push-up is roughly the distance of half an overhead, but since the feet are supporting half the bodyweight, each push-up is only half of that.</p>
    
    <p> If you weigh 200 pounds, one push up is thus 50 overhead pounds. You will find that, thus scaled, most compound movement work capacity tests lead to roughly the same numbers. The intensity of an "overhead" depends on the individual. Lifting a weight overhead requires more work for someone who is 6'2" than for someone who is 5'6.</p>
    
    <p>" Compared to human potential,88 a good measure of work capacity for a 6-foot 175-pound male is being able to execute 5,000 overhead pounds within 10 minutes89 (this will make you quite competitive for local sports events); 10,000+ overhead pounds is a professional performance, and 2,500 is rather weak.
Work capacity scales by bodyweight, so weighing 50% more means increasing expected capacity by 50%. Since male athletes are about 25% stronger than females athletes pound for pound, females can subtract 25%.
Unfortunately the current female body ideal in our culture is somewhat emaciated, and consequently women find themselves doing cardio to rid themselves of fat and muscle and working out with five-pound dumbbells to "tone" what's left of the muscles.</p>
    
    <p>90 This is strictly a cosmetic preference.
Functionally, if a 175-pound male is working out with 50 pound weights, a 125 pound female should be working out with 0.75×125/175 ×50 = 26 pound weights to be at the same level of fitness.
At this level, participating in physical activities won't be limited by general physical preparedness.</p>
    
    <p> Any limit will be sports-specific. For instance, your tendons and knees won't appreciate it if you decide to run a marathon tomorrow, but your heart, legs, and lungs will be up for the task.
Similarly, if you should decide to take up a sport like tennis, martial arts, or swimming, it will only be a lack of sports-specific technique that will hold you back. You should pass any fitness test by the military, police, fire department, etc.</p>
    
    <p> with flying colors.
Eating Why do we eat the way we do? Some eat for fuel, some eat for comfort,
but I bet most adopted the eating habits of their parents rather than making a deliberate choice. Before I discuss why I think food should be eaten for fuel with good taste as a side effect rather than the other way around, let me start by discussing eating for comfort and tradition.
A comfortable addiction Food is eaten for comfort when it's associated with good memories or even tradition, like the morning coffee, the Christmas turkey, or soup the way mom used to make it--even if it's now made in a factory.</p>
    
    <p> This kind of comfort food doesn't even need to taste particularly good to people outside one's particular culture, much like religious tenets often make little sense to people who follow a different faith.
However, food can also be directly addictive. For example, the amino acid tryptophan, which is found in abundance in chocolate, oats, and milk and meat products, is a precursor for the neurotransmitter serotonin, which improves mood. Normally tryptophan competes with other complex amino acids for entry into the brain, but an increase in blood sugar, which can be accomplished with sugar, white flour, and other "fast" carbohydrates,
decreases the blood level of all amino acids except tryptophan, leaving it without competition for entry at the blood-brain barrier.</p>
    
    <p> This is an excellent recipe for addiction. Chocolate chip oatmeal cookies anyone?
Here's another example. Milk protein is primarily composed of casein.
Casein breaks down to casomorphin, which is an opioid, so named because of its similarity to opium.</p>
