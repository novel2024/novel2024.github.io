    <p> However,
throughout and before history, warriors and pre-farmers--that is, hunter- gatherers--have followed a diet of eating almost nothing during the day followed by a large meal at night after the fight, or hunt, as it may be. This is called The Warrior Diet as developed by Ori Hofmekler and it prevents insulin levels from spiking more than once a day, and even better, instead of trying to plan and fit in three or six meals a day, it only requires the planning of a single meal. There is no tracking of calories as one develops a natural feel for being full without being bloated, and if prioritizing foods with a strong thermic effect by eating those first, it is hard to eat enough to gain weight with a single meal.
In terms of exertion, modern workers, like managers, assistants, and desk jockeys, and modern warriors like soldiers, policemen, and firefighters, have more in common with the historical warrior or hunter- gatherer than the farmer or the athlete.</p>
    
    <p> It would thus make sense to eat similarly. Imagine being called out to a fire just before one of the six small meals on the bodybuilder diet or just after one the three bigger meals on the farmer diet--exerting yourself on full stomach is not a pleasant experience!
Like switching to cold showers, changing the timing of one's meals takes a couple of weeks for the body to adapt to; especially if it's used to increasing insulin levels in anticipation of food at certain times of the day.
If food is not forthcoming, the presence of insulin will drop the blood sugar below a comfortable level and cause the sensation of hunger. Being hungry is nothing particularly worrisome unless it becomes a permanent condition;
unfortunately, well-fed people are unused to this feeling, and it's therefore a serious barrier to overcome.</p>
    
    <p> After a couple weeks of getting used to not eating at a particular time, the feeling will go away. If dinner is eaten at a regular time, one will still feel hungry if that meal is missed or delayed.
Eating every other day, even?
Freeing oneself from the timing of even the evening meal is very liberating. All meals can now be eaten at home.</p>
    
    <p> Even missing one meal,
that is, not eating for 48 hours, becomes possible. In fact, studies show that eating every other day, even when eating several meals that day, may increase longevity in the same way that constant caloric restriction does, at least in lab mice.92 Caloric restriction has been shown to extend longevity in two senses: not only does it mean more years of life, it means more healthy years, as the body shows increased resistance to cancer and other degenerative diseases. It's a subject worth studying.</p>

Eating out Americans spend close to half of their food budget having professionals cook for them. This is the equivalent of a third of my entire budget--not just for food; for everything. The solution is to dial down restaurant visits to the point where they again become special and exciting rather than expected.
For those who eat out for social reasons, instead of meeting at a restaurant,
take turns meeting at each other's homes.</p>
    
    <p> Either take turns cooking for each other or make every gathering a potluck. If you're really enterprising, start a "club" with your neighbors, each taking a turn cooking. With seven families, you only have to cook once a week.
Cooking For fuel you need a certain combination of amino acids, carbohydrates and essential fats (see Building blocks).</p>
    
    <p>93 These can be acquired in a multitude of ways and from different ingredients. The ingredients can be combined in various ways--recipes. It's noted that recipes also follow general principles and that it's worthwhile to learn these principles. For example, baking involves a grain product (typically flour), liquid (typically water or milk), butter, yeast or baking soda, combined with a sour product,
butter, and a sweetener (sugar, honey, molasses, etc.</p>
    
    <p>). Practically any baked product can be made out of these ingredients and they each serve a very specific purpose in that certain types of bread, muffin, or cake will always have some of them but not others. A little experimenting will reveal this.
Just remember that flour and liquids are always needed; anything else is optional.</p>
