    <p> As we learned from the story of Charles Darwin and the ship’s log he kept on the HMS Beagle, a habit of continuous offloading— through the use of a daily journal or field notebook—can extend our ability to make fresh observations and synthesize new ideas. And as we saw in the example of historian Robert Caro, offloading information onto a space that’s big enough for us to physically navigate (wall-sized outlines, oversized concept maps, multiple-monitor workstations) allows us to apply to that material our powers of spatial reasoning and spatial memory.
Externalizing information takes a more involved form: it may entail carefully designing a task such that one part of the task is offloaded even as another part absorbs our full attention. This was the practice adopted by law professor Monte Smith, who had his students offload the task of structuring a legal memo onto a model while they focused their efforts on understanding and articulating their newly acquired knowledge of the law.</p>
    
    <p> Offloading need not require written language, either. At times, offloading may be embodied: when we gesture, for example, we permit our hands to “hold” some of the thoughts we would otherwise have to maintain in our head. Likewise, when we use our hands to move objects around, we offload the task of visualizing new configurations onto the world itself, where those configurations take tangible shape before our eyes.
(Picture an interior designer manipulating a model as she tries out new groupings of furniture, for example, or a Scrabble player rearranging the tiles on his tray to form new words.</p>
    
    <p>) At other times, offloading may be social: we’ve seen how engaging in argument allows us to distribute among human debaters the task of tallying points for and against a given proposition; we’ve learned how constructing a transactive memory system offloads onto our colleagues the task of monitoring and remembering incoming information. Offloading also occurs in an interpersonal context when we externalize “traces” of our own thinking processes for the benefit of our teammates; in this case, we’re offloading not to unburden our own minds but to facilitate collaboration with others.
Onward to the second principle: whenever possible, we should endeavor to transform information into an artifact, to make data into something real—and then proceed to interact with it, labeling it, mapping it, feeling it, tweaking it,
showing it to others. Humans evolved to handle the concrete, not to contemplate the abstract.</p>
    
    <p> We extend our intelligence when we give our minds something to grab onto: when we experience a concept from physics as a bicycle wheel spinning in our hands, for example, or when we turn a foreign language vocabulary word into a gesture we can see and sense and demonstrate to others.
Vague impressions of what constitutes “excellent work” can usefully take form as a display of actual models to which to aspire (remember “Austin’s Butterfly”?); dry intellectual deliberations can acquire a rooted, embodied dimension when we closely attend to, and label and track, the internal signals that arise in our bodies. Our days are now spent processing an endless stream of symbols; with a bit of ingenuity, we can find ways to turn these abstract symbols into tangible objects and sensory experiences, and thereby think about them in new ways.
In a related vein, the third principle: whenever possible, we should seek to productively alter our own state when engaging in mental labor.</p>
    
    <p> We’ve repeatedly confronted the limits of the brain-as-computer analogy, and here we come up against perhaps its most conspicuous flaw. When fed a chunk of information, a computer processes it in the same way on each occasion— whether it’s been at work for five minutes or five hours, whether it’s located in a fluorescent-lit office or positioned next to a sunny window, whether it’s near other computers or is the only computer in the room. This is how computers operate, but the same doesn’t hold for human beings. The way we’re able to think about information is dramatically affected by the state we’re in when we encounter it.</p>
    
    <p>
Effective mental extension, then, requires us to think carefully about inducing in ourselves the state that is best suited for the task at hand. We might engage in a bout of brisk exercise before sitting down to learn something new, for example; we might seek out an opportunity to engage in group synchrony and shared physical arousal (spicy food, anyone?) when we’re expected to work together as a team. We might get up from our desk and get our hands and bodies moving when we’re seeking to understand a spatial concept; we might plan a three-day trip into the wilderness when we’re in need of a creative boost.
Deliberately altering our own state could entail taking a walk in a nearby park when our frazzled attention requires restoration, or seeking out a sparring partner with whom to argue when we want to make sure our ideas are sound.</p>
    
    <p> Instead of heedlessly driving the brain like a machine, we’ll think more intelligently when we treat it as the context-sensitive organ it is.
The second set of principles offers a higher-level view of how mental extension works, in accordance with an understanding of what the brain evolved to do. The brain is well adapted to sensing and moving the body, to navigating through physical space, and to interacting with other members of our species. On top of this basic suite of human competencies, civilization has built a vast edifice of abstraction, engaging our brains in acts of symbolic processing and conceptual cognition that don’t come as naturally.</p>
    
    <p> These abstractions have, of course, allowed us to expand our powers exponentially—but now, paradoxically,
further progress may depend on running this process in reverse. In order to succeed at the increasingly complex thinking modern life demands, we will find ourselves needing to translate abstractions back into the corporeal, spatial, and social forms from which they sprang—forms with which the brain is still most at ease.
We can begin to understand what this means by taking up the fourth principle:
whenever possible, we should take measures to re-embody the information we think about. The pursuit of knowledge has frequently sought to disengage thinking from the body, to elevate ideas to a cerebral sphere separate from our grubby animal anatomy.</p>
