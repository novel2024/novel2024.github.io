    <p> Reward is often correlated with risk, where risk can either be quantified as volatility or qualified as uncertainty (lack of knowledge). This means that the higher the return rate, the higher the risk of loss of capital.
Another principle, however, says that risk is more related to skill and knowledge. Both of these statements are true, but for different reasons.</p>
    
    <p> If you think about a fast race car, it's a more risky vehicle to drive, but if you know how to drive it, the risk goes down.
There are two conclusions from this. First, having a margin of safety in terms of principal is a good idea. In other words, having a low withdrawal rate is safer than a high withdrawal rate, because the required rate of return is lower.</p>
    
    <p> A larger fund thus allows for more safety. Second, invest in what you understand rather than what people tell you. This is the main reason I'm not telling you what to invest in. If you don't know anything about investing, make it a point to learn! It will be your new financial function in the world.</p>
    
    <p> There's no hurry--as was shown in Financial independence and investing, the investment return i is fairly unimportant during the accumulation period as long as it is short. A lot of learning can happen during those years--people go to college and get degrees in the time you have to learn how to manage your money.
I invest in stocks because I've spent almost a decade reading about stock investing. Conversely, I know little about real estate investment.</p>
    
    <p> If you're more interested in real estate, perhaps you should invest in that instead.
Some people own timber land and every few years they sell lumber and live off the proceeds. The reason I invest in stocks is a combination of personal interest, personal temperament, and historical accident. It's not because I have determined they are a superior investment by any means.</p>
    
    <p>
Each market has its idiosyncratic volatility and return rates. Timber, for instance, grows independent of what the market does, at a rate of about 3- 4% per year. If prices are low, you simply wait to cut until they are high again. As lumber remains a major part of the economy, it can be expected to rise in price in sync with inflation.</p>
    
    <p> The US stock market has historically returned about 10% nominally--other stock markets have returned different amounts. Note that this result includes a significant two-decade-long bull market between 1983 and 2000. Other times, it has been flat for decades. In the periods 1905-1942, 1965-1983 and 2000-2007 market return was either zero or negative.</p>
    
    <p> Some of these periods are really long! If the investment strategy relies on capital gains, as it does in a buy and hold strategy, this will lead to failure if the withdrawal rate is too high during years of decline,
as too much stock will be liquidated when the market is low. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a withdrawal rate of 4% is good for 30 years of inflation-adjusted expenses and that a withdrawal rate of 3% is good for 60 years or more. A withdrawal rate of 2% will last forever--that is, if history repeats itself.
In the long run, real estate always goes up .</p>
