Closer to home, I’m deeply grateful for the support and insight of Miryam Welbourne; the calm presence and good humor of Darcy Chase; and the devoted fathering of my co-parent, John Witt. I honor the work of my children’s teachers: at the Calvin Hill Day Care Center and Kitty Lustman-Findling Kindergarten, the Foote School, and Hopkins School. Finally, I give thanks for my family: my mother, Nancy Paul; the memory of my father, Tim Paul; my sister, Sally Paul; Sally’s partner, Billy Fowks; and their son, Frankie Fowks.</p>

And to my beloved sons, Teddy Witt and Gus Witt: more than anyone else,
you two have led me to become a different person—transformed, in the best way, by my interactions with you.
