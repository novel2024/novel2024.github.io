Driving The thing that most Americans live for and which permeates the entire culture, the car, is an incredibly expensive piece of machinery, with barriers to nonownership that must be dealt with emotionally and physically. It's likely that universal car ownership was one of the larger mistakes of American society. When few people have cars, cars means freedom. When everybody has cars, cars mean sitting in endless lines, emitting pollution,
and not having a car means freedom.</p>
    
    <p> Many people are in such poor shape that they can't get anywhere under their own power. This is a physical barrier to nonownership. However, anyone can walk efficiently with practice. I still remember getting passed by several 60+-year-olds during a two day double-marathon walk--I had no training; they had plenty--happily marching along, commenting on the pretty flowers while I was dragging my 18-year-old sedentary feet along, only concentrating on the next painful step.</p>
    
    <p> Many believe that not having a car is unsafe, despite the fact that more people die in automobile accidents than are killed by guns every year. This is a mental barrier to car nonownership.
Next to housing cost, transportation costs are American's second biggest source of expenses. Car ownership has some or all of the following costs:
1.</p>
    
    <p> Depreciation, leasing, or debt servicing costs. Leasing or debt servicing costs are relevant if you don't own your car outright. If you own your car outright and you intend to replace it, depreciation costs become relevant. For instance, $12,000 for a car that lasts 10 years costs $100 a month.</p>
    
    <p> That requires $40,100 in extra savings (see this equation in Investing and reasonable return rates).
2. Gasoline and insurance. These are unavoidable if you want to drive your car anywhere, except perhaps downhill on backroads.</p>
    
    <p>
3. Opportunity and health costs from sitting behind the wheel when you could be exercising.
The average American spends 20% of his income on transportation.
That is 0.</p>
    
    <p>20×12=2.4 months a year of work. That is a lot of time that could be used for something better. Assuming he also spends an hour daily in his car commuting, then that is 250 hours a year, assuming 250 working days.</p>
    
    <p>
That is 1/8 of the working day on top of the working day or 1/8 of the working month on top of the working month. Hence, that is 12/8 = 1.5 working months in addition, meaning we end up working four months a year driving and earning transportation funds.
Hence if it would otherwise take you six years of work to retire, if you own a car you will only be able to save (12-4)/12 as much, so your time until retirement would extend to 12/(12-4)×6=9 years, or three additional years simply due to driving.</p>
