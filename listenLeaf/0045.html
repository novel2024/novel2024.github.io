Stay ahead of the game Predators are constantly changing the rules of the game because they know the rest of the population is catching up. For instance, some predators have taken to placing harmful messages in seemingly harmless kidsâ€™ videos and other content. Online games and the constant social media challenges are also at times used to manipulate, and influence children do engage in practices that are harmful to them. As a parent, you must ensure that you are aware of the trick and treachery being used to manipulate your kid and then nip this in the bud before it is too late.</p>

What If Your Child is the Problem?
Nobody wants to believe that their child might be anywhere near being a psychopath, sociopath, or narcissist. And yet, adults who score highly on the dark triad were once children. We want to believe the best of our children,
but perhaps this is the denial that causes parents to miss out on opportunities of helping the kids get help before it is too late.
First, it is important to note that psychologists are not fond of calling children psychopaths even when these children exhibit behaviors that are worrying and abnormal.</p>
    
    <p> This is simply because the term itself carries too much stigma and finality. When a child is called a psychopath at age six who is not to say that they will not aspire to grow to live up to the name? Also,
children are just that--they may be troublesome as kids and then turned out to be something totally different when they are older. Instead of antisocial personality disorder, therefore, children are often diagnosed with conduct disorder. In order for this diagnosis to be given, a kid must meet certain criteria that have been agreed upon and behave in a manner to exhibit these criteria for at least six months.</p>
    
    <p> What this means is that a teenager who behaves aggressively in one or two instances is not exactly a candidate for conduct disorder. More likely than not, they are just having a bad day. So,
who qualifies for the conduct disorder spectrum?
A child that has a high chance of becoming a psychopath in their later life exhibits the following characteristics:
They extremely lack in empathy. This is the sort of child who will not flinch when their friend gets hurt on the playground.</p>
    
    <p> In fact,
you might even catch them laughing at the pain of others.
They lack remorse and guilt. A child who does not have remorse or guilt will do wrong and not feel the need to apologize for it.
They might hit their little brother or hurl the family pet against the wall and smile about it.</p>
    
    <p> When asked to apologize, they will be stubborn and might even completely refuse to cooperate.
They are indifferent to punishment. Most children get very dramatic when punished. They sob their little hearts out and even try to make you feel bad about punishing them.</p>
    
    <p> Not so for children with conduct disorder. More often than not, such children will not care for the punishment. They will not be moved one bit and will ensure that you know they are not moved. This is simply because they do not experience pain and emotions like everybody else.</p>
    
    <p>
Lastly, adults who went on to become full-on psychopaths exhibited signs of aggression and cruelty in their childhood.
Because a child is a tiny individual who does not have much strength to take on bigger victims, children will often target helpless animals to take out their aggression and cruelty on. If one day your child wakes up and kills the family cat, you should be very worried.
What do you do when you are faced with a child who displays all these signs? The first thing you need to do is understand that not every psychopath is headed for doom and destruction.</p>
