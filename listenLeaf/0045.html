    <p> Gesturing students also learn more than those who observe the gesture but don’t enact it themselves. Studies by other researchers have found that math students solve problems more quickly, and generalize their new knowledge more effectively, after they have been taught by an avatar that gestures than by one that does not. Online instructional resources—including commercial language- learning platforms like Duolingo and Rosetta Stone—might be made much more effective by adding an animated agent who induces users to engage in gesture.
In addition to reinforcing memory, designed gestures can lighten our mental load.</p>
    
    <p> Gesturing offloads our cognitive burden in much the same way as making a list or drawing a diagram on a piece of paper—except that we always have our hands with us, ready to assume some of the weight. (Indeed, studies show that when people are given challenging problems to solve but are prohibited from using pencil and paper, they gesture more to compensate.) A familiar example of such offloading is the way young children count on their fingers when working out a math problem. Their fingers “hold” an intermediate sum so that their minds are free to think about the mathematical operation they must execute (addition,
subtraction) to reach the final answer.</p>
    
    <p> More complex or conceptual gestures serve a similar purpose for older children and adults. Our hands offer our heads overflow capacity, such that we can manage a greater volume of information overall, and can subject that information to a greater number of acts of manipulation and transformation.
In pursuit of that additional capacity, some teachers purposely show their students how to shift information onto their hands. Washington State math teacher Brendan Jeffreys turned to gesture as a way of easing the mental load carried by his students, many of whom come from low-income households,
speak English as a second language, or both.</p>
    
    <p> “Academic language—vocabulary terms like ‘congruent’ and ‘equivalent’ and ‘quotient’—is not something my students hear in their homes, by and large,” says Jeffreys, who works for the Auburn School District in Auburn, a small city south of Seattle. “I could see that my kids were stumbling over those words even as they were trying to keep track of the numbers and perform the mathematical operations.” So Jeffreys devised a set of simple hand gestures to accompany, or even temporarily replace, the unfamiliar terms that taxed his students’ ability to carry out mental math.
To signify that an angle is acute, Jeffreys taught them, “make Pac-Man with your arms.</p>
    
    <p>” To signify that it is obtuse, “spread out your arms like you’re going to hug someone.” And to signify a right angle, “flex an arm like you’re showing off your muscle.” For addition, bring two hands together; for division, make a karate chop; to find the area of a shape, “motion as if you’re using your hand as a knife to butter bread.” Jeffreys’s students enthusiastically adopted the gestures, and they now employ them while talking in class, while doing homework, and even while taking tests,
he reports.</p>
    
    <p> As they become more adept at executing the mathematical operations themselves, the students are often able to reincorporate the academic language that had confused them initially—a benefit of the mental spaciousness made possible by the load-lightening effects of gesture. Jeffreys’s approach has proved so successful in helping his students learn math that he has been asked to extend it to all twenty-two schools in his district. He is now at work on developing a set of gestures to support students in reading and writing: motions that indicate terms like “character,” “setting,” “summary,” and “main point.” As Brendan Jeffreys’s students have discovered, our hands are impressively flexible tools.</p>
    
    <p> They can represent so many things: an entrepreneur’s vision for his product; an infant’s step toward spoken language; a teacher’s clue that a student is ready to learn. Hands can be a prompt, a window, a way station—but what they ought never have to be is still.
PART II THINKING WITH OUR SURROUNDINGS 4 Thinking with Natural Spaces AS THE SUMMER OF 1945 came to an end, the artist Jackson Pollock was approaching a breaking point. New York City, where he lived in a downtown apartment, felt increasingly frenetic and chaotic.</p>
    
    <p> His ever-present struggles with drinking and depression seemed to be worsening. His wife, the painter Lee Krasner, worried about his mental health.
In August, Pollock and Krasner went to visit friends on the East End of Long Island, then a quiet home to farmers and fishermen, as well as a few artists and writers. Pollock felt both soothed and stimulated by the place: the light, the green, the cool breezes blowing in from Long Island Sound.</p>
