    <p>26 It is hard to master even one narrowly scoped field of knowledge (see The cost of specialization), let alone two or more. Some people therefore claim that it is impossible to be a true polymath anymore. In my opinion, the modern ideal of a polymath should therefore not be an absolute measure of mastery in all subjects.
Instead, the objective should be to strive for competence in a range of important subjects.</p>
    
    <p> Don't worry about whether you can eventually become an expert (see Gauging mastery). Rather, try to constantly improve on the subjects you already know and seek out useful things to learn.
With a process-oriented attitude you'll eventually master several subjects. Once a threshold is reached, the synergy between different subjects will help you create new solutions.</p>
    
    <p> Since all human knowledge is based on a limited number of mental models, the stronger and wider this foundation of models is, the easier it is to gain new knowledge. A similar principle holds for physical abilities, emotional maturity, social networks,
economic power, technical understanding, and one's ability to integrate with the world. Perhaps now more than ever there's a need for people who understand and are able to connect different interdisciplinary topics, lest we end up in a Tower of Babel situation where specialists and experts no longer understand each other.
The ability to connect disparate fields or items in complex ways and reach new creative solutions creates paradigm shifts.</p>
    
    <p> It was the universal ideal that led to the discovery of the scientific method, the rediscovery of democracy, and the settling of a new continent, all of which created the world we see today (see Succession and the cycle of change). It's also the universal ideal that spurs the occasional renegade to discover something completely different like the general theory of relativity, string theory, or chaos theory.
Conversely, the present methodical, milestone-governed specialist approach is largely a mopping-up operation which leads to increasing levels of detail but no new ways of understanding things. This way of thinking has dominated our culture for some time, where problems are formulated and solved within the present framework of thinking, leading to the world and way of life described in The lock-in.</p>
    
    <p> If you want to change your life, don't be tempted to outsource your life or your operations. You'll never know which kind of connections or synergies you're missing and you'll only make yourself more dependent on your suppliers.
Human capital and necessary personal assets As mentioned in The lock-in, it is interesting that we refer to "primitive" people27 as primitive, when every primitive person is able to build his own tools and shelter, make his own clothes, provide heat and water, and knows what food is edible and what isn't. How many of us are capable of that? His technology may be primitive, but his general knowledge of his world far surpasses ours.</p>
    
    <p> A "primitive" can competently participate in every aspect of what his culture does. In contrast, we only know something about a very limited number of things in our culture, such as our job training and functions, and the only thing we share in common are opinions about local restaurants, the fictitious lives of the characters in a couple of TV serials,
and a rudimentary understanding of the weather forecast. In that regard, our society is more akin to a highly developed insect colony where specialized members work for the greater whole.
Given the lack of diversity of individuals' skills, the popular measure of how well we're doing is given by a single number: Our net worth, or salary for those who don't have a net worth.</p>
    
    <p> Open any book on personal finance and one of the first numbers introduced is the concept of net worth. Your net worth is equal to the sum of all your financial assets, house,
investments, and possessions minus the sum of all your financial liabilities,
mortgages, and loans. This can be positive or negative, but it is still a one- dimensional number.
Net worth is only useful as a measuring stick if everybody plays the same game and has the same form of consumption.</p>
    
    <p> It is only useful in a world where money is earned with one skill and the lack of all other skills is compensated for by spending money.
However, real people, even specialists, are not so one-dimensional. A person may be able to cook his own food (reheating pizzas or boiling noodles is not cooking!). Compared to a person that needs to go out to eat or buy more expensive preprocessed food, that skill is an asset, because the person needs less money to eat.</p>
