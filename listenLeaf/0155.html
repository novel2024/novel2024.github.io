    <p> It was also clear that if I didn't manage to get the correct result, it was no big deal since my work was in a certain sense redundant, as it was being duplicated by all my classmates. Furthermore, I was always being told "what" to do and "when" to do it. In that sense, what an institutional education resulting in a college degree does is to facilitate the replacement of your parents with your future boss(es), moving you from being dependent on your parents knowing better to being dependent on an employer knowing better.
Doing the doctorate, which aims for a very different goal--namely to produce independent researchers capable of doing original research--made me realize that the "They" or "Them" that people always mention in the phrase, "They'll think of something," had actually become me.</p>
    
    <p> As a result, I always feel slightly worried when I hear the phrase, "They'll think of something..." This changed my attitude towards problems and solutions and I began to use the same approach that I used for my research job in the rest of my life, always trying to understand why something was the way it was,
whether it could be different, and if so, how?
Instead of adopting the standard moneymanagement plan of saving 15% in an index fund in my retirement plan while getting in debt up to my eyeballs thanks to a "starter home," I started looking into the principles behind the system I was living in.</p>
    
    <p> I realized that the standard option of becoming an indebted consumer was just one of many, but that if anyone wanted different options, they'd have to take a different and more active approach rather than just asking "what?" and "when?" I would need another plan. More accurately, I would need a strategy, and to make such a strategy,
I would need to understand the underlying principles and the world they operated in. Since there are no career tracks available for aspiring Renaissance people, we necessarily have to work with the options that are available to us and bend them to our purposes. Since everybody has different options available to them, I didn't think presenting a specific plan would be very helpful, so this is the main reason for its absence.</p>
    
    <p> My own history doesn't seem to follow a plan, specifically because there was no plan. I was increasing my understanding as I went along; eventually crystallizing it into the philosophy I've written down in this book. Despite not having a plan, I had an intuitive grasp of the strategy and guiding principles, and I quickly learned most of the tactics since these are very similar to standard frugal practice. The only thing left to do was to pick the level of effort (extreme) and stay disciplined.</p>
    
    <p>
I like the goal I eventually reached. I love not having to work for money, which means that not only do I get to set my own hours, something which is also possible for the self-employed, but more importantly, I also get to spend all day doing things that don't necessarily need to be done to meet some income quota to put food on the table, like serving on a board of directors for a nonprofit startup, volunteering my time for bike repair,
crewing in yacht races, etc. Nor do I expect to remain interested in the same subjects all my life or that I'll follow a career track someone else laid out for me.
My withdrawal rate is very conservative, so my stream of money will very likely never run out.</p>
    
    <p> In fact, simply by doing nothing I'm more likely to end up with more than $1 million in net worth when I reach traditional retirement age, which is much more than what most consumers will manage to save. I'm set for life and I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,
within reason, as long as I don't fall into any consumer traps. Having about 20 diversified streams of income from different investments, I never worry about being unemployed and not having a job. Yet many are afraid of diversified investment income, despite having their job as their sole source of income, and by implication, their only source of food, shelter, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>
The only reason that relying on just one job for money isn't considered risky is because it's a normal way of life, and most have gotten used to it or at least accept it much like they accept the risk of driving bumper to bumper at 55mph on the freeway, despite the real possibility of the driver ahead of them suddenly losing control for whatever reason. If more people spent five years saving money and learning how to live efficiently on their investments instead of spending five years to become plumbers or MBAs and zero years on living efficiently, and therefore working for the rest of their lives, financial freedom might not seem so scary. For those who are still unsure, consider that the worst thing that can happen to me, compared to someone who works for a living, is that I have to go back to work and do what they have been doing all along. Yet if the market falls sufficiently to cause me to struggle, most people will have lost their retirement savings as well and we would be in an economic situation with at least 30% unemployment.</p>
    
    <p> Relying on a salaried full-time job to make a living therefore does not seem any safer. In such a scenario, who would you consider more likely to do well, a consumer who relies on shopping for all his needs or someone living as I do? When I was younger, I used to deride the idea of jocks and how being a college athlete certainly didn't contribute to education; now I believe it does. The most important part of education is forming your character (see Ergodicity and destiny), whether as a worker,
capitalist, leader, or follower, or whether you deal with people--that is, the social and the political--or reality. Participating in sports certainly builds character.</p>
